Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc Andy Levi -- Avon Capital Advisor Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research Operator :  Good morning, everyone and welcome to the CMS Energy 2014 First Quarter Results and Outlook Call. This call is being recorded. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at noon Eastern Time, running through May 1. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Barba, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead. Glenn Barba : Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings including our 10-K for the fiscal year 2013 identified some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Our SEC filings are available on our website. This presentation also include non-GAAP measures, reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures are included in the Appendix to the presentation and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that I'll turn the call over to John. John Russell : Thanks, Glenn and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of 2014, then we will close with Q&A. We are off to a good start in 2014. For the first quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.75. This is up $0.22 from last year primarily due to the winter weather and strong cost performance. First quarter results keep us on track to meet our full year guidance of $1.74 to $1.78 per share. Tom will provide the details in a few minutes. You can see from this graph how this winter compared to those of the last 100 years. It was consistently cold from November through March. The winter put our gas system to the test and I am pleased to report it performed very well. Total gas deliveries were up nearly 25% due to the weather. And there were no major service interruptions. Here you can see where we are putting our gas investments to work. The $175 million upgrade at the Ray Compressor Station increased reliability to meet peak demand. And the $120 million Southwest Michigan Pipeline currently under construction will increase the transmission system capacity and reliability. Our gas system is the fourth largest in the United States. During the first quarter, we delivered almost 160 billion cubic feet of natural gas to our 1.7 million customers. About half of the deliveries come from our storage fields. Consumers have one of the largest storage systems in the country and the highest level of deliverability at 4 billion cubic feet a day. Our storage field help protect customers from volatile price spikes, which many experienced during this past winter specially in March. Over the last -- over the next 10 years we plan to invest $5 billion in gas transmission, distribution and storage systems.  In 2013, strong cost performance and favorable weather allowed us to reinvest back into the business for our customers. This model allows continuing to focus on cost performance and reinvestment within the year. We have been doing this now for several years which are unique in the industry. We believe this improves performance for our customers and our investors. The result of our model is sustainable growth. Each year our growth builds on the previous year's performance without weather adjustments. Within the year, we pull-aheads work to accelerate the pace of improvement for our customers. And the yearend results are delivered for investors with predictable and consistent growth. Again this year we plan to take advantage of the cold weather to reinvest for our customers. In the first quarter, we benefited from favorable weather of $0.20 and strong cost performance of $0.04, allowing us to begin our reinvestment plan earlier than last year. Tom will go through the numbers with you in more detail. But I want to make the point again about sustainable, consistent growth strategy. In the first quarter, our cost savings alone allowed us to beat our 5% to 7% growth rate. Our strategy differentiates us from our peers.  The Michigan Energy Law is working well. But there is an opportunity to make the law even better in 2015. The governor has developed a set of no regrets principles shown in the green circle. We support his vision and work closely with his administration and legislators. Near term, the House Energy and Technology Committee held hearings on electric deregulation. There was strong opposition to the bill. And the committee took no action. The administration is looking at options to establish a tariff for energy intensive customers. And a legislature may take action on that. In the gas business, I expect the House will propose legislation to expand gas mains. We will support this effort because it works -- it will accelerate convergence from propane to natural gas.  Looking into 2015, we see the possibility of an increase in renewable energy portfolio standard, continuation of energy efficiency goals, regulatory improvements and the potential elimination of retail open access. We look forward to working with the governor and the legislators to make Michigan a more attractive state for business. Next, Tom will take you through the details for the quarter. Tom Webb : Well, thanks John. And let me add my welcome to everybody on the call today. It's always good to have you. For the first quarter, our earnings were $0.75 a share on both a reported and we are pleased to say an adjusted basis is. This is $0.22 better than last year, normalized for weather as John mentioned this is up $0.05 or 10% from last year. This reflects strong cost performance and investment driven growth nicely above are 5% to 7% earnings growth pattern. Avoiding gas rate cases for both the gas and the electric businesses this year, it was made possible through $150 million of cost reductions initiated last year. As we just discussed weather normalized results were up $0.05 or 10% in the first quarter alone. For the nine months ahead you can see with yellow arrow that cold weather up $0.17 has provided considerable space to pull-aheads work from 2015 to 2014. You can also see on the dotted circle the cost savings this year, fully funded our planned investments. Here is a recap of cost performance before and after reinvestment. Our underlying cost reduction shown in green was 8% last year and we expect the 8% this year. The savings are offset by about 5% of work pull-ahead from the next year : Pull-aheads permitted primarily by favorable weather in 2013 and so far in 2014 as well. The pull-aheads includes actions like incremental tree trimming for reliability, faster pole and pipe maintenance as well as accelerated plant maintenance outage. Cost reductions cover a variety of items including actions like plan benefit savings, faster installation, smart meters and more productivity. Even after reinvestment, our costs are down about 3% a year. Our cost reduction track record is better than most peers and shown in orange. At present, we plan future cost reduction at about 2% a year, reducing our O&M from a $1.055 billion last year to $930 million by 2018. This is a net reduction of $125 million which is down 12% and a bit more than 2% a year. This may well be conservative because we do not believe in our count on black boxes. We plan on cost savings that we know about including actions like gas in place of coal generation, reforming our benefit programs and implementing specific plans for productivity. We are confident in substantial cost savings ahead making headroom for more capital investment. But perhaps there's little more upside.  Let's switch to revenue. Our electric sales have been better than many others as Michigan continues to grow particularly in our service territory. As shown in the top left of this slide, key economic indicators like building permits and GDP growth and population and unemployment in our major service area are meaningfully stronger than Michigan as well as the U.S. overall. For example, during the latest reported 12 months to February, building permits were up 16% in the U.S., they are 25% in Michigan and 39% in Grand Rapids. For the first quarter weather normalized electric sales were up 1.7%. For the full-year, we anticipate a similar growth rate. Over the next several years, we plan conservatively in a bit over 0.5%.  We prefer upside opportunities not downside risk. Our EPS growth over the next five years is not however dependent on strong load growth. Our growth is based on needed investment and solid productivity. Low growth over and above are conservative estimates could be another catalyst. We've not factor this into our plan and perhaps this is another upside. We are not however without need to improve. We do have substantial investment ahead to catch up on. This investment allows us to meet environmental requirements, add more renewable, improve reliability and enhance productivity. Our bills are competitive for our residential customers but rates are not competitive for many of our industrial customers. In many circumstances these rates are higher than rates in other Midwestern states. We're working hard to correct this through our own substantial cost performance and improve rate design. And this could make us more like our Midwest peers. Also, possible policy changes could eliminate or reduce existing penalties that all our customers pay to subsidize a few customers on retail open access. While we have the lowest overhead in our business and among the very best O&M cost performance and advantages like procuring low cost gas to our huge storage fields. We still have disadvantages including our geographic location on a peninsula remote from fuel supplies. Our goal is to work with our customers, our regulators and policymakers to provide fully competitive prices and reliability, exactly what our customers should expect from us. So a great deal of our capital investment focuses on more productivity, the improved reliability, completing environmental projects in a major reduction in carbon output to levels below the president's goal. Our investment in plants using gas and renewable fuels helps to make this possible. Even as we limit the level of capital investment to keep base rate growth below inflation, this investment catch up provides resources to make necessary improvements. We have opportunities to spend more than $20 billion over the next 10 years and all nice bite-size no bet the planet projects. We've included $15 billion in our plans and limited only by that passion to keep customer rates and bills down. Even after recently pulling ahead $545 million of investment, investment and gas infrastructure, smart energy and electric reliability as well reinvesting almost $390 million in the gas business associated with securitizing coal plants, we have $5 billion of investment opportunity not in our plans perhaps more upside.  Here is just one example of capital investment growth opportunities not in our plan. We likely will need to build or secure over 2500 megawatts of capacity just to replace expiring PPAs and coal plant closures. We already have secured 540 megawatts with the acquisition of the combined cycle gas plant in Jackson. With conservative load growth estimates and the possibility of customers returning to bundled service, and need for secure capacity may be even larger. And we are confident that we can fill those needs. So here's the map for this additional capacity, it is attractive for both customers and investors. If for example we build just a thousand megawatts of new capacity is good at $0.05 of EPS growth or about two points of headroom to our long-term guidance. And that's without increasing customer bills. The rate impact of adding a new capacity is likely to be equal to or less than the cost associated with expiring PPAs. Customers and investors win again. We are not however raising long-term guidance. These capacity additions, need additions are not in our plan yet. This investment opportunity will allow us to redeploy resources in a manner that further strengthen the likelihood of consistent 5% to 7% growth. Our investment driven model is not so unique but we work it well enough to improve our gross operating cash flow by about by about $100 million each year, and in some years we've exceeded that substantially. We self fund our growth with no need for block equity on the five year horizon. As a percent of market cap today, our spending levels now exceed peers with strong additional growth ahead. As a risk adverse company, our operating cash flow and liquidity are higher too. And this is a nice place to be.  You can see our liquidity here with over $2 billion available in a robust financing plan. Our liquidity as percent market cap shown at the bottom right exceeds peer levels. Moody's upgraded both CMS and Consumers just two months ago; Fitch upgraded the CMS Energy parent's unsecured rating to BBB- and revised the outlook to stable. And in last month S&P change their outlook from stable to positive. And here is our sensitivity chart. This will help you assess our prospects. And here's our report card for 2014. Obviously, the Arctic blast -- with that Arctic blast we'd be well ahead of earnings guidance. We will however work to put this surplus to good use with even more reliability improvements for our customers. You'll note we graded ourselves with an orange check on operating cash flow. Although we anticipate achieving our target, we had not planned on the high price of gas transportation for incremental gas purchase beyond what we had contracted and what we had in our storage fields. As shown on the earlier sensitivity slide, each increase or decrease in the price of gas by about a $1 impact our cash flow by $100 million in the opposite direction. This is a pass through but some of this may be recovered in 2015 rather than 2014. So we are on course to meet all of our financial targets with substantial upside and earnings. We are actively redeploying some of the surplus to improve the lot of our customers with no adverse consequences for you our investors.  The mindset for customers and investors has worked and we hope you agree. We are in our 12 year of premier earnings and dividend growth, and we plan to continue this performance for some time.  So thank you again for joining us on our call today and we would be pleased to take your questions. Operator? Operator :  (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers, Credit Suisee. Please proceed. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for the update on Slide 16 on the capacity your resource opportunity. Can you just maybe talk a little about you where you guys sit from a functional reserve margin between what you guys own what you haven't a contract and then how much you having to buy out the market right now on a spot or normalized base over the course of the year? John Russell : Yeah, Dan, we have got enough capacity now for our customer load. That's not an issue for us as far as that. Next few years we'll probably be in the market for a few hundred but very small from that standpoint. So I think Tom was showing in the chart which is important pieces, we are shutting down coal which were beginning to replace, we'll buy more from the market and as the PPA expire will need to have replacement capacity, will makes us a bit unique here I think very unique is the fact that we do -- we are heavily dependent on PPAs compared to other utilities. So as those expire allows us to do the development here and raise our capital investment without raising the cost to our customers. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities LLC : And I guess, John, there is a couple of contingencies out there obviously what happens with choice in the 780 megawatt and then the survivability I suppose of Palisades as it gets older and the prospects for a PPA beyond your PPA or probably harder to find, how are you guessing about contingency planning for both these issues and if choice does get eliminated early next year, is that -- would that accelerate the need maybe to revisit Thetford? John Russell : Yes, exactly. You hit it. I mean that the issue we have a great site Thetford, we are ready to move ahead with it, the opportunity presented itself with the plan here in Jackson, it was best for us and for our customers we took advantage of it. The Thetford site is ready to go, we do have expandability and be changing out some of our simple cycle to combined cycle, it is even plan Thetford can begin at the simple cycle moved to combined cycle, so we are well positioned to be able to move. I'd say quickly but again building plans nothing is quick, but having the sites and having all that work already behind us really would help us move quickly as retail open access returns, as coal plants are shutdown and as some of these PPAs expire. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities LLC : And with choice being replaced it with your own generation, would that prospectively be added to the growth rate because presumably the revenues coming back and to pay for that generation, would you mitigate the concerns you guys always have about your bill versus your customer? John Russell :   Absolutely, absolutely and the fact that ROA customers would come back also means that the wall was it as far as coal being reduced, the capacity markets increasing to the normal levels, we are more competitive and we will be in a very good position to be able to build with that pretty substantial that you saw there, it is almost 800 megawatts of load if it did return. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: Yes, good morning. Could I ask you just talk a little bit about where you are on days of coal supply of deliverability and if weather being constrained, is got a changing dispatch and then how you expect the summer to play out? John Russell : Yes, we fell below our normal levels this winter and I think it's what the industry is experience with some of the real disruptions primarily due to the cold weather. We've been able to make up about seven days of inventory over the past few weeks, so we been making up ground and we would be putting some more railcars to work, we do have a couple scheduled outages especially at Campbell 3, our biggest plant which is helped us get back on track so we are little bit below normal levels today, but I do feel good that there's finally most of the ice is gone out of the Great Lakes so we do have the opportunity different than other utilities to bring in coal with barge, through barges and we are also making progress as I said with a seven day increase over the last several weeks. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: John, can you just kind of frame -- so how low did you go and where are you now with that seven delta? John Russell : What would I say lowest we ever hit was about 14 days that was the lowest and what we did as a result of that as we began to conserve our western coal which is cheaper for our customers by working for minimum dispatch on weekends and doing some different things like that? So that did help increase it. And keep in mind we have still have the ability to burn Eastern coal which we have those coal piles too but we chose to use Western because of the environmental and customer benefits. So moving up from 14 we are up to and above 21 days right now. We like to be in the 25 to 35 days going into summer, and I expect we will be there especially now that lakes have opened up. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha, SunTrust. Please proceed. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you, good morning. First off on the 2014 guidance by the segments Slide 25 I believe enterprise you are assuming will contribute about $0.11 or so to earnings in 2014 which is significantly higher than what they being running for the last several years. Can you just remind us what's causing that pickup this year? Tom Webb : It is about the same and what you are reading there members Enterprises and EnerBank combined, so you need to split that between those two. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, Tom and so how should we think of that split? Tom Webb :   Okay and EnerBank would be about $0.07 or $0.08 and Enterprises would be about $0.03 or $0.04, it kind of round in there. So Enterprises is running what we call a little low on its earnings contribution today because this is not a great market for the IPPs but what we see-- we have kept ourselves open for the year after next and into the future for capacity contracts, and energy contracts, and if you remember John's presentation from some while ago, we have the opportunity for plants like DIG to be little bit like a Ferrari in a garage. And so that guy can come out when we need to for utility if needed to, if it was the best deal or it can be out there with a higher capacity prices we anticipate will occur over the next couple of three years. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay and EnerBank is that something going on there to add $0.07 to $0.08 again I maybe I just don't recall it contributing that level historically. Tom Webb : No, nothing special just their consistent growth that they have year-over-year, nice performing little bank. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And John, on retail open access and you're thinking there and the prospect that you think that load may come back, how much of that is driven by your outlook for say commodity prices? Are you assuming high commodity prices is what is bringing those customers back or what is the scenario in your mind that you see that as an incremental load opportunity for you? John Russell : I think that let's start now. The load projections really don't do it although I will tell you I think we are going to see more normal capacity prices after some of the EPA rules kick into effect for the Midwest. So that's one area, I really think the driver behind it, Ali, will be legislative changes, I mean really today our customers, we have got about 400 customers on retail open access and our -- the rest of our customers the 98.98% of our customers pay $140 million more per year to take care of those 400 customers, that's not fair. And what we are trying to do as I mentioned earlier is work on some industrial, they are call industrial or heavy energy intense customers to provide them some savings and some discounts which reflect true cost to savings with the type of across the service with the type of plants, the type of customers that they are. So I think say that's going to be the driver. I mean we are out of step in Michigan with having a hybrid market and we are the only one maybe one other state in the country that has this. And the trend is pretty clear, people are moving away from deregulation despite what you saw in Ohio that started before Michigan deregulated, and it was kind of interesting to see the governor talk about what he thinks about that as he's moving forward with it. And while I'm on this little soapbox I think it's pretty important to look around this country and see what happened in March of this year with gas prices, electric prices for those customers that are deregulated and don't have the protection of the utility. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. Got it. Last question. Just to again to frame up that 1,000 megawatt capacity potential that you have for owning. Again could you just remind us what timeframe -- if I heard you right that was beyond the next five years, but it wasn't clear? When do you see that opportunity? Tom Webb : If you look at Slide 16, you can see on we have opportunity to put in another 400 or so megawatts today if the Palisades PPA contract did not renew, it expires in 2022 who knows something can happen earlier there but we are not projecting that. And then the MCV PPA expires in 2025. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc : Good morning. Can we just talk about what happened on the industrial side? Weather-normalized sales were up pretty sharply? Tom Webb :  Yes, what we're seeing and that's why we gave you the slide and showing this sort of the hookups in the building permits and all that sort of thing, we're seeing a turned back up on the industrial site, if you could think back some of you are able to do this to a year ago, we also softening across the country and we were kind of scratching our heads, everybody had ideas for what was causing it. We are seeing a reverse of that in the first quarter of this year. We are seeing things firm up in our particular area there's a couple of customers that are doing particularly well and driving that growth in the first quarter. But we are also seeing a lot of others doing things with their building and preparing for additions, so that's why we're pretty confident with the projections that we have through the rest of the year and we are calling it about the same level of growth. So from an industrial standpoint inside of that 1.7% first quarter growth, it was about 5.8% and we are forecasting and probably continue just a little bit better than 5% for the rest of the year. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc : And just back to Thetford with that current shortfall will you plan currently just to lean on the markets or could we see tight recovery in a couple of years? John Russell : Yes, I think we could Paul. Right now I think the markets are the best way to go for us to fill that shortfall which is small, I mean let's put in perspective, in our peak load is over 8000 megawatt and we are talking about capacity only not really energy for less than 400 megawatts, so it is not a big deal to go the market for 400 megawatts but when we start seeing that increase to near thousand I think in that ramp up we will be looking at Thetford because I think that's kind of a critical stage and we see that and it could change relatively quickly based on the change in retail open access or as Tom said some of the contracts that in the future will move off. So I mean we are very well positioned, the sites ready, the sites ready to go as we said before we've got gas, we've got electric transmission, we've got some older units on site, it's in a remote relatively remote area but it's on the east side of the state near Flint, Michigan and they would really like us to build their plant. So it's a pretty good set up for us. Tom Webb :  So I would just add the purchase we did of the plant in Jackson was at a price that's lower than anything I have seen across the country, and so it was a great thing to do for our customers. The John's point here is that we are going to have to add new capacity for the state as well as our service territory at some point. John Russell :  You bet. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc : Are there other plants out there like the Jackson plant that you could buy? Tom Webb :   There are but there's still, I think three significant IPPs out there, one is ours and so yes there are still opportunities that way too. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc : But either way it's a rate based opportunity? Tom Webb : Yes, it is. John Russell : Absolutely Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levi, Avon Capital Advisor. Please proceed Andy Levi -- Avon Capital Advisor : Hi, good morning. Just two quick questions. Just on the verbiage on the upsize as far as the growth rate so that's what we're talking about, right, upsize to the growth rate? Longer term 5% to 7% right. Tom Webb : Yes, so when you're -- we're talking about the earnings per share growth rate but when we do that you notice we have been cautious each time whether it was upside because we may be conservative on revenue or upside because we maybe a little conservative on our cost or all these different things. That upside we talk about gives us the opportunity and then put more capital investment in place. And then be able to do more work for our customers. So we anticipate certainly in a short-term that this is what kind of gives us chance to give you a very sustainable, very predictable growth at 5% to 7% pace. What we're not trying to signal here is that you are going to see some new sustainable level at a pace higher than that and maybe a year or two when something happens but just our plan is to continue to deliver that 5% to 7% and our point is we probably have some upsides to make that even easier. Andy Levi -- Avon Capital Advisor : Okay, okay. I thought you were talking about upside to the 5% to 7% and again it could be lumpy or there's a year that you surpass the 5% to 7% but when you talked about upside we should just continue to upside to inflexibility I guess? Tom Webb : That well said, thank you. Andy Levi -- Avon Capital Advisor : Okay. And then at the same time some of us are thinking that maybe you may need to file for or may choose to file for a rate case on the electric side that rates would take effect, I don't know mid 2015. So I guess some of this upside could help alleviate or eliminate that potential for 2015 or not at this point? Tom Webb : Well, here is the way I would think about that to put in perspective. For 2014, we didn't need to have a rate case for gas or electric either of those businesses and that's because we found ways to reduce our cost by $150 million that funded if you will the investment. We do plan to do rate cases as we get toward the middle and the end of the year particularly on the electric side. The magnitude of that case will depend upon the size and scale of our O&M cost productions and of course our revenue growth. So we will watch that carefully, we do not anticipate being able to avoid a rate case for an additional year. But it may be able to allow us to tamper the size of the case that we asked for. Andy Levi -- Avon Capital Advisor : Great. And then one last question. Any commentary or information you can give us on the -- I don't know if you want to call it strategy but this thinking as far as we approach the PJM auction what you are thinking there? Tom Webb : Yes, we are not prepared today to announce what we're going to do but you know our opportunity to participate varies to our IPP that we call DIG, Dearborn Industrial Generation. We did participate in the market a year ago for the three year dance period. We are looking at that again but you know PJM is doing I think a good job trying to ensure that the people that participate have hard assets and they plan to be there each and every year. We've got to play that off against what we see the needs are in MISO and make a decision that's the most economic for you as investors, but also the most practical in terms of serving customers in the State of Michigan. So we haven't made that decision yet and I know there are a lot of people out there sharpening their pencils trying to figure out what they will do to be an interesting option. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo, - Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.: Hi, good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered but just curious on the opportunities to reinvest the surplus margins reported in the first quarter. Does that all get reinvested in the second quarter or do you kind of spread it out for the remaining three quarters and how important is summer weather to that reinvestment? Tom Webb : Well, let me start on that and I think both John and I might have some thoughts we would like to share with you to be helpful. We've already started, so I don't want you to think that we have an impact to get a chance to see that on John's Slide 7 which shows the reinvestment curve and he noted that the weather was favorable $0.20 and that we had cost savings that were higher than we expected by another $0.04. So we really had good news of $0.24 in the quarter. You'll note there that we also showed $0.06 of reinvestment and some things that are associated with the cold weather. We always tell you when it's really good news or really bad news, there are things that come with it on the other side. So being very cold, our UAs may creep up a little bit more, our lost gas might be little bit more, so there are some natural offsets. But we've already started the reinvestment in the first quarter, and although we give you a curve that little dotted line, I would caution you not to make that too predictive. We will take on the things that need advanced notice like forestry, tree trimming, we have to plan those things ahead to line up our crews and treat people fairly, and make sure we're doing that in a very safe way, so the earlier we start that the more that we can get done for our customers. We look at outage pull-aheads, those you can't just say I want to do it tomorrow or I want to do it two months from now. So some of those sorts of decisions we can make in this timeframe but than is a lot of other things that can be decided later as we get into the summer and towards the end of the summer and you know hold back on those decisions until we see what mother nature has in store for us over the summer months and if she is favorable again then we have more opportunity, but if she is not and we can't predict that. We only plan on normal weather. We will adjust accordingly so we phase in the reinvestments over time. I don't know John if you want to add anything. John Russell : No, I think it is great response. So, Brian, one thing too, if I understood your question correctly, the reinvestment we started in the first quarter but that's just beginning and as Tom said there is a lot of work to be done to be able to spend the money to get the resources in place to be able to make it effective, so you expect that spend to occur throughout the rest of the year. Operator :  And your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Please proceed. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Hi, how are you? Just wanted to follow up on a few things. I apologize if I misheard them but just on the RPS standards I think you suggested that they might get --that there may be changes to them to make them more aggressive, is that right? John Russell : Well, I just think there will be changes, 2015 as a natural sunset for the law, I don't expect any changes around 2014 but in 2015 I do when I think yes I wouldn't surprised if the targets that we have today which is 10% by 2015 which we will achieve wouldn't be raised or put in context with the energy policy of some sort, so yes I would expect that to happen. And then driver just for you-- the driver is a lot of interest in renewable energy, we like to build renewable energy, the ones that we done, we completed one wind park, we are building another, it is going very well and the costs are coming down, I mean that's the nice thing compared to several years ago when the law was first put into place that wind power was not that competitive, today it's pretty competitive, I mean it is just natural gas is the only one that really beats it in our mind. So the wind regime here is good in Michigan I think we can do some more and would like to build it. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Going back to this issue of the competitive, the shopping and closing that sort of loophole up, I understand the logic behind, I think I understand the logic that you were just discussing with Ali, but what is the political dynamic that might cause that? Because I mean assume that these guys have been getting the subsidy for some time, they probably won't want to see it go away if you follow me so I'm just wondering what leaves the legislature to sort of plug that hole. John Russell : Good question, couple of things. One is the customers these 400 customers -- the main reason to fix it is that it doesn't make sense to have 400 customers subsidized by 1.8 million particularly knowing that some of these 400 customers are not big energy users the way the law work they just happened to get in line earlier back in 2008 and some of them are commercial accounts that prepare fast food, and those really are not driven by energy rates, they are driven more for the success of their business on location, so that's something that really, it's benefiting some customers that quite frankly today probably shouldn't be benefited $440 million a year. The second issue that I think is important here is that there are some people that believe that competition is the right thing to do. I mean regardless of the industry, it is the right thing to do. The message we continue to tell them as they we are pretty unique industry. We are the second highest capital intensive industry in the world. We make electricity, it moves at the speed of light, therefore it's the -- and you can't store it which means it's the most volatile commodity in the world. And I think this winter really proved to a lot of customers that have ventured out in either on the gas side of deregulation or the electric side of deregulation, how volatile that commodity can be, and you seen the lawsuit, you seen claims that people are gouging others and so forth. That's not what this is all about. Our large customers particularly want to have competitive rates and they want predictability and they want certainty. They don't want volatility and bringing them back would allow us to have savings that we could allocate as Tom showed on his slide, may be to that class of customers that uses more energy and ought to have a true cost to service of that approach. So that's that kind of the whole message that's going on today, and I think in the future those customers are probably paying less than buying their electricity from us today. I think in the future -- we have talked about earlier today when you see some of these coal plants retire I'd expect you are going to see that gap narrow quite a bit. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay and then just on the -- Tom Webb : I just go to add one little comment there. It is clear this team, this management team is driven to be competitive whether it's reliability or the prices, rates, bills for our customers, and so the more we succeed on that the less reason there is to have a choice program, so we will be pushing hard for the success of our customers that's the bottom line. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : When do you think that this legislation might be introduced? John Russell : 2015, I expect sometime 2015, as I mentioned that we are hearing that the house about the regulation expanding it beyond 10% so allowing more customers to go to retail open access and the opposition was very strong, is not even getting out of committee, I mean there was no interest in that so it's really I would say 2015 would be the time to look at all of these things, renewable energy, energy efficiency standards, retail open access, maybe some regulatory changes all in about 2015. As I said earlier Paul, I think we have a good opportunity to improve what we have today which think we got a pretty good law here in Michigan today with good regulation. I think there is an opportunity to even it gets better. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. I hear you all that. Let me ask you just on the rate design regulatory on that Slide 14, that's also one of the elements that you want to achieve to get your industrial, rates more in step so to speak. How much money are we talking about there? Or how should we think about that? How does that work? Is that just residential or commercial to pay that or how do we think about that? Tom Webb : Well, look at that slide; I think it is written the three pieces that we show. One is just our cost reductions to the extent that we can keep our cost out of the pace faster than our peers then we can keep our bills and keeps our rates down relatively. The second one is rate design and the whole effort there, there is a workgroup going on led by gentlemen appointed by the governor and he is working with the regulators, the legislature, with our customers, with everybody and what they are seeking to do is simply get rate design, it is a little more like the rest of the Midwest and not so skewed one direction or the other. That will help a lot of these industrial customers and then lastly it is the whole discussion that John just had about the retail open access so I won't repeat that. If those three things were to happen in the scale that we expect they could happen then our industrial customers would be very competitive compared to the rest of the Midwest and remember our residential customers already have competitive bills compared to all the utilities across the nation and which not our goal to push this money around and have somebody paying a lot more and somebody pay a lot less. We just try to get the rate design and structure that we don't have artificial subsidies for some customers over others. So all those things together may -- they are certainly get discussed, they may get acted on in this way through now into 2015, but we can't predict that maybe it will be part of this, may be it will be more than this. But we will see it and we will certainly be an active party in it. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, understood, but just on that second point, the rate design one, is that a generic proceeding or is that going to be part of a rate case? Tom Webb : Well, that's not decided exactly how it will go yet, the study group will make a recommend -- and remembers that study groups got customers and everybody involved in right. They will make a recommendation to the governor. And the governor will share that with the legislature and the legislature may decide to take some action or they may not. This will be completely their choice. If they choose not to on the rate design piece then I think will be a recommendation to the commission to look at this rate design and put something in place and perhaps it could yet be this summer. So that for future rate cases when we file our rate or another utility files rate case, we would be obligated to use that design so putting the rate design and place it first doesn't change your rates until you have a rate case. And then those rate cases will follow that but customers will like that because again John mentioned they don't like volatility, they do like predictability, and if they do know they got something that's coming that's better and it is clear that's very helpful for their own planning. Operator :  And your next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman, Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Yes, good morning. Just curious if any of the Michigan law issues have come up in the governor election process so far or has it been pretty quiet? John Russell : Very quite, haven't been raised at all. Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Okay. Also wanted to ask to the degree that bonus depreciation is extended by Congress how would that impact your financing plan or growth rate if at all? Tom Webb : No real impact to us, I know most utilities would probably answer that question with no, no, no like Amy Winehouse but in our case we are happy to have it because what it does as you are laughing at Amy Winehouse, you don't even know, she is passed away, sure I am (inaudible) I guess, what will happen is that will be good shelter as you know Steve for the utility and that will help us to be more productive and that's good news. But then when we won't have the opportunity to use it as our NOLs up at the parent so they will actually get pushed out further and that's why we are happy. We will take the good news at 95% of our business for our utility customers and have those NOLs shelter us even longer because we won't need to use those near term. And you also know there is the downside. It is off the point that we can push down our parent that quicker though. That's a negative side of all that good news. Operator : At this time, we have no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Russell for closing remarks. John Russell :  All right, thank you. Let me wrap up today's call by saying we are off to strong start in 2014 and working to deliver the 12th year of consistent financial performance. We appreciate everybody's interest in CMS Energy and look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming events. We appreciate your time today and thanks for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.",

This call is being recorded. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at 12 :30 PM Eastern Time, running through July 31. This presentation is also being web cast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Barba, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you. Glenn Barba : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this web cast are available on our web site. This presentation is made as of today, July 24, and contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements should be considered in the context of the risk and other factors detailed in CMS Energy's and Consumer's SEC filings. These factors could cause CMS Energy's and Consumer's results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, when describing CMS Energy's results of operations and financial performance. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix, and posted in the Investors section of our web site. Now, I would like to turn the call over to John. John Russell : Thanks Glenn. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. I will begin the presentation with an overview of the quarter, before I turn the call over to Tom, to discuss the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of 2014. Then we will close with Q&A. In the first half of the year, adjusted earnings were $1.05 a share, that's up $0.22 from last year or 27%. Favorable weather was a big contributor to the first half results, along with cost savings that were implemented last year. The strong first half creates headroom that we will use to reinvest in our operations, focused on safety, reliability and customer satisfaction. As a result of our first half performance and confidence for the remainder of the year, we have raised our low end of our guidance by $0.02 from $1.74 to $1.76. Our top end remains the same at $1.78. As you know, we continue to deliver year-over-year growth based on prior year's actual results without resets. Each year, we have achieved or exceeded the top end of our guidance. This year, we are continuing to move in that direction. The low end of our guidance is now higher than the midpoint of our original guidance. Our updated guidance raises this year's EPS growth in the range of 6% to 7%, with our long term guidance remaining at 5% to 7%. The Michigan Energy Law passed in 2008 is working well. However, we see an opportunity to update and improve it in 2015. The governor has already proposed a set of no regrets principles, which we support. In June, Governor Snyder signed into law, a bill that will ensure Michigan's energy rates accurately reflect the cost of service for all customers. The Governor is focused on making Michigan competitive, and a part of that is having competitive industrial rates. The new rate design is a first key step. The Senate Energy Committee has convened a work group, in which we are participating to review Michigan's Energy Efficiency and renewable energy policies. It's likely the Group's recommendations will become part of energy legislation in 2015. Michigan's Governor Rick Snyder is being challenged by Mark Schauer. Key issues involve education, creating more jobs, improving the roads, and resolving the remaining legacy issues of Detroit. Energy is not an issue. As both candidates meet in the middle on energy policy. Both favor an increase in renewable standard, a continuation of energy efficiency, along with competitive rates. We know both candidates very well, and we will work with either to continue to improve Michigan's economy. The states economy continues to perform well. Now in its fifth year of recovery, various national surveys have placed Michigan in the top 10. The state is striving to achieve top 10 status in all categories, and is well positioned to achieve that. One of the last remaining legacy issues is the city of Detroit bankruptcy. On July 21, Detroit pensioners voted to accept pension cuts and reduced healthcare benefits. This is a major step for the city to exit bankruptcy. Our company has joined other Michigan corporations in this historic initiative, to improve Detroit's economic recovery. On the west side of the state, in our largest electric market, Grand Rapids leads the way in economic growth. Not only in Michigan, but as a top ranked city in all of the United States. The city's economic performance ranks among the best in the nation. A recent Manpower Employment Survey found Grand Rapids has the best labor market in the nation. The survey results show that 32% of businesses intend to increase staffing during the third quarter. This compares to 29% in Michigan and 22% in the United States. We are fortunate to serve this growing city. Since the EPA Carbon rules released, we have been studying them closely. We will be coordinating with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and continuing our analysis. At this time, we appear to be in good position to meet the future targets. But the devil is in the details. Our plan is to move to a cleaner and a more balanced generation portfolio, featuring a greater share of renewable energy and combined cycle natural gas generation. Now I will turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Webb : Thanks John. We deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for joining us on the call today. Thank you. As John mentioned, our second quarter results at $0.30 a share were up a penny from last year, and the first half results at $1.05 were up $0.22 or 27%. As you can see here, we already have put to work some of the substantial upside from the first quarter, with the reinvestments in even more productivity and reliability in the second quarter. As shown with the yellow arrow, we have got plans to put more to work during the rest of the year, and that's without jeopardizing our ability to deliver earnings growth at 6% to 7% this year. As you can see in the dotted circle, our substantial cost savings in the second half fully fund planned capital investments. This shows the important work we have completed to self-fund all of our capital investment in 2014. Now this slide is familiar to many of you, this shows how we continue to reduce our cost levels and reinvest good performance from the first quarter. The O&M reinvestment improves reliability, generates incremental productivity and it pre-funds parent debt, and this last point maintains our conservative risk profile. Looking ahead to 2015, here is a summary of our recently filed gas rate case for implementation in 2015. Over the past three years, we have reduced our customer bills by almost 10%, that's over 3% a year. With this case, we are requesting recovery of capital investment, partially offset by substantial cost reductions. We are also requesting an investment recovery mechanism to improve the process, for approving and monitoring capital investment, and that's the main reason for our rate cases. Still with an eye on the future, our small business outside of the utility provides meaningful upside. As most of you know, we plan to layer in long term capacity contracts at our IPP in Dearborn, as capacity prices rise. We have seen by lateral contracts, already in excess of $3 a kilowatt month. This adds to our confidence, that prices in the $4.50 and $7.50 range may be likely. This would provide an upside of almost $30 million to $50 million, and that's about full year's level of profit improvement for the company. On the energy side, we recently completed a long term contract for one of our combined cycle units at over $4 a kilowatt month. This is encouraging, it\u2019s a great sign of value of our IPP or John calls it, the Ferrari in the garage over in Dearborn. On the sales front, we are encouraged by industrial growth. 2014 sales are up 8% compared to last year, and we have raised our growth forecast for total electric sales to 2.5%. You may remember the number was 1.7% in our last call. For example, you may also have read about an announcement just this week from the Italian brake manufacturer Brembo. They are adding 27 megawatts of load to support a new foundry in our service territory. Great new business. We continue however to maintain a conservative outlook for the future growth, we plan on sales growth of about 0.5% a year. Our philosophy has not changed. We'd rather make conservative assumptions regarding our future, so that surprise our good news, good news for our customers, and good news for you, our investors. We take the same approach on cost control. While our actual cost performance is at the strong end of peers, we continue to plan conservatively for the future. As shown on the right box of this slide, cost reductions were 3% last year, and before the substantial reinvestment, down 8%. We forecast that costs will be down another 2% this year. We have upped our reinvestment another penny, because of all the great weather in the first quarter, but made no change to the 8% reduction for this year. For the future, we plan conservatively at a net reduction of about 2%. You can see two examples of how this is accomplished on the right side of this slide. A 2% annual reduction over the next five years is equal to about $100 million reduction in O&M. The plans to replace retired coal plants with gas generation and renewables, combined with changes already in place to our benefit programs, will save $100 million over the next five years. Add on other plant productivity around automated meters, improved field mobility and first time quality and we have plenty of room to fund new programs and still meet our net cost reduction. We are planning conservatively, but we consider this to be an important element of our program to improve customer bills and customer service. I am sure many of you noted that earlier this week, we closed on a securitization of the coal plants that were retiring in 2016. We were pleased with the investor interest in these AAA rated bonds and the benefits that this will bring to our customers. Saving our electric customers $22 million in the first full year, and more than $100 million overall. We will use these proceeds to pay down debt and equity, and it will provide capacity for us to invest more in needed gas infrastructure projects. This is a real win-win for our customers and our investors. The productivity steps that we have been taking have permitted us to self-fund rate cases and improve our customer's relative price position as shown on this slide. While our electric residential bills already are competitive, we have much more work to do for our industrial customers. The legislature has provided direction to the commission to enhance rate designs, and coupled with our own cost reductions that self-funded rate cases, these could improve our industrial rates by about 8%. Should policymakers choose to phase out the existing retail open access program, there could be another $150 million available to improve rates further. These steps can put us into a fully competitive position in a very short period of time. Looking further into the future, this is another slide that is familiar to many of you. The need for investment over the next 10 years has grown to over $20 billion as shown in the blue circle on the right. Those needs are up from what we expected only a year or two ago. Our plans however, only include investment of about $15 billion, limited only by our desire to keep our base rate increases below inflation. Some of the major investments that we do not yet have in our plan, include new capacity for PPA replacements, the potential return of ROA customers, and as MISO puts it, a substantial capacity shortfall in zone seven of 2000 megawatts by 2016, when coal plants are expected to be retired. Here is the good news; some of these capacity replacements and upgrades provide an opportunity to reduce customer bills. This puts us in the enviable position of meeting reliability needs for our customers and maintaining fully competitive rates and bills, while also providing a nice opportunity for incremental growth. I wouldn't be surprised, if a year from now, we are talking to you about an investment plan of $16 billion to $17 billion, rather than the $15 billion, and without hurting price competitiveness for our customers. Here is a slide from MISO showing their anticipated shortfall in zone seven of 2 gigawatts. And here is a slide that shows how large the capacity needs would be, should ROA customers return to bundled service, either naturally or by policy, as well as the magnitude of capacity needed to replace PPAs. These opportunities alone require about 3,000 megawatts of new capacity at Consumers, needing our share of the MISO zone seven shortfall could be on top of that. None of this is in our present plan. So coming back to today, we are pleased to share our sensitivity chart, so that you can see the impact of changes to sales, gas prices, ROE and interest rates in 2014. And here is our regular report card for 2014 financial targets; we are on target to meet all of these goals. But I want to caution you, that with the need to rebuild fuel inventories that were depleted last year, our operating cash flow target may be at some risk at this point; and this is a temporary issue, it will be fully recovered by 2015. So here is our overall look at earnings and dividend growth, showing our mindset around consistent good performance at the high end of peers for our customers, without jeopardizing our consistent high end performance for investors. We are proud of the track record humbled by our interest in committed to continuing improvements every day. So thank you once more for taking time to listen to our call today. John and I would be pleased to answer your questions. So Lisa, would you please open the call for those questions? Operator : Certainly. Thank you very much Mr. Webb. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of Daniel Eggers of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse : Hey, good morning guys. Thomas Webb : Good morning Dan. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse : Tom, following up on your last comment, kind of the $15 billion, prospectively turning into $16 billion or $17 billion, what do you see as progression, when you guys get comfortable, or think about moving some of these projected generation projects into real spending dollars into capital plants, given the time to develop and implement that kind of capital? Thomas Webb : Let me start, if I may on that question; because I sort of see a pattern that I have shared, I know, many times with folks where we have got a lot of work to do first, to get our prices competitive, and what we are doing avoiding rate cases and what a big working group is doing across all our customers, and legislature and regulators and the like to try to get a rate design in place, can help us get that done, that's first. Then clearly, we need to get to the elections. And then third, we need the opportunity to have the law updated, and that's going to include a lot of things; energy efficiency, renewables, those are going to impact how we respond to the EPA guidelines. There is a lot going on there, including the retail open access position. Personally, I am a believer that, that's going to correct itself naturally or by policy or by a combination of both. When we get through those three, then I see us starting more aggressively, trying to figure out how to bring the needed incremental capacity into Michigan. Michigan has a need, we have a need. And we are happy to respond to that, after we get through those steps. So that's why I said, it's my own personal belief, its probably a year from now, when we tell you that that $15 billion, and candidly, you all know, we are at about $15.5 billion, we are just conservative with how we describe it. When we see that may be going to $16 billion or $17 billion, because we will need to put some of that capacity in place, we show on slide 20, where we talk about new generation needed that's in the 20, not in the 15. We see that occurring, and we think we can do all of that without hurting the price competitiveness, that we think is the magic that makes a win-win. So I apologize for the long-winded answer, but that's sort of the flow that I think, and that's why I think its about a year from now, when you will see those numbers start to grow. And I don't know John, if you want to add? John Russell : I agree. I think that's the right thing. Dan, I wouldn't put it in the book yet, but as Tom said, really 2015 -- by the end of 2015, we expect to have the law resolved and the opportunities here, just to give you a little bit of an idea for our conservative nature. But still, it doesn't change our growth plan, which performance and guidance, which for the forecast, is again, 5% to 7%. So there is opportunities here to give us confidence that we continue to hit that 5% to 7%. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse : Thank you for clarifying that. And I guess the other question, when you look at the breakdown of weather normalized load growth by customer class of these industrials, [indiscernible] stabilize. In residential, you have had these -- there is still these down comps. Can you just shed a little more color on what you're seeing by customer class, and how you expect those customers behave, to support the 0.5% growth you guys are looking at, beyond this year? Thomas Webb : That's good question. I would tell you that we still see for the year, residential and commercial sales to be about flat; and we are beginning to see lots of signs of new hook-ups. Lots of green chutes, whatever people like to call that, which are very positive, but we are unwilling to put that in our forecast. We still think, things are soft enough, so those are sort of flat. So what's driving the growth, as it typically does first, is the industrial side. And today we told you that, we have seen an average increase of a little over 8% on the industrial side, and we are forecasting for the year, by the way about that. You may not recall. In the first quarter, we are up 5.8% on the industrial side. In the second quarter, we are up 10.6% for that average about 8% now. Now grant you, there are few people who are really driving that. There is a particular customer, who is just having a lot of success, and we are not permitted to single their name out, if you don't mind. And that's helping us a lot. But on the industrial side, we really do see good promise, where weather adjusted on the industrial side, we see the strong numbers I talked about. There is still underlying growth without that good customer, that's really nice and positive in the second quarter, when I would have called it closer to flat in the first quarter. So it's pretty good. Now remember, I gave an example in the presentation about a company called Brembo, they are an Italian brake maker. They make premium brakes. They are a highly regarded manufacturer around the globe, and they have chosen to put more of their business into Michigan, which we are delighted, and with the foundry they are talking about, that's a pretty big load for us. So we are seeing a lot more of that. There are things we can't talk about, that I look forward to unfolding in the next call or the call after that. The signs are pretty nice. John did a nice job describing how in our service territory, the physicals in Grand Rapids and in the western part of Michigan continue to be really good, and hopefully, there is going to be a nice turnaround on the east side of the state too. Does that help Dan? Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse : That was great. Thank you guys. Operator : Thanks very much for your question. Our next question is from the line of Greg Gordon of ISI Group. Please go ahead. Thank you. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Thanks. Good morning gentlemen. John Russell : Good morning. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : I got a couple of questions. One, just to follow-up quickly on that -- Dan's question on demand. I mean, the weather adjusted electric deliveries, including Retail Open Access, year-to-date are up 2.3%, right, six months ended, which is above your base case long term forecast? And obviously, that's been driven by industrial predominantly. Do you think that industrial base is stable and that you can continue to grow off that base? And then if that's true and you see improvement in residential and commercial on top of that, wouldn\u2019t your -- 0.5% base case become conservative? Thomas Webb : Greg it\u2019s a great question, and I am going to give you a yes and no. In 2014, yes, we are seeing a nice recovery, the weather adjusted number for June year-to-date is 2.3% and you can tell by the numbers we give you, that its driven by that over 8% industrial. We are already seeing signs, as we begin the third quarter, that's going to continue. So that's why we have upped our forecast from 1.7% for overall weather adjusted electric sales for the full year. We have gone to 2.5 from 1.7, and we feel good about that. We think that's in the right ballpark, and give us a tenth or two, we never get that part right. But we are not willing to encourage people in the future years, to plan on big load growth as what drives our earnings, because it doesn't, and we'd rather tell you, we want to be conservative, and we expect that growth to be as good as maybe 0.5%, and that's where we would like to be. It turns out, all the things that are happening makes that better. I think that's good for you, and that's great for us, and its wonderful for our customers, because it spreads the rate base across more of our customers. So I hope you work with us. We plan to be conservative in our forecast beyond 2014, and we are trying to give you the most accurate look we know how to do in 2014. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Well that was exactly where I was going, the higher load growth forecast doesn't necessarily jack your rate base investment in and of itself, but allows you to spread your costs over a wider base and better control costs? Thomas Webb : Exactly. Well I am sorry, your point is right. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : The second question I had was, can you -- much in the same way you talked about the timing and pacing of revising your expectations on capital expenditures, can you talk about how soon that Ferrari starts [indiscernible] out of the garage? Or to put it in English, the $30 million to $50 million of potential upside from your merchant power business, what are the milestones and timing that that would cause you to be able to sort of execute that and bring it to the bottom line? Thomas Webb : So let me correct myself and call it a Mustang GT out of the rouge area. John Russell : Greg says to put it in English. I heard that Greg, that hurt. Thomas Webb : So here is what we are seeing; we talked to you about the opportunities on the capacity side, because that's where the big opportunities are. Its going to roll out, as soon as capacity prices start to recover, and we believe we are going to see capacity prices in our zone, in MISO, start to move up in the next year and two; but we are already seeing it in bilateral contracts. In fact, that's why we are encouraged by some of numbers I told you, like $3 already, if we wanted to lock it in on the capacity side. So I suspect, and I may be a little conservative, that that good news doesn't roll in this year, it rolls in next year and the year after. And our strategy, is not to be greedy, grab whatever we can get right away, or not to be greedy and wait until it gets to 7.50, and it never gets there. Our strategy is just to be prudent, and as we see some in the nice zone of -- don't hold to be a number, but a better number. We will put part of that in place for one of the combined cycles. And then we will put a little more in place, if the numbers get better. So we will like average our way in to some pretty nice numbers. So to your point, I think its going to be over the next couple, may be two years, and don't forget the energy side too. We are seeing -- we saw a nice uptick when we entered into this new contract at over $4, and then we saw energy rates come right back. So again, you can see, we are just waiting for the right opportunities, trying to be patient. And we can't tell you the day, the month, or even the year, but we know we are protected on the low side, so we are going to be opportunistic on the high side. Bottom line, I'd say over the next couple, maybe three years, you will see this sort of feather in, and I don't mean to mislead you saying, you are going to see a whole year's growth in the same year. John Russell : Greg, I'd just add too; is that, it's really a compliment to our business. It's not our core. We focus on Consumers Energy, but we just wanted investors to know. Its there. There is opportunity, but as Tom said, we don't really count that. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : And it's not really baked into your earnings growth forecast? Thomas Webb : The capacity is not, part of the energy is. Greg Gordon - ISI Group : Got you. Thank you guys. Thomas Webb : Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead, thank you. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thank you. Good morning. Thomas Webb : Good morning. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Tom, just remind us; that sensitivity that you gave us, 1% change in electric sales is about $0.05 in annual earnings for the company. Can you remind us, how that changes depending on the customer class, so if that 1% is coming from industrial, versus CNI. Would it still stay the same, or how should we be thinking about that sensitivity, based on the customer class? Thomas Webb : I would obviously tell you that, it's the residential side where the bulk of our business is. And so, we are more sensitive to that movement, as it goes up. So if there is a restoration of growth there, its going to give us more impact than on the industrial side, where we try to provide the kind of competitive rates for our big users. That doesn't make us a pile of money but sure brings more business. So I think that's what you had in mind, and that is the right way to think about it. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Right. Okay, got it. And then second, in this gas rate case, you have asked for a full decoupling, as well as this investment rate mechanism. Can you share with us, what kind of receptivity overall you're seeing on the state for those kinds of mechanisms? Thomas Webb : So on the decoupling, I'd like to fashion that as a part of the overall update to the law. Now I am going to give you an opinion, so anybody listening in could have a different view, but on that issue, I think there is going to be pretty good receptivity to decoupling for energy efficiency as you call it, energy optimization as we call it. But who knows, on this economic side, and on the sales side. I think that's up for grabs in a good dialog and discussion, and we are not hard headed about that. We want to do what the overall group of people, whether it\u2019s the legislature, the regulators or customers and people think make sense. We are happy to pass back good news and bad news right away through decoupling, but it may only be energy efficiency. That's just a personal opinion. So now when you come to things like mechanisms for recovering investment, they make perfect sense to us, because they provide the regulatory team, the staff, the commission, even more insight to approving our capital investments, and even more insight to tracking how we are doing, and full authority, if we change what we are doing or we don't spend the right amount, up or down whatever to impact that, in a good governance way. We think this is a great way to go forward, but I think there are a lot of different opinions. So people have to think through it. Are the customers better off with this mechanism; and I believe they are, and if people come to that understanding, then I think the need for rate cases will dissipate quite a bit, and you will see us, if we had a full mechanism on our capital investment. I think what you would see, that we would come in may be every three years or so, because we will need to come back, just to true-up, maybe on revenue and the pass-through cost reductions. But we wouldn't need to come back as often. So those are up for grabs. That's part of the healthy discussion that's already underway and work group's over at the legislature, as well as the commission who will make some decisions that are very important around that in our rate cases. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Got it. And last question, given you only modestly raised the bottom end of your forecast for the year. But conceptually, as you're looking at the year, just to get a sense of what has improved? I know you've raised your weather normalized sales forecast. Are thinking you're going to maybe spend less O&M maybe in the second half than budgeted? Is it the electric sales that are running better? Overall, what would you attribute the improvement versus say your original expectations? John Russell : The biggest change for us, the first year -- or the first part of the year, the weather was very good. The first quarter of the year, and the gas business. And one of the things I mentioned briefly is some of the aggressive cost measures, cost reductions that we have taken over the past several years, continue to pay dividends year-over-year, and those are things like some of our legacy costs eliminated, and that was going forward and so forth. So we are seeing a nice combination of a top-end growth, with the cold weather, we are able to reinvest and also the middle line growth or reduction if you will of costs. So those are the two drivers, while we are in the position we are. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Got it. Thanks John. Thank you. John Russell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Thank you. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Good morning. Thomas Webb : Good morning Paul. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: With the securitization, you talked about paying down debt and equity at Consumers, how does that flow through to the parent? Thomas Webb : Good question. Please do think about it just the way you said it. We take those proceeds to pay to offset equity and debt at the utility, and then we take those proceeds that come out of that, and we are able to put them to work, the cash part of that, to work in the gas side of the business. Now typically, when you see a securitization at a utility, its good news for customers, but you lose rate base. While this is good news for our electric customers, because we will reduce their rates, and remember, that's where we have to help, be more competitive. But then the extra capital resources that come out of that, we have got a big need on the gas side of our business. The gas side of our business is growing exponentially, its becoming a bigger part of our company every day. So this gives us another $370 million that we can put into that gas business, and of course, the rate base goes up there and you get earnings on it, but we are really doing because we need it, we have got a lot of work to do there. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Thank you. And secondly, this cost of removal benefit, how long does that last and what's the trajectory of that savings? Thomas Webb : Okay, it varies by business, so it goes between five and a dozen years, and it\u2019s a benefit where you will see us, our taxes improve, because we have accelerated the -- what is a tax benefit we would have gotten over 20 and 30 years into that five and 12-year period. So its five years for electric and 12 years for gas, and that's just -- the main reason we did it, if you didn't recall, was to improve rates for our customers, to help avoid these rate cases in 2014. That's a beautiful benefit t pour through, and it doesn't damage at all the efforts we have to deliver 5% to 7% growth in the future. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: How is that 211 split between gas and electric? Thomas Webb : So the electric is 211 and gas is 264. So the annual numbers, if it makes sense when I do the five and 12 for you, $42 million at electric and $22 million annually at gas. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: And year-to-date, about 34% tax rate, where do you see that full year and kind of the next few years, if you want to go out that far? Thomas Webb : That's good for this year, because its that cost of removal benefit, that's what you are seeing. And that will help sustain that level for a couple of years. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for your question. And our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Thank you. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : Good morning. Thomas Webb : Good morning. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : Not to go over sales growth too much, but I am afraid I am a little confused just in general by the trajectory. On industrial, it looks to me, that last year, there was a substantial decrease; so if you could pare over 2012, I don't see that strong a growth; and I guess what I am trying to understand is, what has changed here? I mean, you guys feel more comfortable with the industrial growth, because of the people who are coming to your service territory and what have you? That's the first question, I guess? Thomas Webb : I think, let's step back and take a big picture first. We see the industrial growth having improved substantially since the recession, and we are way back to pre-recession levels, and we see that continuing to occur. So the underlying growth is good, its sound, we are comfortable, it should flow through. In fact, we are seeing things we can't talk about today, that's going to add to that growth in the future. But, let me go to a second level down, little deeper down in. We do have an anomaly, that you were observing. Last year, we had a customer that got hurt; and so you saw a little fall off in the industrial side or their share of that. This year, they are fully rebounded, they are doing great, they had a bump in the road, and that is making our numbers even bigger for this year compared to last year. So you are right in your observation of that. But now keep in mind for the full year, we see ourselves with all classes, weather adjusted at a 2.5% growth. But we are telling you beyond that, we think the right thing to count on, is something more like a 0.5% growth and maybe we are under calling it, but we are assuming that on the residential side and the commercial side, nothing is going to come up, but we might be wrong, because the hook-ups are increasing this year, but we are assuming not, and we are assuming that underlying growth on the industrial side, not that special one going up and down, will continue. And that's why we are pretty comfortable with that 0.5%. Again, I hope we are wrong on the downside. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : Okay, I hear you. Just to sort of focus on that customer growth, could you give us a sense as to what the customer growth was, and how that compares to, what I see, I guess, as a negative 0.6% for residential and 0.3% for commercial. How do we compare the two and how do you see that changing to make these do better than what we have seen year-to-date? Thomas Webb : So I don't have my old data page in front of me, and I apologize for that, but I will tell you this, if you looked at the recession, our industrial fall-off was about a point less than where the rest of the country was; and then if you look at the recovery, our industrial improvement was about a point better than where the rest of the country was, and I see that, as your best long term indicator of growth; because I see the residential and then the commercial sides following that. Now there is one other factor to consider, when you are thinking about the economy. For the last three years, whatever number we give you, includes about 1% of energy efficiency across the board; residential, commercial and industrial. So that dampens our numbers. So if we were to tell you, unless this year 2.5% growth. The underlying growth is 3.5%, but energy efficiencies bring that down to 2.5%. And its one of the reasons we want to stay conservative in the future, is because we plan to be able to deliver a full point of energy efficiency every year, that's good for our customers, and we think that's good for the business, it fits our model well, and that's why we go over to the 0.5%. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : I understand. I guess I understand what you're saying, particularly on the industrial; but just, moving over though to the residential, I guess what I am missing at, sorry to be so slow on this, why the negative sales growth for the last six months if things are doing better, I guess? Do you follow what I am saying? Thomas Webb : I do, I do, I do. So really we don't have negative, let me take you through that point again, let's use the precise numbers. For June year-to-date, residential is down 0.6%. So that really means, its up 0.5% before energy efficiencies. So we are seeing the hook-ups, we are seeing the growth in our economy and in our customers, and then we are helping them be more efficient, so you see the negative number. What I also think is, the residential and commercial side, we are going to tell you, we think are going to stay in that flat zone, little negative, little negative flat right, we can't predict that well. But I think we are probably be wrong, I think they will follow industrial as you go through time, and you will see some uptick. That's opinion in the last part, and the first part was fact. John Russell : Paul, this is John. One thing I tell legislators, the way I describe energy efficiency, as Tom did analytically. I mean generally in the industry, 1% reduction in growth or energy efficiency is 100% of our load growth, and I think people that like energy efficiency which we do, talk about it in terms of percent, 1% or 2%, but that's how significant energy efficiency is, and it maybe an industry thing in those states that are pushing energy efficiency; where we are growing, we are growing with energy efficiency included in those numbers, as Tom showed you. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : Okay. Let me just finally sort of ask you about the renewables that are being discussed in the state. And I know you guys are concerned about customer rates, and I am just wondering, how you communicate the message as to -- I guess, what's your expected impact of increased renewable requirements will be on rates, and whether that's fully understood in the politic, if you know what I am saying? John Russell : Yeah I do. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : And I am just wondering if you could sort of just lay out a little bit for us about how you are proceeding with that, when people get enthusiastic about renewables? John Russell : Absolutely, if renewables need to be part of a balanced portfolio, we need baseload. I want to increase renewables, renewable increase also needs to be looked at fairly, with the cost of renewables. We have some pretty good wind regimes here and our wind turbines are doing pretty well. On a scale basis, they are probably with the tax credits they are, second only to natural gas generation. So on scale, I think there is potential here in Michigan to move forward. The thing that we are pretty clear about though, is when you get into distributed generation in some of the subsidies that are required to make that work, it doesn't make a lot of sense for customers, they are working to trying to reduce rates. And part of it is, we are worried about all of our 1.8 million electric customers, not just the few that may be subsidized for certain things. So in other words, what we want to make sure is that, whatever we move forward with, renewable energy, its best for all of our customers, not just a few. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates : Okay, great. Thanks so much. John Russell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Good morning guys. John Russell : Good morning. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Just one, I just wanted to go back on sales, in that conversation with Paul occurred to me. The 0.5%, is that before or after energy efficiency? Thomas Webb : That includes energy efficiency, so the 0.5%, the way we see the math, would actually be 1.5%. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Okay, great. Thank you, Tom. The real question was going to be, on timing of the next electric rate case, and the rate design issue. I don't recall exactly the details, but there were some issues in that order around how -- when it would be implemented. Can you give us your sort of latest thoughts on how that may play out for you, and the timing of the next case, etcetera? Thomas Webb : So there is three things driving the next electric rate case. One is just the normal electric case. This year for 2014, we fully offset all the capital with O&M cost reductions. Next year, we are going to offset a lot of it, but not all of it. So we need a rate case. Whether its December, January, its not so critical, but we need one. Second thing is, remember we bought the Jackson plant, and we had an agreement with the seller, that we would close on that, late in 2015, and therefore we wanted to push off, when we got the approval from our commission to December of 2015. And so that all neatly goes together, that's the second reason. The third reason that we are very likely to go in December, is because we have a new rate design, and the commission now has the direction from the legislature on moving on some better cost of service oriented rate design, and for customers to benefit from that, they need to have a rate case to put it in place. We have a few customers that do benefit from some attractive rate designs that expire in January in 2016. So they are keen to make sure that there is an order out in 2015, that supports the new rate design, that they are very happy with. So we have got three pressure points since the first time in my career, I can remember people banging on me to please do a rate case as soon as you can. So it\u2019s a little different approach, but we actually think; we want to put it off as long as we can, we don't need it for Jackson until December 2015. We don't need it for the new rate design until the end of 2015, and we really don't need the extra revenue relieved until the self implementation in the middle of 2015. So I think December-ish will probably be our approximate time of filing for those reasons. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : December of this year? Thomas Webb : Yes. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Great. Thank you, Tom. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Andy Levi of Avon Capital Advisors. Please go ahead. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital Advisors : Hi, good morning. John Russell : Good morning. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital Advisors : Just a quick question; I think I have asked it before, I am just not sure if the answer is the same. So you have several incremental positives, longer term, whether its big plant, possibly sales growth, higher CapEx. At some point, is it possible that the growth rate goes up, or do you kind of just manage within that 5% to 7% and continue to allow the rate payers to benefit from the upside, even if it\u2019s the big plants? John Russell : I like the plan we have. Let me state a little bit differently. We have continued to grow at -- give the guidance at 5% to 7%. For the last several years, we have exceeded the midpoint and gone to the top end of that. That is the plan that we have going forward. We have plenty of investment to make, we are worried about customers and investors. For our investors, the important thing I'd say there is, we tend to perform consistently year-over-year without resets, a couple of hundred basis points better than our peers. So the steady predictable outcome, with a dividend increase that grows with that, is really what we are trying to do. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital Advisors : So let's just talk about the big plant. If you were to be able to achieve the top end of the capacity upside, which, let's call an incremental $0.10, $0.12, and let's say, it could be layered in over three years, so $0.03, $0.04 a year, and then obviously, your utilities -- your utility, that wouldn't add to that 5% to 7%? John Russell : It would certainly add to the mix. The thing that I would look at there, is that it would take risk out of our opportunity to achieve our long term guidance. It may actually enable us to avoid a rate case. I mean, there is things that we can do with that, to reinvest it, to continue to achieve that piece. I mean, I just want to make sure everybody understands, we really take seriously, doing what we say we do. And whether its weather upside, weather hurt, it doesn't matter to us. We continue to achieve what we say we are going to do year-over-year. And that's the mindset we have here, which I think is important and I think its something that investors need to do. I think we are unique in the industry, that we reinvest favorable weather, and I tell our Board this, that's not easy to do, because we are a pretty capital intensive industry, and to move things around within the year is difficult to do. Yeah, I'd say right now, I'd continue to look at that 5% to 7%. I mean, as we illustrate some things in the future, some capital -- additional capital investments and so forth, it just positions us with higher confidence to achieve that outcome year-over-year. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital Advisors : So just to make sure I understand what you're saying, any upside from the non-regulated business, for no better way, whether EnerBank or DIG will kind of be used to help the rate pare, which is a good thing. But that's kind of what you're saying? John Russell : Yeah, exact -- to our customers, absolutely. I mean, our customers may see the benefit from that by additional investment in the utility, through some of the -- what we received at CMS. Thomas Webb : And all of that increases the probability of performing at the high end year after year after year after year. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital Advisors : Got it. Thank you very much guys. John Russell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. Thank you. Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann : Hi, good morning. John Russell : Good morning Brian. Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann : Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just on the investment recovery mechanism, in the gas rate case, can you may be just talk about the mechanics of that, and how that would be implemented and allow you to avoid annual rate cases? Thomas Webb : I wouldn't worry too much about the mechanics candidly. They are really this simple, is that we make a request for the 2015 test year, and that would be addressed in the rate case, and then we'd have this request regarding 2016 and 2017, which would be acknowledged and implemented in 2016 and then in 2017. So we get the three years of capital spending clarified and agreed to, and then the rates that would come along with it, would come along each year, so not in advance. They would come along as you need it for the year 2016, and then as you need it for the year 2017. And the reason I say, I wouldn't get too much into the mechanisms that we have requested, we are very flexible. It\u2019s the concept we think is a really good one, and we are very anxious to work with the staff and with our customers, and all parties involved to first make sure that they see how much sense it makes for them as customers, and then the mechanism is put in place that works for everybody. So we are flexible on that, we just like the concept, and I think there are a few people who really do embrace the concept. Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay, understood. And then the second half 2014 drivers noted on slide 11, how is that dispersed over the third and fourth quarter? Thomas Webb : We got three different pieces, the cost savings are in there already, so they are kind of automated. The $0.11 that you see on that slide, and the capital investment, the 9 to 11, most of that is already automated, so I think of that as smoothly coming in, or evenly over the quarters. It\u2019s the reinvestment part that we get to tailor a little bit, so that $0.12, we will -- I don't want to say that will be perfectly smooth, we are chickens. We will put in as much of that as we can in the third quarter without taking and risking the financial performance for the year. So we will leave some flexibility. We will take things that we know, if you don't do them early, you can't get them done, more tree trimming, we'd love to do that. We will do that early. But we will make other decisions, like the potential contribution we might make to a foundation or to low income funds. We will make that call more toward the end of the period, to ensure that we are maximizing the benefits to everybody involved, without missing our commitments we have to you. So I'd say the bar on reinvestment can move a little bit, it will move with -- do we end up with a hot summer or a cold summer, so it will flex with those things, but the cost savings of $0.11 and the reinvestment and other of $0.09 to $0.11, those are pretty smooth, those are on autopilot. Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay, great. And then any initial thoughts on July weather in your service territory? Thomas Webb : Yeah it was a little cool the first couple of days, and I would just tell you that, there is a few pennies there that we have already factored into our forecasting, and I know you don't get to see that, and I apologize for that, but I am glad to tell everybody. We saw a little cooler weather in July, and our forecast is that there will be some hot and some cool, still yet in the rest of July. So we think there is a few pennies of bad news in there, nothing that bothers us in any great way, causes us to dramatically change our plans. But we will be watching August carefully, and depending on which way that goes, that's why we will tailor that reinvestment of that $0.12 a little bit, based on what comes out of there, and that's why it\u2019s a little hard for me to honestly tell you exactly how much of that will occur or won't occur. It depends on weather and other things going on. Does that help? Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann : Yes it does. Thank you very much. Thomas Webb : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Hi guys. John Russell : Hi Steve. Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Might be your longest call ever. Just a couple of specific questions; the new DIG contract that you announced here, can you disclose who that's with? Thomas Webb : No. I might be able to, but I am going to be safe and not risk that. I don't think they would want to be advertised anyhow. I would just tell you, its with a very good counterparty that you would be really comfortable with. Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Okay. And then on -- you discussed the kind of idea that, over the next year we might have visibility on, I guess as much as a couple of billion more investment? It seems like a lot of that might be generation or renewables, should we view that as a decent chance that could come back into the mix? John Russell : Let me talk about that, I think as Tom said, there is opportunity here. Let's wait till the law, the new law I guess comes out in 2015. I'd say yeah, most of it would be in the generation side, whether its increasing renewable energy. Whether its -- somehow we are buying capacity, obviously now we are doing at the end of 2015, with the gas plant we are picking up. We may need to do some additional capacity upgrades at some of our plants, which is incremental, and you know this Steve, but for everybody. We tend to also, with our capital investments, try to avoid the big bets. I mean, we try not to bet the farm and build massive plants. The [indiscernible] plant is something that we have delayed. Although the permits are still active, and we will probably hold on to those permits as long as we possibly can. I think the [indiscernible] plant has potential in the future, and as Tom said in his part of the presentation today, If zone seven, which is the lower peninsula of Michigan, is short by 2,000 megawatts. I mean, the way I tell politicians that, is that's a nuclear plant, that's two coal plants, that's three or four gas plants. And that shortage is predicted in 2016. So I think there will be new capacity needed, and as -- we are the best one to do it, and to save rights for our customers, we will make it happen. Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Just one more question related to that, when you think about the Zone seven in MISO, because of the constraints in Michigan, does that generation for the most part, really need to come from within Michigan, or can you buy from other zones within MISO. John Russell : That's a great question. I'd say generally -- for general purposes, think about it, it has to be here in Michigan. And the reason is, we are on a peninsula, and there is limited capacity, transmission capacity in to and out of the state. And so there maybe some of it, with firm transmission that's outside of the state, that can get in here. But if you remember way back, in the 2000 Energy Law, when that went through, we increased the capacity come into the state, I think to 5,000 megawatts, as I recall. That has been a lot of time -- parked down since I've worked on that one, but that's about the limit. And the lower peninsula of Michigan peak load is round 25,000 to 28,000 megawatts. So pretty small percentage if you will, of the total capacity needed in the lower peninsula. Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Great. Thank you. John Russell : Thanks Steve. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel, Macquarie. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, sorry. Its James George [ph] on his behalf. The question has been asked and answered. Thank you. John Russell : James, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Okay then, moving on to the last question in the queue, its from the line of [indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. A question John for you, I guess going to, if I am right, slide 25. The payout ratio this year, is around at the bottom of the range of 60% to 70%. Can you see an acceleration of the dividend growth from the 6% historical over the last couple of years in the next four or five years, so how are you thinking about that? How should we think -- reaching to 70% over that time frame? John Russell : Yeah one thing -- first of all, we want to be competitive with the market which is important to us, and we have stated that publicly. The other thing too, as we have talked about in this call, we tend to be growing faster than our peers. In past several years, we have grown at 7%, I think our peer group is about 4%. So as we grow earnings per share, I expect you are going to see the dividend growth be in line with that level. So as we continue to perform in the future, as we have talked about here today, I expect you will see the payout ratio increase to get to that higher end. Unidentified Analyst : What should we expect in a five year range, if we were to start from now? Where would you expect the payout ratio to be, in say, a five years time from the 60% this year? John Russell : I'd say at the low end 5% a year, and at the top end, 7% a year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. John Russell : So just think about earnings growth, which drives dividend, 5% to 7% a year. And again, that would be comped on the two to five years. Unidentified Analyst : Right. But the issue is, if you increase it by 7%, which is the top end of your earnings, which you have been successfully been able to do, the payout ratio would remain at 60%, it won't inch up. Thomas Webb : The payout ratio today is 62%. And what John was trying to tell you is that, if we grew average with everybody else, we'd stay at 62%, and if we are -- if our growth rate is a little higher than others, then our Board will consider following that, and your payout ratio could be higher. What we don't want to get boxed into is, trying to predict that we'd be at 64% or 66% or anything like that. We want to be competitive as John said, and we'd like to grow at our earnings growth rate, and mind you, that we will be faster than most of our peers, which provides an opportunity. But we are not willing to quantify it. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you so much. Thomas Webb : Thank you. John Russell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for all your questions. And now I'd like to hand back to Mr. Russell for closing remarks. Thank you. John Russell : Thank you. I would just close by making a comment about -- I am pleased with our strong performance in the first half of the year. It has given us the opportunity that we have talked about today, to reinvest back into the business to take care of our customers, and that has been our strategy. Its difficult to do, but we work hard everyday to do it, to take care of our customers and our shareholders. The progress that we have made continues, and if things go as planned and we have talked about, we will be on our 12th consecutive year of consistent and predictable performance. We appreciate everybody's interest in CMS Energy, and look forward to seeing you with the upcoming events. Well thank you for joining us today, and I think Steve was right, that this could be a record time and call for us, for a full one hour. So thank you. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a good day.",

Webb - EVP and CFO Analysts :  Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann Operator :  Good morning everyone and welcome to the CMS Energy 2014 Third Quarter Results and Outlook Call. This call is being recorded. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at 12.30 PM Eastern Time, running through October 30. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's Web-site in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Barba, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead. Glenn P. Barba: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our Web-site. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements should be considered in the context of the risk and other factors detailed in our SEC filings. These factors could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers' results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP information. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix and posted to the Investor section of our Web-site. Now, I will turn the call over to John. John G. Russell: Thanks, Glenn, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with an overview of the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Then as usual we'll close with Q&A. The first nine months have produced good financial and operational results. Our 2014 full year guidance remains on track at $1.76 to $1.78, which is at the high end of our original range. Operationally, our efforts are being acknowledged by nationally recognised surveys. J. D. Power and Associates ranks our gas utility the second highest in residential customer satisfaction in the Midwest. The gas utility's improvement from the prior year's study makes it the most improved utility in the nation. Sustainalytics, which looks at a number of sustainable factors, ranked Consumers Energy number one among peers. These recognitions are evidence that our Company is getting better every day. Looking back over the last few years, we have consistently grown 7% each year. This is our 12th year of predictable financial performance. Each year we grow earnings of the prior year's results. Today, we are pleased to provide 2015 guidance of $1.85 to $1.89, consistent with our 5% to 7% growth rate. We are confident in next year's plan and our ability to execute it. We have many upside opportunities that will keep us on track to achieve our long-term organic growth. Election Day is less than two weeks away. We have been watching the local and national races closely. The race for Michigan's Governor has remained as we have envisioned, focused on a number of non-energy issues. The challenger, Mark Schauer, is supportive of an increase in the renewable energy standard, as is Governor Snyder. We will work closely with either administration on making Michigan's energy policy one of the best in the nation. The latest polling results show that Governor Snyder is leading by 4% over Mark Schauer. The Michigan Senate is reviewing energy policy and beginning to construct legislation. Senator Mike Nofs is coordinating two workgroups, one is focused on energy efficiency and the second on renewable energy. An important issue for Senator Nofs is defining clean energy sources rather than just focusing on renewables. This definition may allow us to capture the 300 megawatt upgrade at our Ludington pumped-storage facility. As we look around the corner, we see opportunities to continue to grow the business. The election will be behind us shortly and we can begin focusing on Michigan's energy future. Next year we should see improvements with the passage of the 2015 Energy Law. Our competitive industrial rate structure will take effect late [2015] (ph). [Inaudible] time we may see a final order in our upcoming electric case. As we continue to monitor the capacity markets, we also see opportunities for capital investment that are not included in our current plan. You can see the impact of the new rate design and next year's fuel savings on electric rates. Residential customers will see rates fall about 1%, commercial customers will be down about 5%, and industrial customers will see nearly a 10% reduction. The largest energy intensive industrial customers could see base rates drop up to 15% with the new rate design, and including fuel savings these rates could drop 20% in the next 15 months. These structural changes, rate changes and fuel savings, will improve price competitiveness, competitiveness for all customers, and make Michigan more attractive for large businesses. I receive a lot of questions about how we can continue our performance for our customers and our investors. We begin by increasing customer satisfaction and adding customer value, the foundation of our business model. Every year about 400 employees leave and about 300 full-time employees are hired at lower costs including benefits. With fewer employees, we continue to do more work and improve productivity. This leads to high employee engagement and our Company ranking is among the most admired in the country. Although simple, these strategic steps drive breakthrough results year-over-year. Here's a look at two major construction projects. Cross Winds, located on the east side of the state, will begin commercial operations by year-end. With this investment, we are able to meet the state's 10% renewable energy standard one year ahead of schedule and at a cost less than plan. In the southwest part of the state, a 24-mile, 36-inch pipeline has been installed eliminating the bottleneck and completing a 90 mile span. This pipeline is capable of delivering 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. Now let me turn the call over to Tom. Thomas J. Webb: Thanks, John, and as always we deeply appreciate your interest in our Company and for spending some time with us on our call today, thank you. As John mentioned, our third quarter results of $0.37 a share reflect continued solid progress. For the first nine months, adjusted earnings at $1.42 a share were up $0.13 or 10% from the same period a year ago. And this excludes an increase of $0.03 a share in our long-term reserve for Bay Harbor environmental maintenance. Having completed the remediation, we are truing up the established reserve back in 2004 to maintain for water treatment facilities over the next couple of decades. As you can see here on the shaded circle, we put to work more of the substantial upside from the first quarter with reinvestments in even more productivity and reliability. As shown with the yellow arrow, we have plans to do even more O&M reinvestment during the rest of year, and this is without jeopardizing our ability to deliver earnings growth at the high end of our original guidance which is in the 6% to 7% zone. And as you can see in the dotted circle, our planned cost savings in the fourth quarter more than fund planned capital investment. This reflects the important work we've completed to self fund all of our capital investment in 2014. So in other words, we permanently funded with continuing O&M cost reductions 100% of our 1.6 billion of capital investment in 2014. We are proud of our team that not only has continued our eight-year run of continuous cost reductions, but accelerated them to a level that fully funded a record level of capital investment, and that's without any increase in rates to our customers. This slide, which I suspect is familiar to many of you by now, shows how on top of the large planned cost reductions we have further reduced our cost levels. This as well as favorable weather in the first quarter provides room for investment to improve reliability, generate incremental productivity and pre-fund debt. This not only maintains a conservative risk level, it makes it easier to continue improved performance for our customers and EPS growth at the high end of our peers. Now as the year winds down, there's a number of choices that we have will narrow but the opportunity continues right through the end of year. Thinking about the future, this is another slide that's probably familiar to many of you. The need for important projects requiring a capital investment over the next 10 years exceeds $20 billion as shown in the blue circle on the right. Those needs are up from what we expected just a year ago. Our plans however include just a portion of this need, limited only by our desire to keep our base rate increases below inflation. You may already have noted what's new on this slide. We have updated the projection period from 10 years starting in 2013 to 2015 and we've raised the level of investment from $15 billion to $15.5 billion for needed reliability upgrades, again without jeopardizing our ability to keep customer base rate increases well below inflation. Now I wouldn't be surprised if a year from now we're talking to you about investment plan of something in the $16 billion to $17 billion range rather than the $15.5 billion, and again that's without hurting price competitiveness. [Inaudible] $15.5 billion level of investment, electric base rates are up about 1.5% a year, well below forecasted inflation. Here you can see one aspect of investment that still is not included in our plan. Should ROA customers return to bundled service either naturally or by policy, we would need to add investment to provide another 800 megawatts of capacity. Later in the planning cycle, we'll need to replace expiring PPAs with more than 2,000 megawatts of capacity and we believe we can do that without raising customer bills. These opportunities alone require 3,000 megawatts of new capacity at Consumers and none of it is in our present plan. While you can see this investment creates a substantial upside for organic growth in our business, there are several other upsides ahead. For example even though we've got a pretty good track record on cost savings and a reasonable plan ahead, we likely have more room to improve productivity which can create more room for capital investment, and that's our growth engine. While some companies have increased their cost over the last seven years, we've been able to reduce ours and reduce it enough to fully offset inflation and reduce our absolute cost by 7%. Our plans permit us to achieve another 10% reduction over the next five years. As shown in the right box on this slide, these future savings already have been identified, the decisions have already been made and they would be difficult to reverse. For example, the planned shift from coal to gas generation with the closure of 950 megawatts of coal plants will reduce O&M by $25 million. This simply reflects the fewer number of workers needed to run gas plants compared with coal plants. With the responsible decisions already taken regarding benefits, we'll save another $75 million over the next five years. As we replace retiring workers with new employees and achieve reasonable levels of productivity, we'll save another $75 million, and although we have one of the slower rollouts of smart meters as we prioritized our capital, these smart meters provide new levels of productivity and service and we've counted only $25 million for that. We're comfortable with projecting net savings of $100 million or 10% over the next five years but there may be room to move. Sales may provide additional upside. Michigan continues a robust recovery and is among the top 10 states in GDP growth. Grand Rapids, one of the major locations in our service territory, has an even higher pace of GDP growth. Its growth is in the top 10% of all U.S. cities. Michigan has done pretty well compared to U.S. averages and economic performance in our service territory has been even better. We may not have factored fully this level of economic performance in our sales outlook. As you can see in the box on the right side of this slide, industrial sales have been strong, up 8% this year. Residential and commercial growth has lagged but still up 2.5%, or 3.5% if you exclude energy efficiencies. Our outlook for 2015 to 2018 may be somewhat conservative with industrial growth at about 2% a year and total growth at about 0.5%, and that's fine with us because we'd rather be surprised on the upside than the downside. In fact, here's a listing of some recent announcements by various companies making substantial additions to their business or entering Michigan with new business. These examples alone add 155 megawatts or about 2.5% of sales growth. These will happen over a couple of years and we expect there are a few more announcements yet to be made. On top of that, the Ferrari in the garage is winding up its engine. As capacity prices in Michigan rise, there's an opportunity for our Dearborn Industrial Generation plant to realize profit improvement between $30 million and $50 million higher than what's in our plan. Over the last few months, we've seen good signs including a new long-term energy contract for 250 megawatts at over $4 a kilowatt/month. We also are seeing near-term bilateral transactions for capacity at prices in excess of $3. In addition to that, the DIG plant bid successfully into our competitive utility capacity auction for 25 megawatts in 2015 and 50 megawatts in the 2016 planning year and all at good prices. These are all excellent signs regarding additional upside. Now that's a lot of upside including utility capital investment, cost reductions and sales growth as well as the Ferrari in the garage. As a reminder, we have an active gas case that should permit us to recover $144 million of investment for the 2015 test year. That would be $88 million after cost reductions. This is a simple small case and it's possible it could be settled. We still plan to file an electric rate case at the end of this year for three reasons. First, this is the mechanism to authorize improved rate design that will provide more attractive rates to large job providers without losing our competitive position for our residential customers' bills at about 10% below the U.S. average. Second, this is the process to authorize the purchase of the 540 megawatt combined cycle gas plant in Jackson [inaudible] [lower] (ph) than any other over the last six years and near record. Last, this permits us to recover investment in the 2015 test year, substantially offset by continued cost reductions, and with a roll-off of the 2001 securitization charges of $80 million the rate impact will be smaller. This rate case is a real win-win for our customers and our investors. As we continue with our capital investment program, our CapEx levels at 19% of market cap now exceed the average of our peers. Importantly, our liquidity and operating cash flow levels also exceed the average of our peers. And it's shown on the left side of this slide, our financing work continues to benefit from attractive markets and smart use of good tools. For example, our 2014 securitization lowers cost for our electric customers by $22 million next year and provides more resources for investment in our gas business. In addition, we recently issued a 50-year First Mortgage Bond and it's a first for us and that's the lowest 50-year bond rate for any utility in my lifetime. So coming back to today, we're pleased to share our financial sensitivity table. You can see the impact of changes in sales, gas prices, ROE, and interest rates in 2014, no worries here. And here's our report card for 2014 as well as the new outlook for 2015. We're on a target to meet all of our goals by continued caution that with a need to replenish our fuel inventories from low levels at year-end 2013, our operating cash flow target may be at risk in 2014. It's a temporary issue, recovery occurs in 2015. As you can see, our targets for 2015 show another year of strong consistent growth. I hope you were not surprised by our initial EPS guidance of up 5% to 7% again in 2015 and growth in operating cash flow up another $100 million. I know that some of you believe that regulated utility models have increasing risk, but we hope you're beginning to see just the opposite at CMS. Our efforts to improve our cost, our reliability, customer rates and bills, as well as customer satisfaction actually improves our ability to deliver consistent earnings and dividend growth at a level that you've become accustomed to from us over the last 12 years. Here's our outlook of the overall earnings and dividend growth showing our mindset around consistent good performance at the high end peers for our customers without jeopardizing our consistent high end performance for investors. We're proud of the track record, we're humbled by your interest and we're committed to improving performance every day. So thank you again for taking time to listen to our call today. John and I would be delighted to answer your questions. So, Janet, would you please open the line? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Dan Eggers at Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse : John, I guess as we're moving into the winter season, you covered a lot of topics on the call, but can you just talk about where you guys see the system operationally going in the winter given some of the challenges we saw last year and kind of your comfort on the MISO regions for us, reliability concern with fuel, and all those sorts of issues? John G. Russell: Dan, you're talking about the electric side? Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse : Probably both sides actually. John G. Russell: Okay, I guess we're well-positioned. I mean the storage is full which is great after a very cold winter the beginning of this year, so the team has done a nice job replenishing the field. So I'm comfortable on the gas side. On the electric side, we're good as far as capacity for this year. The real issue in MISO and particularly in Zone 7 becomes 2016. That's when you begin to see the falloff of the retired plants, there will be capacity needs there. The debate going on today is, MISO is looking at their forecast thinking Zone 7 could be anywhere from 2,000 megawatts to 3,000 megawatts short. So from our standpoint, that's something that we're looking at. We've got plans in place so that we need to add capacity, we can, and like everybody is familiar with the plant that we were going to build, the gas plant that we decided not to and instead bought the JP Morgan plant for a much lower cost, everything is in place to move ahead with that one, expansion of the existing plants could take place. So there's lot of opportunities we have here. The big thing is we just need to see where this kind of shakes out with if MISO's predictions are right and what happens with the energy law. As Tom mentioned, there are some \u2013 if the markets begin to tighten, which I expect they will, what you may see is a return from customers who were taking their supply from third-party suppliers today return to us, and at that point that's an opportunity for us to execute some of the plans we have to build the capacity to serve their needs. So that's kind of in summary what the next two years look like, but we're in good shape for next year, the following year is the one that I think a lot more [will tell what happens] (ph). Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse : I guess, John, on that point, if you look at Slide 16 where you guys continue to show the prospective need for a lot of capacity to service customers coming with open access coming back and PPAs went away, when do you guys get comfortable enough to put that into your CapEx program and what milestones should we be looking at for you guys to get there? John G. Russell: One of the things, Dan, that we're doing, our plan is not to build above the growth. So at the end of the day what we do is we look at our forecasts for five years out, 10 years out, but our planning and our construction will really follow where the load goes. So what we will do is, in the short term probably buy from the market and in the long-term build, and that may be different from most regulated utilities that build large incremental projects that go above the growth rate and then wait for several years for the growth to catch up to that. With the hybrid market that we have today, that is a disadvantage to us because if we do that we simply put what seems like free capacity on the market for the third-party suppliers to take advantage of. So ours is to build to that level of capacity, and the good news is, since most of our growth in the future will be renewable energy or growth as far as a fuel source for generation, it will be renewable energy or gas, you have a lot more flexibility in building to that level and not building above it as we did in the old days with coal and nukes. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse : But I guess, John, should we assume that if choice goes away in early '15 with new legislation, would that advance at least the need to address the 800 megawatts of potential load coming back with the change in CapEx plans? John G. Russell: Absolutely, absolutely, when they come back we're going to have the power for them. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse : Okay. And then I guess one last question just on the renewable front here with potential expansion of the renewable energy target, how do you guys see the mix of kind of wind and solar in the next cycle given the fact it was a pretty wind heavy first kind of renewal investment? John G. Russell: I mean I expect that to continue, Dan. The one thing that Michigan has proven with the way the team's built the plants here, the wind regime in Michigan is clearly the most cost advantageous renewable energy source in Michigan. Solar, although it's getting a lot of play in a lot of other areas, it really hasn't taken hold here. Part of it is our conditions here, the lack of huge incentives like you see in some other places throughout the country. And really if you want renewable energy here, wind resources are the way to go. So that's definitely the plan of the future here. Although I think distributed generation to some extent will take off. I think you'll probably see us doing some pilots in certain areas, because if customers want that we want to provide it for them but there isn't the great demand like we see or the economic benefit like we have for the large wind scale projects. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse : Very good. Thank you, guys. Operator : And the next question comes from Paul Ridzon at KeyBanc. Please proceed. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets : I know that that is all permitted, but do those permits sunset at any point? John G. Russell: Yes, they do, Paul. We've got about another I think a year and a half, something like that, 18 months as it is today. So if we move forward with it today in a combined cycle, we could do it, otherwise we'd have to re-permit it. But as we've talked about before, everything is in place. The sites there, we own it, we have generation on-site, electric facilities there are good, the gas facilities are good, and as we talked earlier in Dan's question if there was a need to drive and build that plant soon, I expect that the permitting process would go along very quickly. Thomas J. Webb: And just remember the policymakers really will be driving for it, not against it. John G. Russell: Right. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Great. And how long would that take to re-permit you think? John G. Russell: Less than a year, could be nine months. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets : And then construction is what, pro month 18 months? John G. Russell: Yes, start to finish probably say three years between permitting and final construction. So nine of that would probably be, 9 to 12 permitting but we'd be doing the engineering during that time, and then 24 months for construction. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets : And how should we think about balancing rates with CapEx if a plant is needed, would you defer some of the other capital to keep the 15.5 intact? John G. Russell: No. Great question. We talked about this I think on some of the other calls, is that if the return, if the ROA customers return, that's about $150 million more in revenue to us and it's about a 4% discount for all of our customers across the board if they return. So we would probably, one way to think about is, eat into that 4% reduction to a small percent but all of our customers would benefit from that plant being built, not only in having the reliability in Zone 7 but also the fact the rates would go down not up. Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets : And lastly just an update on what's happening in the UP and the discussion around that. John G. Russell: Yes, what do you want me to say? Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets : I guess it's still a mess, right? John G. Russell: Yes, I mean again let's just for everybody on the call, we're not involved in the Upper Peninsula in Michigan, we don't serve there. But I think what it does, Paul, is demonstrate to a lot of people in Michigan the unintended consequences of what I would call full deregulation. I mean even though it's not but basically 80% of the load shifted from WAC to Integras and right now at least for everybody listening it looks like the impact to 50% of the customers in the [inaudible] increase in rates on December 1, and that is not what we should be in as far as a business. So, yes, I think it's going to change, it changed people's outlook about deregulation. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Brian Russo from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed. Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann : I think you mentioned earlier that the $15.5 billion of CapEx can increase to $16 billion to $17 billion. Is that encompassing the potential for only CCGT if ROA is eliminated, and would that impact your EPS CAGR? Thomas J. Webb: First of all, the first part of that question is, yes, it assumes \u2013 a lot of the capacity that we're talking about is not in the $15.5 billion. So as John just described, we'd have to pick up some of that. Remember, this addition, what we're doing here with the purchase of a plant is one of the cheapest adds of capacity that you'll see, and then building a Thetford is going to be a very efficient approach to what we would do as well. So the answer to point one is, it would increase our cost a bit, so we've left those out. And then question two, I kind of leave it to you to think about what the answer is in regards to what we would do with our earnings guidance, because we look for every opportunity we could. You would naturally think that, let's raise the 5% to 7% to a higher number. We'll stick to the 5% to 7% and look for ways to put that benefit to work for our customers if we can, so we still deliver for them and for you. Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann : Okay, great. My other questions were asked and answered. Thank you. Operator : At this point, there are no further questions. So there are no further questions. John G. Russell: Oh, great, alright, good. Well, first of all, thank you for joining us today on the call. First nine months were good months, they were good position for us, we're in a good position to meet our guidelines. Obviously we appreciate your continued interest in the Company and we look forward to seeing many of you at EEI over the next week or so. So with that, we'll close up the call. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 p.m. Eastern time, running through February 5. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Barba, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead. Glenn P. Barba: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

These factors could cause CMS Energy's and consumers' results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix and posted in the Investors section of our website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John. John G. Russell: Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our year-end earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with an overview of the year before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results and outlook, then we'll close with Q&A. 2014 adjusted earnings per share were $1.77, up 7% from the prior year's actual result. For 2015, we are raising the low end of our guidance from $1.85 to $1.86 per share. The top end remains the same at $1.89. This reflects our plan to grow earnings per share by 5% to 7% off last year's actual performance. Last week, our board approved a 7.4% dividend increase, the ninth consecutive increase in as many years. The new annual dividend of $1.16 per share results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%. 2014 was another successful year, both financially and operationally. The settlement of the gas rate case was constructive at $45 million with a 10.3% return on equity. We achieved our 10% renewable energy target 1 year ahead of schedule with the completion of the 111-megawatt Cross Winds Energy Park. In addition to improving customer satisfaction scores and moving towards a more competitive rate design, we invested a record $1.7 billion in the utility, in the areas of system reliability, environmental compliance, gas infrastructure and technology. These projects add value to our customers and deliver financial results for our shareholders. Our strategy is centered around breakthrough thinking over the long term. We begin by focusing on operational excellence and maintaining our first quartile cost performance. By the end of this year, we will have reduced O&M expense by $150 million since 2006, a 13% decrease on an absolute basis. We are able to grow organically with no big bets, through our transparent, 10-year, $15.5 billion capital investment plan. This year, we anticipate comprehensive energy policy in Michigan. The updated law as well as the predicted MISO capacity shortfall next year could provide future opportunities. Last week, we received an 18-month air permit extension for Thetford gas plant. This will provide us optionality to meet a capacity shortfall but it is not in our plan. We are committed to providing our customers with exceptional value. Our dedication to improving customer satisfaction has moved us from fourth quartile to second quartile for electric and gas business customers, and to first quartile for residential customers; a significant improvement over the past 4 years. In 2016, we anticipate having all 4 segments in the first quartile as we continue to focus on customer satisfaction by delivering the quality service our customers expect. Customer satisfaction is an important element of our breakthrough thinking that leads to predictable financial results. The reelection of Governor Snyder and the reappointments of Senator Mike Nofs and House Representative Aric Nesbitt, as chairs of their respective energy committees, add stability in the political environment. The commission remains chaired by John Quackenbush and we anticipate the appointment of a new Commissioner to replace Greg White, who will be retiring midyear. We look forward to working with these respected leaders to advance energy policy. Energy policy is a priority for the Governor, as he mentioned during his State of the State Address. He wants an energy policy that will be adaptable, affordable, reliable and environmentally sound. The Governor also announced that he is creating a new agency to better coordinate energy policy in the state. He is expected to offer more details when he delivers an energy message in March. The Governor is focused on adaptability over the long term as Michigan moves towards less coal and more natural gas generation and renewable energy sources. We look forward to working with the Governor to support his goals. Each year, we build our growth off prior year's actual result. Our model has continued to produce predictable results that build on the high end of performance. And the company's organic growth strategy continues to support the 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. For 2015, we expect more breakthrough performance. Operationally, we will continue to make safety our top priority for employees, customers and the communities we serve. Our industry-leading cost performance puts us in a desirable position but we're not done. Again this year, we expect to take out more costs through increased productivity while maintaining a high level of employee engagement. By improving customer value and quality of service, we will continue to increase customer satisfaction. This year, we have an opportunity to work with policymakers on a new energy law that will secure Michigan's energy future for the next decade and more. All of this and deliver the predictable financial performance as we have in the past. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas J. Webb: Well, thanks, John. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. I'll cover the 2014 results, 2015, our future plans as well as upsides. As John mentioned, the full year results at $1.77 a share, are up $0.11 or 7% from 2013. As you can see here in the left shaded circle, cost savings fully funded our capital investment in 2014. We avoided both gas and electric rate cases for 2014. We also put to work the substantial upside from better-than-planned cost performance and favorable weather in substantial O&M reinvestments. These approached $100 million in 2014 on top of a similar amount in 2013. This slide, which I suspect is familiar now to almost all of you, shows how on top of large planned cost reductions of $150 million in 2014, we further reduced our cost by $21 million. This and the colder-than-normal weather in the earlier part of the year provided room for substantial O&M reinvestment to improve reliability, generate incremental productivity and prefund parent debt. This not only maintains a conservative risk profile, it makes it easier to continue improved performance for our customers and to deliver consistent, high-end earnings per share growth. We achieved all of our financial targets for 2014. But please recall, we had cautioned earlier in the year that we might fall short of our cash flow target. We're delighted to report today that we are able to accomplish additional working capital improvements to achieve the operating cash flow objective of $1.45 billion. Now looking ahead to 2015. You can see that the O&M reinvestments we made in 2014 already are bearing benefits. Much of our capital investment is self-funded by our own cost reductions, and half of the rate increases needed for 2015 already are in place. We've got a nice, fast start to the year. Earlier this month, we settled our 2015 gas rate case, our first since 2013, at $45 million. This included continuation of our return on equity at 10.3%. The 2015 electric rate case is well underway. It has 3 distinct features : first, it provides us with the opportunity to put the purchase of the new Jackson gas plant in a rate base when our customers need the capacity, and we're proud to do it at one of the lowest purchase prices for a gas plant ever paid; second, we'll be recovering the portion of our customer reinvestments -- or investments, that we have not already self-funded with cost reductions; and then last, this case includes a new rate design, which permits residential customers to stay fully competitive and allows industrial customers to become more competitive. Electric residential bills are below the national average. Industrial rates are above the Midwest average and we have a solid plan to improve. Driven by our own cost reductions, improved rate design, and the prospect that subsidies for ROA customers will disappear, industrial rates can be competitive, too. ROA customers may return to bundled service because of policy changes or naturally as capacity prices normalize. This would end the existing subsidy worth about $150 million. Here's our standard sensitivity table to permit you to evaluate our outlook. Here's our report card for 2015. We continue consistent, high-end earnings growth at $1.86 to $1.89 or up 5% to 7% from the high-end 2014 results. Operating cash flow should grow another $100 million to $1,550,000,000 and with no big bets. Last week, we increased our dividend by 7.5% and plan to stay in the 60% to 70% payout range. Importantly, our total price changes for electric and gas customers will reflect reductions of 3%. Yes, reductions of 3%, further increasing competitive value for our customers. Our balance sheet and CapEx measures are strong, and we're able to self-fund our organic CapEx programs with cost reductions and NOLs. Shifting to the longer term. Our future plan includes : healthy levels of investment; O&M cost reductions; modest sales growth; and a continuation of the 2008 energy law. Both earnings per share and the dividend should grow 5% to 7% each year. Our mix of capital spending during the last 10 years will shift and grow over the next 10 years. We'll be putting more capital investment into gas infrastructure and electric reliability as we continue investment in other important parts of the business. Capital investment grows 45% with no big bets. O&M costs, net of increases, continued to plummet with reductions of 2% in 2012, 3% in 2013, 3% in 2014, and we project another 3% in 2015. Compared with our last call, cost reductions are even bigger. In 2014 and 2015, O&M costs are down 3% each year instead of the 2% we previously reported. This progress reflects our conservative planning followed by better performance. Since 2006, we've reduced our cost by 7% through 2013, and with the acceleration, just discussed in 2014 and '15, we've got a fast start at accumulative cost reduction of 17% by 2018. Weather-normalized sales growth in 2014 was stronger than forecast. 2015 looks stronger than we thought as well, with electric industrial sales up 3% and overall sales up 1%. We still intend to plan 2016 to 2019 conservatively with our estimated industrial sales up 2% and overall sales up 0.5%. We plan to grow operating cash flow by another $100 million to $1,550,000,000 in 2015. That's up $500 million from 5 years ago, and we expect gross operating cash flow to rise to $2.4 billion by 2019, up another $500 million. Our operating cash flow levels already exceed peers. So here's a summary of what we have in our plan, with consistent earnings growth at 5% to 7% a year and good dividend growth that reflects the same. Since 2007, we've raised our dividend every year and on average by 25% a year. Now there are several areas, however, that are not reflected in our plan. These are meaningful upsides. Our capital spending could be substantially higher. Our sales growth and our cost reductions also could be better. In addition, our plan does not assume any changes to the energy laws such as : changes to retail open access, renewables, or energy efficiency standards. These may all result in large upsides. Our capital investment plans over the next 10 years are $15.5 billion, as we mentioned, up 45% from the last 10 years and there's an opportunity to increase that level by another 30%. We'll work to incorporate these opportunities without adding pressure to customer prices. Now here's a great example of that. One aspect that's still not included in our plan is new capacity investment. Should ROA customers return to bundled service either in response to policy or market changes, we would need to add investment to provide another 800 megawatts of capacity. Later in the planning cycle, we'll need to replace expiring PPAs with more than 2,000 megawatts of capacity, and we believe we can do that without raising customer bills by $0.01. These opportunities alone require 3,000 megawatts of new capacity at consumers. None of this is in our present plan. On top of capacity needed at consumers, the Ford GT or alias Ferrari in the garage is fired up. Capacity prices have begun to increase in the Midwest and there is an opportunity for our Dearborn Industrial Generation plant to realize profit improvements of another $20 million to $40 million. We already have locked in $10 million, moving from $5 million to $15 million, with an opportunity to add further $20 million to $40 million and that is not yet in our plan. While we have an enviable organic growth plan, we have upsides : 30% more CapEx; new energy law improvements; higher sales; deeper cost reductions; and higher capacity prices. Our track record's pretty good. Our planned future is brighter than the past and that's before any of these likely upsides. We're committed to high-end earnings and dividend growth, continuing our track record of a dozen years. We're committed to rapidly improving customer satisfaction with better value and performance. We are committed to our customers and to you, our investors. We thank you for your interest and your continuing support. We'd be delighted to take your questions. So Lori, would you please open up the lines? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So quick first question, perhaps just a clarification, if you will. You talk about the ROA and the potential for up to 800 megawatts. Can you perhaps talk about the configuration? What sites -- how many combined cycles or peakers [ph]? Or how you plan to meet that to the extent to which we get clarity on that in the next few months here? John G. Russell: Yes. Let's talk about it. We've got 800 megawatts that are off on retail open access right now. If that does come back, our plan to meet that -- and I don't expect it'll come back, if the law changes or based on market conditions all at once, but the options we have are : buying from the market, increasing the production at some of our current margin units that we have. As you know, we've asked the Public Service Commission to allow us to purchase the Jackson plant, which is another 540 megawatts, plus we have DIG, which Tom had talked about, too. DIG has available capacity in the state that we can purchase, and in a long-term basis, I think Thetford is probably the plant that we'll go to where we did get the air permit extended. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great. So it would just be Thetford in the long term, though, just to be clear? John G. Russell: Yes. Yes. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then on the UP situation, is there any opportunity to be involved there? I mean, obviously, that's kind of wrapping up here, but is there anything you can do on your side? John G. Russell: No. I like where we're at right now. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great. And then perhaps more broadly, as you look towards the energy legislation in the state, and specifically on the RPS side, where does that stand right now? Where are your expectations for the RPS to be increased? And secondly, to the extent to which it is, what are your expectations around being able to rate-base more than 50% as it stands? Perhaps, how are the conversations going, at least initially, if you can? John G. Russell: Yes, let me give you that -- what was that last part, rate-base, 50%? I didn't understand that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Yes. Perhaps, how much of the potential spend could you rate-base? John G. Russell: Yes. The energy policy, I think, is the key question for today. The Governor was pretty clear in the State of the State that he does want to move forward with energy policy. I think the situation that has occurred in the Upper Peninsula, as you referred to, really highlights the need to do something here in Michigan to take care of our customers with the Michigan companies, and not let MISO or the federal government step in to solve the issue that they were talking about before, so -- or what they did in the UP. So I think the timing of changing it is good. As far as the renewable energy, energy efficiency, that will all be part of the mix. I think it's important for us to look at the balanced portfolio, which includes what we're doing by reducing our coal fleet -- reducing the number of units in our coal fleet, increasing the gas. And I think the renewable energy standard will, one way or another, continue to grow in the State of Michigan, and I think that's good. I think it's good for our customers, but it will be a healthy debate with the Republicans in the House, Senate and the administration for the level that we choose. As far as the 50% in the 2008 law, I don't expect -- I mean, one of the things that we've been able to do, which is a tribute to the team, is build the renewable energy cheaper than we have purchasing it from other people. And that's very clear in what we've done over the past several years in the 2008 energy law. So if the intent of the law is to increase renewable energy and do it for our customers and do it in a cost-effective fashion, we ought to be able to do it all ourselves. Thomas J. Webb: So Julien, I'd just add, we haven't assumed any extra renewable investment in our capital investment plans. So remember, when we talk about anything moving up from the 10% standard a little bit or a lot, whether it's 50% or all or none, none of that's in our plan. So that's all upside. That's part of that $5 billion that's not in our capital investment program yet. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great. And then perhaps lastly, what's the timing that you guys see the legislation proceeding? John G. Russell: I think the Governor -- as I mentioned, in March he's coming out with an energy message. So I would expect that he's interested, knowing the Governor, and I think, for those of you that have followed him he doesn't really wait long to get things done. So I expect he will move on it. I think the importance of doing it is important in '15, and its -- I talked about this energy agency that he created. One of the things that he sees, I expect, is the need for better coordination between the various departments in the State of Michigan, particularly as the State of Michigan develops its state implementation plan for -- to be able to comply with the clean power plan. So that really is a, kind of an all-inclusive plan and I think on his view is, let's get as many people are around the table to do this right for Michigan. And so, I think he'll be anxious to move forward on this quickly. Operator : Your next question is from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : John or Tom, this last dividend increase that you announced, and John, you mentioned, 7.4%. Was that a signal of the kind of earnings growth power that you're seeing at least near-term or was that more fine-tuning on the payout ratio? It's a pretty big hike, and I was wondering if there was a message behind that dividend hike? John G. Russell: I Ali, I wouldn't look into it too much, except for the fact that it really did show that the Board was confident in our plan. We shared the 5-year plan with them and as we've told others that we continue to grow at 5% to 7%, and you should expect the dividend growth to be in that range too. So I'd take it as a sign of confidence for our plan. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, John also, I mean you've alluded to retail open access a couple of times. I mean, just -- what's the latest that you are hearing as these things are getting firmed up, energy policy changes, et cetera? Where is the sort of, I think, focus right now legislative-wise on whether to get rid of retail open access or where are you heading? John G. Russell: I think the -- as I mentioned earlier, I think the most important thing that everybody has seen, so I'll use this as a generic, is what's going on in the Upper Peninsula. And when you follow that, and I assume most of the people followed that, Wisconsin Energy couldn't close down their plant because the federal government stepped in, to ensure reliability for the customers in the UP. The Michigan Governor and administration and others stepped in again, then, to prevent that from happening and have their own solution, which I think really determined that the Michigan solution for Michigan customers is best. And the one thing I still don't know is what the impact to the Upper Peninsula customers will be when this is all said and done. What we were able to determine before this deal was cut is that half of the customers up north would see a significant increase in rates on January 1, and that's been postponed. So the reality, the unintended consequence of full deregulation, which, in essence, is what happened in the Upper Peninsula because of the one company going to a different provider, really is playing out now in a way that is causing a lot of people to question this hybrid market that we have here in Michigan. Thomas J. Webb: And we have a lot of confidence that the legislature will do what's in the best interest of Michigan and all of our customers. And to eliminate $150 million subsidy they're paying today is something that certainly gathers their attention. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : I know. And then, you -- again, you folks have alluded a couple of times to stuff that's not in the plan, upside potential, both on the regulated side and with DIG as well. Is there a scenario that you could see out there that, frankly, you come back to us and say, \"Look guys, all of these good things are coming together, we told you 5% to 7%. But you know what, realistically, we're going to be north of 7% just looking at the visibility.\" Is that a realistic scenario that you could actually exceed 7%, given all of these upsides you've talked about? John G. Russell: I don't see that right now. I think that's a question we've had in the past. I like the plan we have today, 5% to 7% growth, that's consistent, transparent and predictable. What we've shown you, and then Tom's slide does a nice job with the weather slide, that we reinvest and increase our expenses as we continue to have upside. And what that is, is it does a nice job balancing -- of balancing financial performance better than our peers, while also having operational performance at or above our peers. And we still have some work to do on the operational side to get to be first quartile in all the areas that we're working on. So I see the long-term, at least in the near-term, the 5-year plan, continuing the progress that we've made, continue the 5% to 7% growth, make more investments, as Tom indicated, if they're necessary, at the utility or if DIG continues to do well. I think the opportunity we have is to make sure that we have best-in-class operations and best-in-class financial results and that's what we're going to shoot for. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : In other words, John, if I paraphrase that, if you are seeing yourselves running above, like you've done in the short term, you will spend more money to keep you within the range; that's the way we should think about it. John G. Russell: That's a good way to describe it. We've continued this approach now, for 3 to 4 years and I expect we'll continue it. Thomas J. Webb: And I would just add, to spend more money to make our customers better off, we still have a lot of things that we need to do and not leave you short at all. We will work hard to deliver on that high-end while we take care of our customers. Maybe 10 years out or 5 years out, it won't be good investments we can make on the O&M side, maybe something will trickle through. But we got a lot of work to do over the next 2, 3 years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just with the Governor's speech in March and the new energy committee coming, what do you guys see as a progression, I guess, to see legislation move this year? How does legislative calendar work for their ability to put something up and get it done and what are realistic timelines for seeing a conclusion at the state? John G. Russell: I think the timeline -- the reasonable timeline is sometime in '15. And you can go through the one slide that, I think, is important is the fact that the Governor's back and both the Senate and House are being -- energy committees are being led by experienced leaders. So the good news there is that they don't have to come up to speed. Most of the Senate energy committee has a lot of experience. Most of them had voted for the 2008 energy law. So the good news is, there won't be as much of a catch-up required for them. And the House, there's a lot of new members, so that may require a little more time on the House side of it. But when you look at this, it's possible, I'd say anytime in '15. I don't want to put a number on it Dan, because it's not -- anything can happen. But the natural time that we've talked about before, natural sunset for the 2008 energy law was or is 2015 and I expect it'll be done by the end of the year. Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And John, as you're feeling that it's important to have your EPA at around 111, do you see a clarity on what those locations are for the state, before they can try and formulate a bigger, grander plan? John G. Russell: Yes. Let me, from -- that's a great question. From my standpoint, you know that we're well positioned to meet the clean power plan; closing down the 7 coal units. We can achieve the interim basis and -- on our path to achieve the long-term basis that they have. What I was really pleased with, and we haven't seen all the details yet, is the Governor looking at this as a comprehensive solution for Michigan. So when he looks at energy departments, the DOE, the Department of Environmental Quality, he looks at the MPSC and having the environmental folks together talking about this, I think it positions Michigan well for the future without surprises. I think the coordination at government can be an issue at times and he's addressing it head on. Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And I guess one of the bounding principles to your CapEx program has been managing customer bills and keeping that inflation below 2%. This year, again, you're below 1% and you're finding better O&M savings than budgeted. What is the outlook for bill inflation over the next couple of years? And does that create room or more flexibility to bump up the CapEx plan? John G. Russell: Yes, I think it does. When you look at that, we -- on a bill basis, we continue -- the natural gas business, we'll start there, is very solid, because of the natural gas system that we have and being able to store natural gas with the prices of natural gas coming down. What you see on the electric side is, that Tom highlighted a couple of his slides there, you see a couple of things. We can continue to grow capacity or grow our capacity, build it while customers come back from ROA. So retail open access customers return, we have $150 million of subsidies that go away, that could be put into paying for the additional capital that we have. Longer term, we have several long-term purchase power agreements that are higher-than-market. And I think one of the slides that Tom showed you there today is, that as we terminate those contracts or they sunset, that we're able to build capacity and save our customers' money. And the one thing, I think, everybody knows, but I'll just mention it again, one of the reasons we can continue our O&M and we don't -- O&M reductions, and we don't see an end to this, is we've addressed the legacy issues, which, I think, we're one of the few companies that have done that across the board including the union. Those are the benefits that keep giving to us year over, year-over-year as we turn over the workforce. The other issue too, is we invest capital. We invest capital for several reasons, but 2 areas that are important to emphasize here : we invest capital to reduce O&M and we reduce [ph] capital to reduce our fuel costs. And there's several examples; going into all this I don't want to give you, but, you think about smart meters. We're installing smart meters, we're almost at 700,000 smart meters, we invest capital, improve customer satisfaction with the ability to read accurately, all the time, to help our distribution operation and to eliminate the O&M cost of reading the meters. And this is going to continue as we shut down the 7 coal plants. We have a larger workforce compared to getting the same amount of megawatts and capacity out of our gas plants with much fewer associated costs. So this future, I see as -- I think, Tom referred to it as bright. I see it as bright. We scratched the surface now, and now, we're starting to see some of the things that we did a few years ago pay dividends as we go forward in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Barnett of Morningstar. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : You've touched on this subject a little bit already, but I wanted to maybe hear some of your comments on, how you're going to deal with new rate design in terms of the conversation with regulators that you've had so far? And do you think that's kind of going to be a fairly easy conversation, given where the Governor stands on it and where, probably, some of the legislators stands on it or maybe, you could give a little more detail on how you expect that to change? Thomas J. Webb: Yes. So you know that's well underway for both the major utilities in the state and there's a lot of different views, no question. But through the working groups that led up to the legislature saying, \"Let's make these changes,\" the commission now has a process underway to go ahead and execute these changes. They will actually help our energy-intensive customers reduce their rates by 16%, overall, our industrial customers by 10%, and then the offset that comes on the residential side, we cover that. We cover that by skipping rate cases, by being more productive, and when you look at the Slide #17, about electric customer prices, that really shows how it works. That shows we're able to keep our residential bills well below the national average and put rate design in place among -- with all the things to do to take our industrial rates and bring them down close to or into the competitive area. So we anticipate there'll be lively discussion because when one goes up, one goes down, it's the way life is. But we also expect that the policymakers and the regulators will look to do what's best and I suspect this will get through. Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. And with the March speech, obviously, that's entirely in the Governor's court and his prerogative, but do you expect there to be kind of harder details? And obviously, there have been a lot of things in the conversation already and he'll probably talk about this new agency as well. But I mean, not necessarily specifics on renewables but maybe some other areas that he's going to be targeting. Do you really expect that to kind of come out in March or is it going to be a, as you said earlier, kind of a through-2015 process? John G. Russell: No. I think he's going to provide more details in March. I mean, for the Governor to state that 1 of his priorities in the State of the State was energy means he wants to get something done on energy. He also indicated in that same State of the State that March is going to have a presentation or discuss the details more. So I expect he's working on it now and I expect we'll all see a lot more details in March. Operator : Your next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division : I know that you said that for now we should assume that you're going to plan within the 5% to 7% aspiration. But I just want to be clear that you also said something additional just now, in answer to a subsequent question that, if there were further headroom created in the business model by either your ability to reduce costs further or to take advantage of the reduction in subsidies or to have to respond to the necessity of getting more capacity into rate base, those would constitute scenarios under which you might be able to exceed 7%. Is that correct? And then I have a follow-up. John G. Russell: No. No. 5% to 7% is our range. That's what we'll continue. Yes. I hope I didn't confuse anybody. If there's capital opportunities in the future, I think the question that was asked of me is, how will that affect your rates in keeping the bills competitive? And we have ways to invest capital and keep the bills competitive. But Greg, what I see happening is 5% to 7%. If we make any additional capital investments and we have better growth than that 5% to 7%, we will reinvest expenses back into the business to get our operational performance to be best-in-class. And I see that happening for the next several years. Thomas J. Webb: And then, I may have misguided you as I said, as you go out through many years there is a point where, if those reinvestments are not economical, they don't make sense to our customers we're wasting their money. We're not going to do that and there could be a little bit of flow through into the guidance, but that's out a few years. We got plenty to do in the next 2 to 3 years. And even though we've got a 10-year plan we're really focused on the next 2 to 3 years, making things work. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Well, I guess, that's my point. There's so many potential capital investments that will be beneficial to the customer and to the Michigan economy that, under certain circumstances obviously, that if you could find more headroom and keep rate increases at a minimum, I guess, the inference would be that you could perhaps do better. But your saying that you'll manage it, right [ph]? Thomas J. Webb: We, sure -- no. I think, Greg, you're right. We would, theoretically, but remember, last year we reinvested about $100 million -- the year before in '13; we did another $100 million just short of that this year, and we see that opportunity to do it again in '15 and '16 if the opportunity persists. And I mean, there's a lot of examples but we had a little bit of a ice here in Michigan this morning, and good -- even though our system's running really well, if we can do more tree-trimming that's a big way to improve reliability. So that's just one very simple example of what we can do. So we don't want to disappoint you, but 5% to 7%. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division : You're not disappointing anybody, believe me. A follow-up question on the capacity-price slide. Just want to be clear. When you say was, now and future, is was what you -- the $5 million, what you earned in '14 is now, $15 million what you expect to earn in '15 and then what's in the guidance? And... Thomas J. Webb: Just for clarity, I will use that slide. We told you previously that we had about $5 million in the DIG numbers for capacity margins, if you will. That number is now $15 million because we have put in place a few of those contracts as we've been layering things in. So that impacts about $15 million; that's in our plan : We built that. But there's still, we think, another upside of $20 million to $40 million as we layer in more capacity contracts and again, we're not trying to wait for a peak. We're just -- as they come up $0.50 or so we'd layer in a few more long-term ones, as they come up maybe, another $0.50, layer in a few more. So it's a slow process. But there's another $20 million to $40 million upside that's not in the plan. We're not comfortable with putting that in our numbers until we know we're going to let those contracts. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division : And that's a business outside of the regulated utility construct, right? So that would be sort of -- if you were to see a scenario where you get very quickly to the, sort of, midpoint of that $20 million to $40 million that could potentially provide an upside to the 7% then? Thomas J. Webb: That's correct. But it also, we -- connect all the dots, allows us to have an opportunity to put a little bit more into the utility, now we haven't under-earned in a long time, but we'd put a little bit more in there and let DIG kind of help that. So we do connect that up, it's not totally separate when we give you that 5% to 7% earnings growth. But I admit, at least it's in a different segment. Operator : Your next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just -- can I just to pick up first on something from Greg's question, make sure I understand, the new 9-year contract at 406 [ph]is that part of the transition to the future scenario? Or is that sort of part of the now? Thomas J. Webb: Yes. That 9-year contract's already baked in. That's included. So what I'm talking about -- and I'll give you a feel for this. This may help you a little bit. We've layered in capacity contracts that cover the bulk of this year for '15. But we could layer in almost another 500 megawatts in '16, another 600 megawatts in '17. So there is capacity there. We've not locked up, because we anticipate that capacity prices will rise a little more than they have today. We're seeing that in bilateral discussions, so that's the opportunity that's not in. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So that -- we should think of the contract as sort of firming up the -- your view of where prices are today, but it's part of that current plan? Thomas J. Webb: Yes, exactly. So remember, when you read that 9-year contract, read carefully, that's energy and that was an update on that. The capacity side, you see a couple of contracts that were done, in fact with consumers, that were recently approved. But we've got a lot of space to move up and we're just not -- you know us, we're so conservative. We're not going to put it in the plan until we're pretty certain that we can do it. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then Tom, I know -- could you give us a little insight into what types of specific items have enabled you to bring the O&M forecast through negative 2 to negative 3 for these 2 years? . Thomas J. Webb: Yes. And I'm going to do that maybe a little bit differently. I'll get to your question this way : to give you a better feel for what's ahead, 2015 compared to what we did in 2014. We're going to get another 3% out even though, everyone's aware, that most all companies have had to reflect the mortality tables. That cost us $35 million. And the new discount rates and for us, that cost us a little over $20 million. So right there, there's $55 million of higher cost. We count it all. We don't adjust it out. We don't say, \"Oh, that's terrible. We just -- we won't count the bad stuff.\" We've fully offset that with better pull-top maintenance that we're doing. There's work in that area that will allow us to be more productive and efficient with what we're doing in O&M, there's $25 million to $30 million there. Our productivity across the board, higher quality improvements is another $30 million, here's a place where you're throwing money down the trash can : Our uncollectible accounts have gone up a little bit in the last year or 2 and no customer's interested in that and neither are you. So we're looking to get $20 million improvement in those uncollectible accounts. IT productivity, gets us another $15 million. Remember the Classic 7, we're getting prepared to go away so some of that cost begins to go away. There's about $7 million in there. Overhead, I'm too expensive, so 1 day they'll get rid of me, but not yet, but there's another $500 million of overhead that we have planned to go away this year. So there were a mixture of things in what I just went through that are a little richer, a little better, than what we have told you previously. So instead of being down 2%, you know we were already looking at all these items. We just didn't want to promise till we felt good about getting them. We're now at 3% and candidly, our internal numbers are a bigger reduction than that. But 3% is all we're willing to put on the table at this point for 2015. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Great. And then can I just ask one thing on the -- did I hear you say that your target dividend payout ratio is 60% to 70%? Or was it that it's just 62% for 2015? Thomas J. Webb: No. It's 60% to 70%. The range we think we'll live in over time. That's us guessing where other companies and our peers will be over time, on average. Very precisely, the number is 62% today. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : But you did then say 60% to 70%. So my question, I guess, is how should we think about the fact that you're at the lower end of that range currently? And your comments about potential for incremental investment. Should we assume that if some of those don't play out, the dividend could really grow even faster or...? Thomas J. Webb: No, I wouldn't think of it that way but I'd think of it this way. The average of our peers is 62%. So that's why we're trying to be there. If that -- and there are some companies that are higher. I think they have a little less opportunity to make capital investments so this is a way to give some money back. As that number goes up, that average goes up, we're going to look seriously at chasing that, unless our 7% or high-end kind of numbers don't get us there, right? So we just want you to know that we doubt the average will go higher than 70%, we doubt it will go lower than 60%. So being at 62% is the average where we should be, but if anything, the bias would be to the higher side and we'll watch that as we evaluate it each year with the Board. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : But it'll be dependent on where the peers track basically? Thomas J. Webb: Exactly. Operator : Your next question is from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital. Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research : I'm actually all set. I meant to withdraw my question. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Russo of Ladenburg Thalmann. Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division : Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just a clarification on the $20 million to $40 million upside based on future capacity prices. Can you kind of book end over what time periods that we might expect that? Thomas J. Webb: Yes. I -- we're guessing, right? And hopefully, intelligent guesses. But we suspect, as MISO sees a shortfall of approaching as much as 3,000 megawatts in our Zone 7, that as people get closer to 2016 when they predict that, they'll want to have the comfort that they're not going to have an issue. So more people will look for capacity and there won't be a lot of it around, and so the opportunities for those prices to naturally go up will occur, we think, in '15 and maybe as late as in '16. So I see us being able to execute contracts on some of the surplus capacity at DIG that we just talked about, in that 500-megawatt-plus zone, in that period. So it may all occur in '16, but I get the sense that there may be a chance yet in '15 as people try to protect themselves appropriately. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just on Slide 23, just a few quick housekeeping items. The fuel savings of $25 million that you have in O&M, what's that about? Thomas J. Webb: So think of that as mix of plants. So as we take our coal plants out and we replace them with renewables and gas plants, it takes fewer people to actually manage those operations. And therefore, that's productivity. That's a lot of people coming out. So... Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I got you, makes sense. Okay and then, with benefits going down $75 million, what's driving that? Thomas J. Webb: So we've done a series of things over the years as much as 9 and 10 years ago, we changed our pension plans, both for salaried and for hourly workers to define contribution program for new employees that come in, and we kept our promise for employees that had these defined benefit programs. So as you can imagine, we have an attrition rate of about 400 people a year and as new people come in to replace them, they're coming in on more attractive programs for them and for the company. Same thing on health care and retiree health care. A year ago, we actually changed our retiree health care sharing. So people that contribute to their health care today will continue to do so, at a lesser amount, but they'll continue to do so in their retirement years, and again, more and more people go into that, our savings continue to compound as we go to the future. So this $75 million is a recognition on what's going to happen over the next 5 years. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. I mean, just to clarify this. Sometimes when changes are happening to retiree benefits, et cetera, those expected reductions are showed up in the current period as a reflux of a lower obligation effectively and it impacts earnings in the near term, if you follow me. It sounds like this is something that you've done in the past and you guys are actually predicting seeing the benefit in the future. Do I have that correct? Thomas J. Webb: You do. Let me just make sure you got it, though. So we did recognize that good news for existing employees. That's history. And now we're going to recognize that, or we're forecasting, as we change our employee mix we'll see more of it. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Okay, that makes sense. And then you mentioned working capital as being a benefit to operating cash flow in 2014. I was just wondering if you could clarify little bit, sort of, quantify that maybe? And sort of what the nature of that was and whether that's going be ongoing? And if so, for how long? If you follow me. Thomas J. Webb: Well, yes, it will be ongoing. But remember the nature of working capital, when you achieve the improvement, you need to repeat that to hold your level of cash flow. So I don't want you to think that you can start compounding what I'm going to say. But we saved over $20 million at the end of this year by simply paying our suppliers when they're due, not before and not late. And we had, had in the past, when the invoice would come in, some of our folks would -- and it was due, say, on January 10, they would just do 1 transaction, authorize that and we pay it in December. What we do now is, we put it in the record that we're going to pay it in January and we don't pay in December, we pay it when it's due. Not late and not early. So that was a good chunk. We had some money out with other people on deposits that were due to come back to us in January and February, and our operational team was able to work with those folks and just say, \"Could we get that cash back?\" Since everything that was needed to be complied with was done in 2014. So we just have lots of things like that where everyday -- it's all part of continuous improvement. How do we make our promise to make our customers better off, treat our suppliers just perfectly, take care of our employees, do all those things and be more productive? And that's what was flowing through some of these working capital improvements. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And you guys expect those to continue? Thomas J. Webb: Absolutely. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Can you remind us how big DIG is? And how much energy and capacity is contracted out for the next few years and what's open? Thomas J. Webb: Yes. So if you take DIG and a couple of small peakers [ph] that go with it, it's 852 megawatts of capacity. And in this year, there's not a lot of left to contract. We're down to having about 50 megawatts open. In 2016, we're presently at 477 megawatts available and then in 2017, it's a little over 600 megawatts. Does that help you? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Very much so. So 470 in '16 and 700 in '17? Thomas J. Webb: No. 600 in '17. Operator : You have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to over to you. John G. Russell: All right, thank you. Well, first of all, let me thank, everybody, for joining us today on the call. We appreciate your interest in a company, your continued support of the company, and we look forward to seeing you at one of the upcoming events. And we'll make sure that we keep working hard for you and for here -- for the customers and you as the shareowners. So, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for their participation.",

[Operator Instructions]. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. D.V. Rao, Vice President and Treasurer, Financial Planning and Investor Relations. D.V. Rao: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements should be considered in the context of the risks and other factors detailed in our SEC filings. These factors could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers' results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the appendix, as well as posted in the Investor section of our website. Now let me turn the call over to John. John Russell : Thanks, DV. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with an overview of the quarter, provide an update on energy legislation and turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results and outlook. Then as usual close with Q&A. First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.73, down $0.02 compared to last year but up $0.04 or 7% on a weather-adjusted basis. In January our Board approved a 7.4% dividend increase, the ninth consecutive increase in as many years. The new annual dividend of $1.16 per share results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%. Today we're reaffirming our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.86 to $1.89. This reflects our plan to grow 5% to 7% off last year's actual results. Our improved safety performance that began in the second half of last year continued through the first quarter. Compared to last year's first quarter, safety improved 58%. Our electric and gas systems continue to perform well. On the gas side we had record sales in February. Capital investments in our electric system have resulted in improved reliability, the best in 10 years. Customer satisfaction has increased for both electric and gas business customers. And I'll talk more about these results in just a few minutes. We also have a tentative five-year agreement with our union, pending ratification. The mutually beneficial contract will support a high level of customer service and increased investment in the gas business. Here you can get a sense of how we're investing heavily in the gas business. We already have one of the largest natural gas systems in the country and we plan to grow it to better serve our customers. Our 10-year plan calls for almost $6 billion of capital investment. We plan on replacing 800 miles of main, installing nine new compressors and connecting 100,000 new customers. We have another $1 billion of opportunity to plan to grow this plan with more replacements conversions and supplying natural gas generators. We're able to continue our investment in the gas business as falling natural gas prices create headroom and offset base rate increases. Over the last six years our customer's average bill has been cut by a third, falling from $3 to $2 a day, supported by natural gas fuel costs declining by 50%. We've been able to do this by cycling our gas storage fields and filling them with low-price gas. As you look over the next five years we see customers' prices staying relatively flat as new investment is offset by cost reductions and low natural gas prices. We're in a good position to invest in the gas business, maintain a high level of system performance and deliver increased reliability with lower prices to our customers. We're committed to providing our customers with exceptional value. Our dedication to improving customer satisfaction has moved us from fourth quartile to second quartile for electric and gas business customers and to first quartile for residential customers, a significant improvement over the last five years. In 2016 we anticipate having all four segments in the first quartile, as we continue to focus on customer satisfaction by delivering the quality of service our customers expect. Customer satisfaction is an important element of our breakthrough thinking that leads to predictable and sustainable financial results. As you know, Michigan is currently in the process of updating its energy law. The Governor is focused on adaptability over the long term as Michigan moves away from coal and more towards natural gas generation and renewable energy sources. His vision provides a constructive framework. The Michigan Senate and House are currently developing and debating legislation. The bills we have seen range from full regulation to an increase in the cap. The Governor stated that he would like to see the cap remain unchanged but would require five years of firm forward capacity. He calls this fair choice. We look forward to working with the Governor and legislators on the energy policy and meeting Michigan's long term energy needs. The Governor has established four pillars to make Michigan's energy more adaptable, affordable, reliable and environmentally sound. We support his vision and see many opportunities to achieve the state's energy goals. Our current energy efficiency program is working well and saving customers money. A continuation of this program with revenue recovery and the existing incentives would make the 15% elimination of energy waste attainable. We fully support the Integrated resource plan process that would allow the regulated utilities to determine the most economic capacity plan. By providing our customers with enablers like our smart Energy program they will have more control over their energy usage and save money. Like the Governor we want to see the elimination of subsidies to a fair choice policy or full regulation without mandates and begin to address the looming capacity shortfalls facing the state. MISO continues to predict a capacity shortfall in zone seven, Michigan's Lower Peninsula. We're nearing this reality as coal plants are shut down and excess capacity is eliminated next year. In order to begin addressing this we need a strong and supportive new energy law. The law will help the state meet its goals by eliminating waste, adding renewables and allowing the state to determine its energy future. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom to review the quarter. Tom Webb : Thanks, John. And thanks to each of you for joining our call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us on the call today. For the first quarter, our earnings were $0.73 a share on both a reported and an adjusted basis. This is $0.02 below last year and $0.04 or 7% above last year on a weather-normalized basis. All business units were well ahead of their plans with company results $0.21 better than budget. As you can see here, the first quarter weather-normalized earnings up 7% and another cold winter O&M reinvestment is underway. Even with huge added costs of about $45 million or $0.08 a share associated with longer lives in the new mortality tables and lower discount rates, our continued cost reductions offset this and result in lower costs, down 3% from last year. Our earnings per share forecast is already $0.17 ahead of plan. Please recall last year when we added substantial reliability work and still hit the top end of our 5% to 7% guidance. This year weather has helped $0.14 and our cost reductions, coupled with other improvements, are $0.04 ahead of plan. Reinvestment underway includes increasing utility forestry work and accelerating a planned major outage at DIG from 2016 to 2015. This has the double benefit of pulling ahead the outage cost into 2015 when we have ample room to absorb it and freeing up capacity in what will be a very tight year in 2016. In addition, we plan to increase DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts. This will add further to profitability next year. While we're on the subject of our business at the Dearborn industrial generation facility, here's an update on both capacity and energy. The opportunity to increase capacity-related profits by $20 million to $40 million already has been enhanced. Just recently we added a new nine-year capacity contract at a price that nearly doubled what we had assumed in our forecast. In addition, we're adding a new long term seven-year energy contract for one of our two combined cycle units that could improve profits by more than $5 million a year. This is in progress. The good news here is that we're beginning to realize benefits from the layering in strategy for capacity, as well as energy, enhancing the upside potential at DIG by as much as $25 million to $50 million a year with long term contracts. Patience is paying off. The outlook for our utility service territory in Michigan continues to be healthy. Whether it's building permits, GDP growth, population growth or unemployment, we continue to outperform Michigan overall as well as the U.S. average. First quarter sales were up nicely, continuing to support our outlook for full-year sales increases of 3% for industrial customers and 1% overall. First quarter industrial sales are below the full-year forecast but that's as expected, reflecting a ramp-up at several customers during the year. In fact, the full-year outlook is about 3% but we prefer to keep the forecast at a conservative level. Please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are intended for our customers. Even without any upside our capital investment over the next 10 years will be 45% greater than the last 10 years. The opportunity to increase that investment by as much as $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly when many of the investment opportunities can be included without increasing customer bills. There is a lot of work ahead but none of it represents big bets that put the company at risk. Capital spending projects are progressing well. For example, we're 40% through our Smart Energy meter rollout. And this has been a terrific project to re-introduce ourselves with each and every one of our customers. Our environmental spending, primarily to address clean air standards, is 85% complete. We still have work ahead replacing gas mains and distribution systems and we're 15% along the way. We've upgraded compressor stations and we're halfway through the work to replace compressors to maximize efficiency at our gas storage fields. As an LDC, remember, we have the largest storage fields in the nation. And our project to upgrade our pump storage facility at Ludington, the fourth largest in the world, is nearly at the halfway spending mark. This project will provide a 16% improvement to capacity. A lot of our capital investment enables us to reduce O&M cost and these are down 10% since 2006. And we will reduce these costs another 7% by 2019. As we switch from coal plants, which require a substantial number of people to run, to gas and wind farms, which require about 10% of the work force needed to run coal, we'll be reducing our O&M costs by over $30 million. By continuing our program to harden our pole tops we will reduce future storm-related damage and we'll capitalize rather than expense that work. This results in lower O&M costs, spreading costs to our customers over a longer period of time. In addition, natural attrition, a variety of quality-enhancing productivity actions and Smart Energy meters will help us reduce our costs substantially. And that's down 3% last year and 3% more this year. Here is our sensitivity chart that we provide each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospects. We've added capital investment and O&M cost metrics to permit you to assess just how much these opportunities might be worth. And here's our report card for 2015. Obviously with the Arctic blast we're well ahead on earnings. We will, however, work to put this surplus to good use with even more reliability improvements for our utility customers and accelerated outages to enhance our outlook for 2016. You'll note that we've graded ourselves with green checks on all metrics and a double check on earnings per share growth. While we're not increasing our guidance beyond 5% to 7%, I suspect that our performance so far this year, coupled with our track record over the last decade, probably gives you a pretty good sense that we feel pretty comfortable. Continuing our mindset that focuses on customers and investors permits us to perform well. We hope you agree. We're now in our 13th year of premium earnings and dividend growth and we plan to continue this performance for some time. Thank you very much for your interest and your time today. We look forward to taking your questions, so, operator, would you please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So I wanted to first dig into the Michigan side of the equation. In terms of the fair choice on the cap, what percent of your customers as you understand the current proposal, would come back to you versus opt to choose the five-year capacity compliance mechanisms? John Russell : Well basically where we're at now, Julien on that, that's just a proposal that's out there. The first choice or the fair choice aspect what the Governor is looking for is that he doesn't want subsidies from our existing utility customers to pay for the capacity that's used as a backup for the retail open access customers. So, a little too soon to tell on that, but basically if it works the way he's thinking, what would happen is they would have to show the firm capacity five years out so that we would not be responsible for supplying that capacity. And based on that, it depends what the market is going to be. I think the numbers we have today -- we've got about 300 customers or about 0.2% of our customers that are on retail open access. It's hard for me to access what their contracts are like or what the market's like, but as you saw in some of the capacity auction results from the MISO market, some of the deregulated states are a little bit higher than the regulated states. So, it would be up to them to determine the best deal that they have. Tom Webb : And let me just add one thought, Julien and I'm not sure your question was going this way, but what we've experienced in the past is when the market changes which this could be a part of we saw about 80% to 90% of that load come back over a period of time say a year or two years this could be a little different depending on the duration of their contracts as John just said but I think the economics will push them our way along with the potential policy change. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent and then looking at the DIG site of the equation in terms of adding the 38 megawatt what's the timing and cost of that by chance? Tom Webb : Will remember we just described that pull ahead. In our presentation today where we were telling you that we're taking an outage that we plan to take in 2016 actually in the fall of 2015 so will have that in place this year that 38 megawatts in that cost of about $8 million to $9 million is part of that pull ahead which includes that upgrade and you won't see that repeated of course in 2016. So the money is being invested this year about 8 million to 9 million for the outage and the upgrade altogether with the benefit accruing to us next year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then the new contract on the nine-year capacity deal that\u2019s annualized at that same rate every year? Tom Webb : That's correct. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: What kind of customer is it just by chance? Tom Webb : Well because as you noticed I mentioned we\u2019re in the progress of doing that I don't want to mention the customer's name, I don't think that would be appropriate. You wouldn't be surprised about who that customer is and the duration that we're looking at here on this contract will probably be about seven years. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: It's not the same counterparty to the nine-year capacity as the seven-year. Tom Webb : So you're working your way into a name, but the answer is no and that's probably as far as I should go. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Dan Eggers : John just going back to the legislation conversation, I guess which bills are most consistent with what the governor has on offer right now and how organized the legislature is to get this done in a timely fashion. John Russell : I'll start with the last first the timing of this, I mean the Governor has targeted it for June. I think it's possible but it's pretty aggressive. And I think that's going to be dependent primarily on a non-related topic which is a ballot proposal to improve the roads in Michigan. If that doesn't get past I think the legislators are going to be more focused on the budget than energy for maybe the summer. So expected to be done by year-end but it may not be done by the middle of the year. And as far as where the bills are they are pretty much across the Board. The house is full regulation, the bill has been set and the house is full regulation. The Senate has two bills one is to increase the cap and one is to ensure that the customers who are on retail open access have a one-time shot at going to the market and they can't come back. So when you look at how that is and what I mentioned earlier about where the Governor is it looks like the top end of this or the worst-case scenario would be 10% with a firm capacity position that they have to disclose to a regulator going forward. And maybe the best case for us would be full regulation but I don't think it would happen all at once and maybe Julian's question kind of related to that is that I think we would see this come back, Tom, mentioned we saw a big jump the last time we went through this but it's going to take time. I don't think it's going to be all at once because I believe and I don't have the data for this but the contracts that the third parties enter into with our customers for retail open access probably have a duration of a year or two. So I don't think any legislation would stop those contracts from being in effect. Dan Eggers : John, beyond the choice issues where do you think things settle out on renewables and is there going to be a window where the increase renewable standard and you guys have a bigger stake of that or how you think that parts going to play into the legislation as well? John Russell : Yes, I think that will end up as a part of an Integrated Resource Plan. I think that's where the kind of the tone is going today rather than mandate a certain percent I think where they would go is more of putting it to an IRP putting it towards a more Integrated Resource Plan that maybe long in 10 year [ph] with the ability to seek approval on a multi-year basis for changes that may occur. And to be more specific as you seen gas prices drop substantially over the past five years if we did in Integrated Resource Plan 10 years ago gas probably wouldn't be a preferred option.  However with gas prices the way they are today they are a preferred option, so you want that -- as the Governor calls it adaptability with changing technologies, changing commodity prices to go back in in the interim of that long term plan to be able to adjust the plan, get an agreement with the regulators and move forward with that type of generation. And Dan, for your point it's also going to include renewable energy, energy optimization and all that. The Integrated Resource Plan will cover the spectrum not just the supply aspect but how we get the supply, what fuel source and how we do energy optimization. And this thing that I like about it is that if we do that it also show the most economic plan, we will put forth the most economic plan for our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Gordon : I just wanted to circle back to the commentary on capacity, so I'm looking at page 14. So you're saying you were at less than $0.50 capacity that your forecast is that you're currently expecting to earn around $2 in capacity? Or did you say that you\u2019ve come in based on this new capacity contract ahead of the forecast on this page. Tom Webb : That's right. So when you're looking at the bar that has below it $2.00 that's our old forecast and then on the little box on the right side you'll see near-term. We're looking at numbers around $4.50 and that's our reference to doubling for that similar period. And over the long term we're looking at if you average it over the whole period around $3.30 so that gives you some benchmarks. To your specific question we've got $2.00 in our numbers but you can see we\u2019re about to revise those and go up. Greg Gordon : Okay and that time period -- over what forecast period do we average go from $2.00 to $4.50 and average $3.30 from [indiscernible]? Tom Webb : $4.50 would be near-term, so you're going to look at the next couple of years. In the long term is over a nine-year outlook. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Paul Ridzon : The $8 million that you're spending at DIG this year that's not -- it's an unregulated asset. So is that capitalized or is that going to be O&M? Tom Webb : Just think of that as a regular non-utility business. So the part that\u2019s capitalized is capitalized and the part that\u2019s expense is expense in the project. Just try not to think utility for a minute and it will look very normal that way. The bulk of it candidly is going to be expensed, that goes in for this year but as you can see we have plenty of room to put it in. Paul Ridzon : So the net impact on '16 is an $18 million swing because you're avoiding that capital expense next year and you're picking up the $10 million? Tom Webb : You can do that math that way but I would caution you not to because remember we're taking the good news this year that's happening unrelated to it to fit it in. So your base didn't change. And then next year yes we had planned to spend about $10 million which we won't need to. But if we've got some head room next year what do you think we will do? Paul Ridzon : Host a big party for analyst. John Russell : What's your second choice Paul? Tom Webb : No, we will find a way as you've grown accustomed to see us get in that growth of earnings of 5% to 7% no matter what. If it's easy or hard and I may as well take the question on before it comes. We've got so much work to do on the reliability side in the utility that I would just tell you there will be a time when we won't and maybe the 5% to 7% will drift up a little bit. Again I would get excited about it because we've got plenty of work to do this year and we will have plenty of work to do next year so it's not in that timeframe that you would likely see us change from our guidance of 5% to 7%. Paul Ridzon : Assuming the contract your currently negotiating at DIG comes to fruition how much -- what's the free capacity look like over the next several years, that's currently unhedged. Tom Webb : Yes. So we'll be for the '17 to '18 planning year a little over 500 megawatts available. And then a little bit better than that a little higher than that in other words as you go through time. So that's all upside opportunity. Paul Ridzon : And this is with the new capacity this will be 750 megawatts total? John Russell : Well no we\u2019re actually making two upgrades and the number you will get used to seeing will be 770 megawatts. So we had already planned and we were just been quiet about it putting in [indiscernible] and increasing the capacity at DIG this year. This new increase which is news because we just authorized it inside of our own company will add that extra 38 megawatts on top of that net-net will go from you've seen 710 in the past will go to 770. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. Andrew Weisel : Just one more on the Michigan law, the energy efficiency side of things I think you said that you would support it with the continuation of revenue recovery in incentives. How likely is that from some of the proposals that you're hearing around the legislature, is it expected that that will continue as is or are people talking about potentially changing the element of it? John Russell : What we're hearing at least right now is I will call revenue certainty the decoupling seems to be optional for the utilities to choose which is fine with us if we choose to do it or don't. The incentives they haven't really dug into the incentives yet, but the argument I think is pretty strong that we make electricity, we deliver electricity we sell electricity we should be incented to help our customers understand why we're not trying to do that with energy optimization. So I have a feeling the incentives that they have worked well for us and I expect those to continue but that maybe in a regulatory format rather than a legislative format. Andrew Weisel : Then on doing some more generally the recent MISO capacity auction obviously cleared low but that's obviously in the near term where you don't see that shortfall yet. Have you seen, you\u2019ve talked a quite a bit about your own contracts but maybe more broadly in the bilateral market have you seen any change in the bidding or the asking since that auction? Tom Webb : I'll tell you what I think will take this into two pieces. Let me just describe a little bit about what we see in the bilateral market. And from a capacity standpoint I would tell you this indication we gave you of $4.50 near-term is reasonably indicative of where we're. Obviously folks out there are watching very carefully what happens in the energy law. The ability to put more capacity in place, the accountability for doing that, those will all be positive things but in -- will the policy is being worked out people are nervous and trying to figure out are we going to fill that big void that begins next spring when we take a third of our coal plants out and have to somehow fell in behind that. So there's a lot of speculation in the markets about where we're go. The best it can give you on bilateral is around 450 for the spring 2016 to spring 2017 planning year. Now you asked a different question about the near term capacity market in MISO and maybe John can add to that. John Russell : One of the things that we found is Andrew, we found pretty revealing as we have talked, we expect the capacity prices to rise in Zone 7 next year when we shut down at least our company shuts down a third of its coal capacity. This year I think the news out of the capacity auction was that capacity prices were low as expected except in Zone 4 for which was the one deregulated state and that was Illinois. And the capacity prices there are 50 times higher than in the generally regulated states of the rest of MISO. So that's an interesting time to see this happen when we haven't seen a lot of the capacity come out of the market. And you can rest assured we\u2019re talking to a lot of people here in Michigan about the risks of the volatility of the deregulated market. Andrew Weisel : Then one last one, you made it very, very clear that the upside to DIG should not necessarily drive faster than 7% earnings growth and how the sales growth and cost cutting is not what's driving your plan here. Maybe a different way to ask a question is when you look out in the near or medium-term what's your expectation on customer bills? You talked about the gas side but maybe more on the electric side if you do reinvest a lot of the upside from these various drivers into this system without charging customers for it, is it possible that we will see customer bills on the electric side falling over the next several years? John Russell : Let me take that one since you don't want to hear Tom anymore talk about -- how we're going to draw 5% to 7%. One of the things that I think is very important to understand about our capital investment plan is that we invest capital for a couple reasons and if we don't achieve those reasons we don't invest the capital. One we need to make sure that it provides value to our customers. Two, it ensures that we reduce fuel costs. Three, it reduces O&M cost and fourth if there's an environmental commitment that we've made to improve the environment whether it's driven through EPA state laws or our own initiatives we do that too. So the customers by us investing capital get a better environment a better bill and better reliability and that's really what we strive for. In the five-year plan that we have today with the capital investment we have we can still keep customer rates below the rate of inflation the base rate increase below the rate of inflation and that's on the electric side. On the gas side that also holds true but as I mentioned earlier with a low grass prices customers are paying bills the same rate that they did in 2001. So we have a lot of headroom, fuel is in our favor in most cases here and where it isn't in our favor because we're making investments on the electric side we're seeing the results and reliability the results in customer satisfaction and the results which I think are unique for us compared to others is the reduction in O&M cost. And we see that happening. Tom showed you the one chart. We're down last eight years 10%. In the next five years we expect to be down 7%. And that's on an absolute basis that includes inflation, it includes the legacy cost that we have. So we feel very comfortable that we invest the right amount of capital to do the things that I just mentioned and keeping the bills affordable. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open. Brian Russo : Just a follow-up on the last question and commentary, you mentioned the gas retail rates are expected to be flat over the next few years due to lower gas prices and cost controls but yet you're go is to keep rates at or below the rate of inflation so is there upside investment opportunity in that segment that you guys can capture. John Russell : Yes. Definitely. When thinking about that Brian it's the cost the base rate our rate of inflation keep it at the rate of inflation but on one of the slides I showed you can see the increase in investment in the capital in the gas business because of the dramatic decline of the natural class fuel cost, we\u2019re down about 50% in the fuel cost which provided headroom for us or does provide headroom for us to be able to make additional capital investments while still having the customers overall bill decline. Brian Russo : Does that imply upside to your current capital budget forecast? John Russell : There's opportunity there, I think I stated we've got $1 billion on top of that if we choose to but right now that seems like the right level. The one thing that we're a little pushed against is we hired about 625 people in the gas business over the past three years and we're growing those people I think it's going to be a competitive advantage for us to have people that can install pipe, weld pipe going forward in the future. So as those people develop we may be able to put a little more capital into it but one thing about the gas business is that it's not just plug-and-play it takes a lot of employees to get that done and what you'll find in some areas contractors are getting a little short now because of the influx in capital. So we made a decision a few years ago to move ahead with our own workforce, worked with our union and we added 625 people to do that which will position us well in the future and so if there was going to increase, think of it incrementally. Brian Russo : Okay. Understood. And then what customer classes are driving for 3% industrial sales growth forecast? Tom Webb : Across the board is the best way to think about what's happening there. And when we're thinking -- if your question is going to what's going to happen in the rest of the year because you did see that we were only up 2% industrial and 1.9% in the first quarter. What we will see in the rest of the year is food there's some folks who have program with us that they're going to need more power will see some increases, building and you know that fits pretty well with economics that we're seeing so more cement and alike. We're seeing a little more on the silicon side, so it's a little more high-tech that's coming in and the aluminum side of the industry. All of these industries have told us they need more and we'll be providing that and we\u2019re already beginning to see that tick up just a little bit. So our forecast is pushing us to say it's going to be higher than 3% industrial growth but we don't -- you know us. We don't want to say that until we actually see that come to do. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I will turn the call back over to our presenters. John Russell : Great. Thank you. Thank you for joining us today. We're off to a good start again this year and we look forward to working with you through the rest of the year and we will put this year's this first quarter's good weather to good use for our customers and our investors. So thanks for joining us I appreciate it. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Rao - VP, Treasurer, Financial Planning & IR Tom Webb - EVP & CFO Analysts : Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CMS Energy 2015 Second Quarter Results and Outlook Call. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 P.M. Eastern Time running through July 30. Presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy\u2019s website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. D.V. Rao, Vice President and Treasurer, Financial Planning and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. D.V. Rao: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements should be considered in the context of the risks and other factors detailed in our SEC filings. These factors could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers' results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the appendix, and posted in the Investor section of our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Tom Webb : Thank you, D.V., and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. And John sends his regrets that he can't join us today. He is recovering from a medical procedure and we look forward to his return in a few weeks. I know he'll miss fielding your questions today. So we'll begin the call with an overview of the quarter and provide an update on the legislative process, before turning to more detail on the gas business, the fast half and our growth model, and then we'll close with Q&A. For the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share were $0.98, down $0.07 from last year but up $0.03 on a weather-adjusted basis, were $0.13 ahead of plan. Today, we\u2019re reaffirming our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.86 to $1.89, and as you know, this reflects real growth of 5% to 7% of last year\u2019s actual results. We filed our gas rate case last week for $85 million. Like our previous cases, it's small and primarily driven by capital investment. Even with this rate case, we expect total customer bills to decrease in 2016 due to lower gas commodity prices. Last month, we self-implemented our electric rate case at $110 million, and we expect an order for this case in December, which would mark 2.5 years since the last order. Our predictable growth has continued over that time and we have self-initiated many cost reductions to keep prices low for our customers. Here you can see the impact of our actions along with constructive regulatory environment. Our industrial rates are at a competitive level that's attracting new business to the state. Rates could be improved further with changes to ROA policy, creating a competitive advantage for Michigan\u2019s business in the Midwest and in the country. As we've improved industrial rates, residential bills have remained low at about $3 a day. Recently we committed do more in Michigan and help grow businesses. Our spending on in state goods and services will be $1 billion per year over the next five years. By helping to make Michigan a competitive state in which to do business, we are seeing growth. In Grand Rapids, the largest city in our service territory, housing, GDP, population growth and unemployment are all better today than Michigan as a whole and the U.S. Overall, Michigan is moving towards becoming a top 10 state and Grand Rapids is leading the way. Michigan\u2019s energy law update can help to drive this growth. Bills are now in committees with the house and senate. Recently Senate Committee Chairman Mike Nofs introduced a comprehensive bill after considerable research and debate. The Senator\u2019s bill proposes to keep the ROA cap. However, the bill stipulates stringent requirements for both, ROA suppliers and customers. In order to protect all customers from reliability and price volatility, the supplier would be required to procure a minimum of three years of capacity. And ROA customers who decide to stay with alternative suppliers would be required to provide a three-year notice prior to returning to bundled utility service. Once the customer returns from ROA, they are no longer eligible to switch back. These policy leaders are broadly in agreement with the integrated resources plan process which would give the state the flexibility it needs among many things, to enable investment in needed new generation and comply with state and federal environmental regulations. The IRP would replace the existing certificate of necessity process with a more comprehensive longer term decision making process. The IRP would provide us with the assurance of recovery and allow us to plan capacity resources for a decade or more. This transparent process could include new gas capacity, renewables and efficiency programs. Now on the regulatory front, I'm please to highlight the Governor\u2019s announcement yesterday of the appointment of Norm Saari as a new Public Service Commissioner. He has a long track record of public and private service in the utility sector and public policy space. We look forward to working with him. We continue to look at and evaluate new investment opportunities that could increase the capital spending in our 10-year plan. When we look at these opportunities, we evaluate each one by asking, does it add customer value; does it reduce O&M cost; does it help balance our fuel sources and/or is it mandated by state or federal regulations, and none of our investments in the plan or those identified as opportunities are big bets. Our gas business is one of the larger distribution systems in the country. This scale provides many investment opportunities for additional growth. We've been upgrading our compressor stations, installing new transmission lines and replacing aging infrastructure. We could do more and we could accelerate the pace. Our plan calls for doubling gas investment over the next 10 years. This brings our investment mix to over one-third gas. Our customers benefit from the safety, reliability and cost effectiveness of the gas plant. If fuel costs remain low, additional headroom will allow us to make these investments without impairing price. On average, our gas customers spend about $2 a day. That's equal to their bill in 2004. Now here's a little more detail on our results. For the second quarter, our earnings were $0.25 a share on both, a reported and an adjusted basis. This is a nickel below last year or a penny on a weather-normalized basis. Weather in June was the mildest in 15 years. Cooling days where 50% lower than last year. Economic sales also were flat as one substantial low-margin customer came through a temporary supply interruption. For the first half of the year, our results were $0.98 or $0.86 on whether-normalized basis. That's $0.03 better than 2014. And at the mid-year checkpoint, we are $0.13 a share or 15% better than our plan. We have lots of room to move. As you can see here with first half weather-normalized earnings up $0.03, we\u2019re positioned well. Even with a nickel of cost in the second half associated with new mortality tables and lower discount rates, our cost reductions of $0.12 more than offset this. For the full-year, costs are down about 3% and new rates already have been implemented. At mid-year, our earnings per share is $0.13 ahead of plan, and like last year and many of the years and the decade prior to that, we added substantial customer reliability work and still plan to hit our 5% to 7% guidance. O&M reinvestment of $18 million is underway, including more forestry work at the utility and accelerating a planned major outrage at DIG from 2016 into this year. The DIG pull ahead accomplishes a double benefit of accelerating the DIG outage cost into 2015 when we had ample room to absorb it and bringing up capacity in what will be a very tight market in 2016. In addition, we'll be increasing DIG\u2019s capacity by 38 megawatts and these reinvestments could add $20 million to profitability next year. From time to time, some of you ask us, how we accomplish consistent earnings growth year-end and year-out and how we do it without raising customer rates above inflation. As you know, we have a robust capital investment program and a substantial opportunity to increase it. However, we build our investment plan starting with customer rates growing no faster than inflation. And here is how we do that. Our O&M cost reductions worth about 2% a year; conservatively forecast sales growth of about 0.5 point a year; avoidance of block equity dilution worth about a point and other self-funds five points of investment. This permits earnings to grow 5% to 7% and customer rate impacts stay below inflation. Here is our capital investment program for the next 10 years. Investment in our gas business grows substantially. Investment in our electric business continues to grow too but at a slower pace. And please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are directed to our customers. Even without any upsides, our capital investment program over the next 10 years will be 45% larger than the last 10 years. As a percent of market cap, CMS investment was 10% over the last 10 years. It\u2019s 16% over the next 10. This exceeds peers. The opportunity to increase that investment by as much as $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly when many of the investment opportunities do not increase customer bills. A lot of the capital investment we put in place enables us to reduce O&M cost. These are down 10% since 2006, and we\u2019ll reduce these costs another 7% by 2018. There is no magic to this cost reduction program. It\u2019s simple. Natural changes in our business like coal to gas generation and Pole Top Hardening make the difference. Here is more detail around cost reduction actions, down 6% in two years as we switch from coal plants, which requires substantial number of people to operate, to gas generation and wind firms, which require about 10% of the workforce needed to run coal, we\u2019ll be able to reduce our O&M by $35 million. By continuing our program to harden our Pole Tops, we reduce future storm-related damage and we capitalize rather than expense that work. These are just a couple of examples of how we\u2019ve reduced our cost 3% last year and are in the middle of a program to do another 3% this year. Since 2006 through 2014, ours is the only utility to reduce its cost, down almost 3% a year. We forecast reductions perhaps conservatively at 2% a year between 2014 and 2018. The outlook for the economy in our utility service territory continues to be bright. As you can see here, many companies from a variety of sectors have announced new factories and businesses. This will add new growth of almost 3%. Despite this, we continue to plan conservatively, including overall sales growth at about 1.5% over the next five years and industrial growth of about 2%. While this is another opportunity in our model to minimize customer rate growth, there may be a little upset. One more element of the self-funding model that promotes robust rate base and earnings growth without allowing customer rates to grow faster than inflation is the benefit from a large stockpile of NOLs. Typically a utility would lose about 1% of its earnings growth through dilution associated with new equity to fund growth. In our case, we\u2019re fortunate to be able to invest our cash in utility growth rather than taxes avoiding full points of dilution. So the model is simple and perhaps it's a little unique. We start our planning by keeping nominal customer rate growth below inflation, or in other words, we provide real rate reductions. With cost reductions, modest sales growth, no block equity dilution and shrinking surcharges, we\u2019re able to grow rate base by 5% to 7% and with substantial opportunity to do more. Many of our capital investment opportunities not yet in our plan can be accomplished without any increase to customer bills. This includes replacing PPAs as they expire and the potential that customers on ROA may return to bundled service, creating more headroom to pull ahead incremental capital investment. So here's the PPA example of growth not included in our plan. We have more PPAs than our peers, and as they are replaced, we\u2019re able to build new gas generation at a cost that's lower than the existing PPAs. What a nice way to grow our business and provide reliability for our customers without increasing their bills. And here is the opportunity should ROA customers choose to return to bundled service. As they return, which may be a better economic choice for them, all our customers can experience rate reductions of about 4%. This provides headroom for more investment to meet customer needs. Think of it by replacing expiring PPAs and building for returning ROA customers, we'd add 3,000 megawatts of new generation that's not yet in our plan. And this is without increasing customer bills at all, a clear win for our customers and a clear win for our investors. You can see the need for new generation in MISO\u2019s most recent report. MISO updated their 2016 capacity forecast showing MISO will be short 1.5 gigawatts in Zone 7 by spring. With our newly purchased Jackson gas plant, we can provide sufficient capacity for our bundled customers. We can't however be sure if AES suppliers can do the same for those ROA customers. And by the way, our mix of coal field capacity has been reduced from over 40% to a third today, and as you can see in the appendix slide with coal plant closures next year, the mix will be below 25%. With our business model, we've been able to deliver consistent earnings growth of more than 7% each year for over a decade, through recessions, through adverse weather, through changing policy leadership and through anything else that came our way. As we do, we hope you to see this as a sustainable model for our customers and our investors for a decade ahead. As you can imagine, with this consistent investment growth, our operating cash flow as a percent of market cap has gone from less than our peers five years ago to greater than our peers today, with prospects that additional growth will provide an even larger cash flow. This is a nice place to be providing resources for the future, resources to invest more for our customers, more rate base growth and/or improve capital structure. So here is our sensitivity chart that we provide you each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospects. In this time of rising and volatile interest rates, it's comforting to know that our model is not very sensitive to changes in interest rates. At the utility, higher borrowing costs related to higher interest rates is largely offset by the impact of higher discount rates on our benefits and retiree programs and perhaps a higher return on equity in the future. At the parent, our practice includes pre-funding parent debt two years in advance and maintaining a smooth maturity schedule. This insulates us from substantial risk to change in interest rates. If for example interest rates rise from our plan by 100 basis points, the annual earnings impact would be less than a penny a share, and we already include high interest rates in our 10-year plan. Here is our report card for 2015. We\u2019re in a good position and at the midway point with substantial benefit from the Arctic blast earlier in the year and better-than-planned cost reductions so far this year. We're putting the surplus to good use with reliability improvements for our utility customers and we\u2019re accelerating outages to enhance the outlook for 2016. Continuing our mindset that focuses on customers and investors permits us to perform well. We hope you agree. We've achieved substantial improvements in customer value and customer satisfaction. We have the best cost reduction track record in the nation. We are in our 13th year of premium earnings and dividend growth, and we plan to continue this performance for some time. So thanks for your interest and your support. We appreciate your calling in, and we'd be delighted to take your questions. So operator, would you please open up the line? Operator : Certainly, and thank you very much Mr. Webb. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll pause for just a second. Our first question comes from Michael Weinstein with UBS. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning, it's Julien here. Tom Webb : Good morning. Nice to hear your voice. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Likewise. So I suppose first quick question if you don't mind, just with regards to legislative developments. Just to be very clear about expectations. As far as the latest proposals from Nof moving through this summer, is that still in line with what you're expecting in terms of return to ROA and return to customers? Tom Webb : The bottom line is yes it is, and I would just comment, keep in mind that we\u2019re not planning on any return in our financial plans that you see. That's kind of all of an upside. We suspect as the policymakers work through this during the summer months and do something before the end of this year that from an ROA standpoint, there may be an economic opportunity that comes out of the law where customers will decide it's probably better to be with bundled service, because they are likely to have to secure not only energy but capacity as they go forward. And to do that, they may find bundled service a better place to do, and that's exactly what we like. We like seeing them make the right economic decisions. So the answer again to your question is yes. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great, excellent. Perhaps coming back to the cost-cutting efforts. Just to be clear, how are you setting up in the next or I suppose the pull forward isn't quite happening to the same extent. What are you thinking year-over-year? Just I know you have a broader confidence in your 5% to 7% growth rate, but how do you think year-over-year in terms of cost-cutting effectiveness? I know it's a little early but just kind of curious. Tom Webb : Well, we feel very good about what we're doing. As you recall, I mentioned that we\u2019re ahead of plan already. You can see that on the reinvestment slide when you have a chance to peek at that. You'll see our cost savings are better than what we anticipated to the extent of about four or five pennies. So that's pretty good. That's a big number. So the plans for this year are good. The reinvestment will continue. Now if I told you how much we\u2019d reinvest at the end of the first quarter call, it would be a lot more. And what I tell you at this call because of the cool weather that we had in June. But when you look at that reinvestment slide, you still see we\u2019ve got lots of room to move and lots of decisions to head, to tailor into what are the right places to put our money and still deliver for you on the profits. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. And a last little detail. As you're assuming we get some developments on the legislation in forthcoming periods, how swiftly thereafter would you anticipate making a filing or talking about new generation construction just in terms of a timeline since we\u2019re coming up against here potentially seeing this legislation going forward? Tom Webb : Yes, a little premature to say exactly what we do because we need to see what the final shape of the plan is, but think of it in two fashions. There will be - likely be this new IRP process. So that will have work done by the state to start planning where we need to be to meet PPA requirements, to do our own state requirements on environmental, all of that. That will be followed by the official IRP process. So that will take a little while. So I suspect what you'll see in the law are some bridging actions. Now I'm just speculating, but take something like energy efficiency to ensure that we continue to do the good work we're doing today, there may be a little bridge that says you continue on the program you have today for a period of time before you go into new things. Is that sort of thinking that wants me to hesitate a little bit on how soon we say we'll announce new capacity, part of it will depend on how the ROA plan goes, returns to customers, part of it will depend on the needs of what may come out of the EPA in August and September, maybe more renewables. So we'll put all that together, be talking to the regulators and policymakers and then probably have something if you made me guess early next year to give you a sense of where we think we're going and what our proposals are. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you very much. Good luck. Tom Webb : Julien, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Dan Eggers : Hi. Good morning, guys. Just extending on Julien\u2019s question about the IRP process. Can you maybe walk through how you see it working as best you can tell right now, working with the commission to kind of layout the parameters for renewables, for efficiency, for conventional generation? And then with the shortfall in \u201816 in Michigan, even with the MISO updates, how you go about trying to resolve that in the context of a bigger policy goal? Tom Webb : I'd be glad to do that. First of all, think about what we'll do. We'll make sure our bundled customers are covered. So from a capacity standpoint, we've got a lot of optionality, even though the state is going to be sure probably at the least the Lower Peninsula [ph] and the spring of next year, we will have tools to take care of our folks. What we\u2019re uncertain about and part of what the law is about is who is going to take care of the ROA customers. Is that something that the AESs are willing to do economically with those ROA customers or it's something where we really do need to step in for long-term planning basis. So here are the steps. First, the public service commission will put some parameters together for the IRP filings. So it will take a little time to do that. Second, within a couple of years of the enactment, there has to be IRPs filed. So you see there is a little flexibility in there, but that's the next step, and that will include a long-term outlook. And then before we file an IRP, if you follow the bills the way they are structured today, we would do bid an RFP to make sure we understand what's out there in the market that we would factor into our plans. Now you might think of that as, what does that mean? You're not going to able to build thing. I wouldn't think of that at all. I'd think of that as the common sense that we use. Remember, we were about to build a new gas generation plant in [indiscernible], and instead we twice went out on our own to check the market. And in the second check, which was last December, we found, my goodness there is a far better deal for our customers. So we were thrilled to put that in place and did that, change our capital investment totals at all? No, because we backfilled with things that we can't fit in today with things that needed to be fit in it and so that worked just perfect. So then when you get into the RFP process, there is they call it a shot clock, interesting a little basketball hooper is in here. There will be a 270 day process for that to go through. So you see that's a little bit of a long process, and therefore there will be some bridging in between on several issues which could include energy efficiencies, it could include a bridging around generation plants where the existing con might be used as a quick process to cover needs in the future and not have to wait for a year or two or so to make those decisions. That\u2019s all up in the air. That\u2019s all the kind of discussion that's happening this summer, and everybody seems to have their heads screwed on very right to make sure that the state and our customers are taken care of. That makes sense? Dan Eggers : It does. Now let me ask the simple question which is when we sit from the outside looking at next year, what should we look from you guys as far as how you address the shortfall in Michigan for \u201816 and \u201817? Tom Webb : Well, two points. First point, remember, we are inside of those numbers you see. We\u2019re covered. We have adequate plans in place to take care of all of our bundled customers. If for some reason there was an emergency and I'll do a theoretical thing, all ROA customers chose to come back to bundled service right away, we would find short-term measures to cover that and think purchases on the market, think use of short-term PPAs, think DIG, think all the list of options like that, there are many. So short-term, we could be in very good shape. Longer term, we want to plan for more certainties. So what we would work on is how to put more permanent capacity in place in Zone 7, so our customers will essentially own their generation as opposed to renting it. Dan Eggers : Okay, got it. I guess one last question, Tom. If you could just - what do you see as the kind of the big bridge drivers if we look at the second half of \u201815 versus \u201814? I think you probably need to make $0.15, $0.17 more in this second half than you did last year. Just what are kind of the chunky pieces you see helping to get to that number? Tom Webb : Yes, that's a good question. If you can, if you\u2019ll refer to slide 12, you will happen to see sort of the best roadmap, but I think it's in the slides first half, second half. When you look at the second half, we already have programmed in actions that give us lower O&M, and that's in the $0.12 that you see, that's largely what that is. And those are all underway, so there is no like new cost reductions that desperately need to be found. And then you've got the mortality tables that are the full-year effect. You remember it was $45 million, so just the portion that impacts in the second half is about a nickel of bad news. Then you got rate release and everything else. Remember, just about all of our rate release that we\u2019re talking about is really second half. So think of the electric rate case as an example. On the electric rate case, we just self-implemented. So we\u2019re actually collecting that. We get all that upside as we go through the second half of the year, something we didn't have in the first half of the year. So I would tell you there is a lot of natural things like that, that don't require a lot of wishing and praying or worrying of any kind. And then have you think about slide 13 that shows the reinvestment plan. We're actually still in the mode of looking where we deploy our resources in steps throughout the course of the year to go from $0.13 better than planned to what would leave you with a good 5% to 7% earnings growth. So we are in, I'd say great shape. This is actually a fun place to be. It's little tougher when it's the other way like it was about three years ago when we had a really mild winter and we had a fine $0.13, which we did, and as you know, the actuals speak for themselves we're in great shape. So not a lot of pressure for us, but you can see our normal cost reductions coming in place. We\u2019re now getting rate release in the second half. We didn't have in the first half. And so the comps, I guess, are a little busy easier if you look at it that way. Dan Eggers : Great. Thanks for time and best recovery wishes for John, please. Tom Webb : Thank you for that. Thanks Dan. Operator : The next question is from Jon Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Jonathan Arnold : Hi, good morning. Tom Webb : Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : Just quick question on the slide where you show the 6% to 8% opportunity versus 5% to 7% in the plan. Tom you mentioned - you have sort of short-term and long-term labels there. Can you just - it seems like you're going a step further towards raising the growth rate without actually doing that. How do you think about short-term, and are you meaning to imply that in the next year or so we could be there? Tom Webb : I think that's fair enough. There is a mix of things, some of which are short-term and some of which are a little bit longer term. So when you think about the generation side of things, those are a little bit longer term adds into our plan, but there is plenty of short-term things to do as well. And I'm actually going to take you to slide that you prefer not to be taken to I think, instead of the one you're talking to, and that\u2019s slide 13 which shows the reinvestment curve again. Here is the best way I can encourage everybody to think about this. There are some very important things we don't have to do but we sure would like to do for our customers. Tree trimming is one of the simplest explanations I have. Our tree trimming cycle is closer to 10 years and it should be closer to five or six years. So the commission is kind enough to give us a little bit more with each rate case and then they know every time we can find an opportunity to do a little bit more when we have good news from cost reductions or weather or whatever it is, we also do a little bit more. What I would caution everybody is, yes, underneath we could probably be growing a lot faster than 5% to 7%, but inside as long as we have that opportunity to do these important things for our customers, we\u2019re going to do those, and I think there will be things like that to do certainly this year, and I think certainly next year, and then we'll talk about the future after that and that's not a hint up or down, we'll just talk about that a little bit later. The other thing it does for us is by doing this work like the DIG pull ahead and like more tree trimming and whatever, it actually makes it easier for us to deliver the next year because our customers are better off, we pull cost ahead that would have happened in the next year or the year after, but it makes it easier for us to deliver the good results that you need to see. So no move from the 5% to 7%, certainly not today. Jonathan Arnold : So the - you do at some point run out of things that you can accelerate like will you catch up on tree trimming and is that part of the motivation for putting this opportunity number out there? Tom Webb : Well, we get asked the question enough that we wanted to show with the investment profile how easy the model works. So if we had more investment, we can do that without putting stress on our customers and still give them average rate increases that are less than inflation. That's the point. The point is less so to say, look for 6% to 8% earnings growth in the near-term, just know that the capacity is there, but our desire to use that capacity this year, next year and who knows beyond that is important and it's paying off. It's paying off for our customers, and then indirectly it's paying off big time for all of our investors by allowing us to have that happy customer group as well as to be able to deliver that 5% to 7% every year. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. So can I just - one follow-up on that, Tom, the NOLs. Can you remind us how much runway you still have on NOLs and how - when those end out of that sort of - how does that fold into the longer term growth outlook? Tom Webb : Yes, we're good on NOLs for several years to go. The gross NOLs are near $1 billion still, and remember, then you got to net that for the tax effect. And I believe in your appendix you do have our operating cash flow slide, and it will show you in the bottom bright yellow bar when anybody gets a chance to look at that, that NOLs and credits are still positive and available all the way through 2020, and the NOLs are used up a little earlier than that depending on bonus depreciation and depending on other tax things. But at this point, we\u2019re still pretty comfortable telling you, we can go five years without any block equity because of that tax opportunity. I\u2019m a little embarrassed because every time I - once a year I have to explain to you it has to go out another year. Probably five years ago, I think we were telling you that we had five years to go and today our time is up, but fortunately we have another five years to go. Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thank you, Tom. Tom Webb : Thank you, Jonathan. Operator : The next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Paul Patterson : Good morning. Tom Webb : Good morning. Paul Patterson : Just wanted to touch base a little bit on the sales growth. Could you give us a little bit more of a flavor as to when we look at the 0.5% growth, how much of that\u2019s focused on industrial versus the other rate losses? Tom Webb : Yes, happy to do that. So we - our first half sales growth weather-adjusted weather-normalized for electric was flat. You'll see that in our addendum, you'll see that data. Paul Patterson : Yes, I did see that. Tom Webb : Yes. And you'll see residential down and commercial up a little bit. That's nothing to really get too nervous about because we've seen that flat to down to up a touch. It\u2019s oscillating. Those two are not making the big recovery. Now typically you would see after recession. So that's still ahead of us. That hasn't started happening yet. The point for today is probably more around the industrial side. When you look at the data, our growth was over 1% in the first half and we know that its underlying growth is better than 2%. So you may say what's happening. Now I have to be careful because I can't talk about a specific company, but there is an individual company that's a big customer, a very low margin customer of ours and they have an interruption on the supply side, and it was a stubborn one. And I'm not even sure and it's not my business to say when they'll be coming out of that, but obviously they\u2019ve worked their way through that. And when that comes back through, you'll see the industrial numbers back up to what we think is a more reasonable level. So keep in mind, we expect that to happen for the future and we really haven't factored in all the 3% of new growth from new businesses locating which will be largely late this year, mostly \u201816 and some \u201817. But the answer to your question was, in the analysis think industrial as of today. Paul Patterson : Okay, but when we look at that 0.5% increase, how much, I guess, what I'm really saying is going forward? How much do you guys associate that coming from industrial versus higher margin residential and commercial? Tom Webb : Yes, I can help you on that. So when you look at that, think of the long-term growth as flat to positive on residential and commercial. And that may be where we are under calling things a bit, because typically there is a point after recession where the jobs and the employment bring in more residential, which brings in more commercial. The industrial side in our assumptions going forward is the main driver because we have great visibility into that. We know the folks that are expanding. We know the folks that are shrinking, if they were, but mostly net expanding. And we know the folks that are coming into the state that have announced, who\u2019ve shared of that and those that are looking that we can announce because they haven't yet. So we feel pretty good on that side. Does that help? Paul Patterson : That's very helpful. Just in terms of the sensitivity since you guys always provide, is that - when we look at that 1%, is that basically across the customer groups or is that pretty much with the same trends that you're seeing in terms of industrial leading that? Do you follow what I\u2019m saying? Tom Webb : I do. That sensitivity we do on an average basis. Paul Patterson : Okay. Tom Webb : So, if you will, think about the sensitivity that would be oriented more to industrial than to residential, that would make the sensitivity a little less so, because residential is key in here. So we do an average. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then IRP versus the mandate, which is one of the differences we see inside the legislation I think. Does that make a significant difference in terms of what you think the sales growth outlook would be, or is it just a question of what\u2019s selected in terms of making the - does it have an impact I guess on decision [ph]. Tom Webb : Yes, I don't think that's going to have a big deal on sales growth and competition where you were going. So when we talk about having or not having a mandate and using the IRP, that mandate would have been around renewables is a simple example. If you don't have a mandate because the policymakers would rather make sure that the IRP process is more thoughtful around what the important things are doing, and in an IRP process you might come up with 4% renewables as opposed to a mandate might say something else. The policymakers think the IRP process will be more thoughtful. And when we get into all the needs for capacity, for environmental compliance and those sorts of things, I think you\u2019re naturally going to see a mix of renewables, a continuing mix of energy efficiency and we\u2019ll probably need to put some capacity in place. So when you were relating it to sales growth, I know you were thinking more choice. I would tell you, we've assumed 10% continues forever in our plans. So if you were to conclude that ROA customers might be coming back in this process that will actually help sales. Paul Patterson : Okay. Tom Webb : Okay? Paul Patterson : That's great. Really appreciate it. Thanks so much. Tom Webb : Pleasure. Thank you for calling in. Operator : I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time, I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Webb. Tom Webb : Thank you very much. We appreciate everybody joining us today. We had a strong first half. We look forward to the second half of the year and we expect to see an improved energy law as we've been talking about today, and we expect to see an order on our electrical rate case in December, and we expect to deliver predictable financial results. So thanks for your interest and spending time with us today. We'll see in the near future. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank you everyone for your participation.",

This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 PM Eastern Time, running through November 5th. The presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. D.V. Rao, Vice President and Treasurer, Financial Planning and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Venkat Dhenuvakonda Rao : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Web, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings new release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements should be considered in the context of the risks and other factors detailed in our SEC filings. These factors could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers' results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix and posted in the Investor section of our website. Now, let me turn the call over to John John Russell : Thank you, D.V., and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. I missed the last earnings calls due to emergency surgery. Now, I'm back and feeling good and I want to thank the management team for doing a great job while I was recovering. Now, let's get to business. I'll begin the call with an update on earnings, provide an operational and legislative update, and talk about some recent renewable energy developments and how those fit into the generation portfolio. And then I'll turn over to Tom, he will discuss in greater detail the quarter and additional upside. Adjusted earnings per share for the first nine months were $1.51. This is up $0.09 from last year, or 10% on a weather adjusted basis. Today we are raising the bottom-end of our 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.01 to a new range of $1.87 to a $1.89. This is up 6% to 7% over last year. In addition, we are introducing 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.97 to $2.01. This is up 5% to 7%, which supports our consistent and year-over-year predictable performance. Here is a view of our past performance and future expectations. Our past earnings performance has been consistent and predictable. We are confident in our plan to achieve the higher end of earnings growth. Further growth up side not in our plan include more renewables, new capacity and more investment in our gas system, already one of the largest in the United States with 1.7 million customers, 29,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipeline, and over 300 billion cubic feet of annual deliveries. Operationally, we continue to have strong performance both electric and gas residential customers' rate us in the first quartile for customer satisfaction. We continue to leverage our large gas system with low natural gas prices and the largest LDC gas storage system in the country. We have invested more than $400 million in gas transmission and compression in recent years and our customers are benefiting from that investment. Our customers are paying 60% less for natural gas than one decade ago, creating headroom for additional investments. Overall, the businesses operating at a very high level and we're sitting company records in safety, reliability, and generation. Recently, our unit three coal plant completed a record continuous run of 679 days. That is the sixth longest ever in the United States. Our major projects continue on schedule. We're seeing better-than-expected results from the Ludington upgrade, smart meters are being very well received by our customers and we're adding more gas compression. In addition to the strong operational results, we've had a string of recent economic development wins. Our strategy has been to partner with state agencies and target companies looking to expand or site new facilities in Michigan. As these customers begin operations we should see an increase our sales and a lift to the overall economy. The update, the Michigan Energy Law continues to move closer towards the goal line. The Senate and House are closely aligned and final bills are expected after hearings are completed this month. Over the next two months we expect committee and full votes from both the Senate and the House. This will allow time for the Governor to sign the Bill into law by the end of the year. A comprehensive update will help to eliminate unfair subsidies and integrated resource plan will ensure there are sufficient resources in place to meet the supply needs of our customers and to comply with Federal and State environmental regulations. But as a reminder, our long-term plan is based on the existing 2008 Energy Law and not changes to this law. We're not waiting for new energy legislation to introduce more renewables into our portfolio. Recently we signed a competitive wind purchase power agreement, the 100-megawatt contract spent 15 years with an option to purchase. We have broken ground on the state's largest solar gardens at Grand Valley State University's campus. By the end of 2016 we plan to have 10 megawatts of utility scale solar on our system. These additions to our portfolio will increase the renewable energy share beyond the 10% required in the 2008 energy law. With the retirement of seven coal units next spring, our coal mix will shrink to less than 24% of total capacity by 2017. The addition of the Jackson gas fired plant will add more flexibility while reducing operating costs. The major expansion at our Ludington Pumped Storage facility also will improve our portfolio. Overall, we're in a good position to meet the EPA's clean power plan. Although, there still is a lot of work to do we expect Michigan to be fully compliant with the deadline. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss the third quarter results. Thomas Webb : Thanks, John. Welcome back. Thank you for joining our call today everyone. We appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. Our third quarter results of $0.53 a share reflect continued consistent progress up $0.16 from a year ago. All business units exceeded plan for strong quarter. For the first nine months, earnings at $1.51 a share were up $0.09. And on a weather normalized basis, earnings were up $0.13 or 10%. As you can see here, and as usual, strong performance positions us for delivering the high end of full year guidance. As shown in the dotted circle cost performance continues to be robust. This slide has become popular with many. Higher than planned cost reductions and favorable weather provide substantial room for O&M reinvestment. This is improves customer reliability, generates incremental productivity and accelerate planned major outage at DIG from 2015 to 2016. I just walked the DIG site and the outage is going very well. The celebration accomplishes two benefits. Accelerating the outage cost into 2015 when we have ample room to absorb it and freeing up capacity and what will be a tight market in 2016. In addition, you may recall that we will be increasing DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts to 748 megawatts. The impact of this reinvestment in 2015 makes it easier to achieve better reliability and profit next year. While we're on the subject to DIG, the Ferrari in garage, you can see that the engine has been purring. As capacity prices in Michigan have risen, we've been layering in profitable contracts. Over the next few years we could exceed our plan by as much as $20 million and as capacity prices reach the level of Kona as much as $40 million. For example, in 2017 about half our capacity and a quarter of our energy is still available. We're discussing a contract now that could use some of this and increase profit by about $15 million to about $35 million in 2017. The bulk of our growth, of course, comes from our gas and electric utility investment. Please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on utility sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are directed to our customers. These do, however, create headroom for more capital investment. Our capital investment program over the next 10 years is 45% greater than the last 10 years, that's 45% greater. More than a third of this investment is for gas infrastructure while many see more convergence. We're fortunate to already have a rich mix of gas in our business. As a percent of market cash, CMS investment exceeded 10% over the last 10 years. It is at 16% over the next 10 years. The opportunity to increase investment by another 30% or $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly when many of the investment opportunities do not increase customer bills. Some of the opportunities include capacity for retail open access customers should they choose to return to bundled service, more renewables, additional gas infrastructure, and replacing PPAs with new generation that will reduce customer bills. And many have commented on our model that starts with the customer and enhances results for investors. This organic capital investment program does not include any big bets. It is, however, what drives our earnings growth at 5% to 7%. We're able to self-fund much of this growth keeping base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. Our five-year plan includes O&M cost reductions worth about 2% a year, a conservative forecast of sales growth at about half a point per year, the ability to avoid the need for block equity dilution worth about another point and other. This self-funds five points of growth without raising customer rates. This is a big win-win with earnings growth at 5% to 7% and customer rate impacts that stay below inflation. Our model is simple. Perhaps it's a little unique. And we have many capital investment opportunities that just aren't yet in the plan. Most of these can be accomplished without increasing customer bills. For example, replacing PPAs as they expire and the potential that customers on - may return to bundled service provides incremental capital investment without increasing customer bill. Now imagine adding the equivalent of about a new 700-megawatt gas plant every few years for the next dozen years and that on top of our plan. Here is some of the key detail around cost reduction actions, down nearly 3% a year on average since 2006. Looking ahead, we don't do it by squeezing a rock. We achieve our reductions with good business decisions. For example, as we switch from coal plants which require substantial number of people to operate to gas generation and wind farms which require about 10% of the work force needed to run coal, we're able to reduce our O&M by about $35 million. For another example, as we lose about 400 workers a year through attrition, new workers are added at a savings of about $40,000 each. This comes from decisions made years ago to bring new hires with defined contribution plans rather than defined-benefit pension programs and on more competitive healthcare programs. This saves another $35 million. Well, we have a clear plan for how we will continue our cost reductions in the future; we're working on new ideas. For example, our call centers are too busy. As we introduce better service, billing, and emergency mobile application we can respond faster and reduce call center workload. This reduce costs. Second, new technology will permit us to modernize the grid more efficiently and maintain our systems at a lower cost. A line loss reduction of 1 to 2 points could save $25 million to $50 million. And third, as we improve customer quality through better work processes, we will save on overtime costs and temporary workers by simply doing it right the first time. Nearly a third of the time when we roll our trucks on a job, something goes wrong. The right parts aren't on the truck or other parties who needed to be on site aren't on time. We are aggressively pursuing these opportunities to improve quality for our customers. Cost reductions come for free. Let me take a minute to update you on the economy and sales outlook. Since 2010 through last year, Michigan's GDP is up almost 14%. That is the third best State in the Union. And the largest city that we serve, Grand Rapids, is up 21%. That's among the top 10% of all cities. You can see the strong economic data for Grand Rapids compared with Michigan and the U.S. on this slide. We continue, however, to plan sales conservatively to help ensure that this is an area of upside rather than a risk. We project that industrial sales will be up about 2% annually for the next five years, with overall sales up about half a point. With a robust business model, we have been able to consider consistent annual earnings growth of more than 7% for more than one decade, through recessions, through adverse weather, through changing policy leadership, through anything else that came our way. As we do, we hope you too see this is a sustainable model for our customers and investors for a decade ahead. Now here is our sensitivity slide that we provide each quarter to assist with assessing our prospects. You can use this slide for 2016 and 2015. There is not a lot of new news that we do here some analysts raised concerns for the sector about interest rates. That is not a surprise. In a time of volatile views about interest rates, I know I've been wrong for 10 years in a row. It is comforting, however, to know that our model is not very sensitive to changes in rates. Higher borrowing costs related to higher interest rates is largely offset by the impact of higher discount rates on our benefits and retiree programs and this excludes a higher return on equity should rates rise a lot. On top of this, our practice includes pre-funding parent debt two years in advance, larger than peer liquidity and maintaining a smooth maturity schedule. This further insulates us from risks to changes in interest rates. So here is our report card for 2015. We are in a good position with substantial benefits from the Arctic blast earlier in the year as well as better than planned cost reductions. We're putting this surplus to good use with reliability improvements for our utility customers and accelerating outages to enhance the outlook for 2016. This will be our 13th year of transparent, consistent strong performance. Continuing our mindset that focuses on our customers and our investors permits us to perform well. We hope you agree we've achieved substantial improvements in customer value and customer satisfaction. We've got the best cost reduction track record in the nation, our 13th year of premium earnings includes premium dividend growth and we plan to continue this performance for some time. So thanks for your interest and thanks for your support. We would be delighted to take your questions. Operator would you please open the line. Operator : Thank you very much, Mr. Webb. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operating Instruction] Our first question comes from Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hi, good morning. John Russell : Good morning. Michael Weinstein : On the legislation, what are the key debates that are currently being talked about in the legislature as those being negotiated, I guess firmed up for eventual presentation to the committees? Are there any major changes that are now being talked about or anything significant to be looking for? John Russell : Yes, let's go through it. Right now I think they're mostly just small adjustments to the bill. There's some issues going on today about retail open access. When they return how many years they have to have capacity, whether it's three years, five years, so there's some issues there. And what's the determining factor for if there is a shortfall Michigan. On the integrated resource plan, I think you're going to see some debate about the difference between having the integrated resource plan and also having a renewable energy standard. So, right now these are kind of I would call adjustments to bring the bills together. We're the very end of this process, so I would expect that they happen, but most of its really revolving around the retail open access. And as the queue continue, there's a queue that we beyond the 10%. The customers come back, do they have the right to leave or do they stay throughout that entire time. So, that's what's going on today. I think an important piece to Tom and I both mentioned and we want everyone to understand, we're not planning for any changes in our plan for the next five years that this law will change. So, if it does change, these are things that can benefit us as Tom talked about in his section of the presentation. Michael Weinstein : Right. So, were you saying that right now the plan is for 5% to 7% growth? Is that something that could change upward if legislation passes that you guys will be talking about later? John Russell : Right now - again with giving you guidance 5% to 7%, we continue to hit the high end of that through the years. Right now you know what our process is and Tom showed it on one of his slides. We continue to go back and reinvest the positive weather, the cost savings for customers and their value. So, we're going to continue to do that. We see plenty of opportunities that way. On the other hand though as Tom mentioned, if the law passes and if all this stuff happens, yeah, there may be an opportunity in the future sometime to with a new plant or PPAs to do something that would cause even additional capital investment for us, which could drive some earnings growth. Michael Weinstein : That's great. Thank you very much. John Russell : Yeah. You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Daniel Eggers : Hey. Good morning, guys. John Russell : Good morning Daniel. Thomas Webb : Good morning. John Russell : Dan you have cold? Daniel Eggers : Yeah, I do unfortunately. Great timing and earnings, unfortunately. So, anyway hopefully I'll be better by EEI. When you think about just trying to bridge the IRP and RPS together, what is it going to look like process-wise and there's going to be a process difference really from how you guys do planning and how you work with the commission if they are separate entities or if they are merged together. John Russell : If - I want to make sure I understand, Dan. The plan, it looks like it's going to, is an integrated resource plan. The process that is used today is the state which I give the governor a lot of credit for this. What he is doing is trying to develop the best plan possible for Michigan and he's coordinating a lot of departments to work on this at the front-end. So there's no surprises at the back in. What the legislation will do, we expect is to support the integrated resource plan. And what I mean by that is to hit the clean power plan target. If we need to reproduce more renewable energy, or more energy through renewable energy or have energy efficiency that will all be included in this plan. Now the good news about the law the way it is today, at least, not the law but the bills that are there is that, that would allow us to go forward and have our capital plans approved to meet the integrated resource plan and that's the assurance we want that as we go forward to meet the plan for the clean power plan which is a federal law that the state law and regulation supports us meeting that target. And I think as many of you know many of the laws - some of the regulations that the EPA has come up with has up an overturned at the last minute. We don't want that to affect our investments and whether it's the right choice. So the preapproval process is important to us. Thomas Webb : It's like a big con. John Russell : Exactly, which is in the current law today. Daniel Eggers : Okay, got it. And then I guess just on the need for open access customers to procure capacity, do you have any feeling for the 3 or 5-year decision process, and would dig be a candidate to provide capacity to some of those customers or do you think that capacity will procured elsewhere before there a chance for the open access customers to get to it? John Russell : I think the three to five years that really is - what we want here Dan and we've been pushing in the legislation, we want to have it material that if somebody is going out to the market and if we have to supply them later, we have to have enough time to build that asset or secure that asset. So I think five years is right. If three years is what it comes down to that probably gives us sufficient time with more risk than the five-year component? And as far as DIG, I will turned it over to Tom because he keeps talking about that for already, so I will turned it over to him. Thomas Webb : I still think it's an important as Mustang GT but whatever. The truth is, even today some of our capacity, not much, but some of our capacity actually goes to some of the AESs to serve retail open access customers. We don't have any bias for or against that, and if there is a change in the law it's probably going to be a gradual change anyhow people need support and we'll provide that. I would tell you the principle purpose though of DIG is to supply folks in Michigan, where it can and to back up the utilities there is needs there. So it has a nice dual purpose and it really is a good engine because for the first time today I kind of admitted that the $20 million for 2016 probably going to look more like $35 million for 2017. It's almost impossible at this point with the contracts that we have not to have that happen. So it is a nice opportunity. Daniel Eggers : Got it. Thank you guys. John Russell : Thank you. Hope you feel better. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Good morning. John Russell : Good morning. Ali Agha : First question Tom or John, you know the investment in the company mechanism that is part of your filing of the rate cases, is that still on the table realistically given the ALJ and staff keep coming back and opposing it? What's your sense right now on the commission's views on that metrics? Thomas Webb : It is still on the table. And for example, in smaller portions it is already being done in Michigan for utilities, but not the big picture. So not the question you are asking for covering all of your capital. So I think some people see this as a wonderful opportunity to actually have better more thorough regulation looking at the total business around CapEx rather than just a narrow slice of one year. So there are folks who think it's a really good thing and, of course, we would be happy with it. And there are folks who think you should not look at that far. Here's what I believe is going to happen. More and more there has been interest and people of asked us more about it in the decision-making process. So we are moving in that direction. If we move into the integrated resource planning process, it may even dump the whole idea because it may give you the confidence you need for capital investment over several years so that you kind of got that support you need. It's a little different, but it's kind of the same answer. So one way or another I think we are all going to be looking further out at the business together so better decisions are made for customers. John Russell : Let me just add to that. I absolutely agree with what Tom said. And look at our gas business, I mean as big as our gas business is and the fact that our prices - customer prices are down 60%, I mean, this is a good opportunity to put the infrastructure in place now without putting a real burden on our customers because their costs are really coming down rather than going up. So that's what we're trying to see in the gas case that we are testing to. Ali Agha : Okay. And then secondly, on a weather adjusted basis, system deliveries have been negative last two quarters and negative year-to-date. Can you just kind of elaborate like what is the trend going on there in terms of that negative trend there? John Russell : The Residential and Commercial segments have been flat at best. So up a little bit one month, down a little bit the next month, sort of flat to down. Industrial has done pretty well and continues underneath to do very well. But in this year we got when customer who had an outage that they are coming back very slowly from. We don't make a lot of money on this customer because it's a very good rate, but it is still important to us for as business. So is there coming back up, we're probably going to see most of that benefit show up next year than some of it this year as we had hoped and anticipated. So the outlook that I'm giving you probably still pretty good where we talk about Industrial at 2% a little bit better, and this is not of energy efficiencies. When you look out to 2016 and we are going to tell you flat to down on Residential and Commercial because candidly they are not picking up like they do out of the typical recovery after a session. So we're going to plan on half a point of growth. We're probably a little conservative. But we will see how that plays out. We would rather be there and not be hurt much in our self-funding plans on rates by counting on too much from sales. But good observation. We have been flat, Residential/Commercial and Industrial which typically would've been up more than you are seeing now is one heavy user who is just coming back from their outage, much slower than they had anticipated. Ali Agha : Got it. And last question. The ongoing cost reduction programs that you have going up for the next few years as well, how do you think about that in terms of the headroom that creates and doesn't try to quantify that in terms of the headroom that creates for rate based investment without customer rate impact. In other words, a $1 saving in O&M, what would that equate to in terms of extra CapEx spending without customer rate impacts? John Russell : So an easy way to see that is slide 17 and the one that says O&M cost performance, and you can see there the dollars and how they are really happening in the next few years where from 2014 to 2018 we will take out about $100 million net, there's a lot of ups in there as well. But net down $100 million and that's worth 10%. So you can do that math and bring it down little bit and think $10 million is about 1%, if that helps a little bit. So then when you think about our self-funding model, we're looking for about two points of cost reductions, so 2%. And that, mixed with the other things we have over the next five years keeps us in a position where we could grow as high as 7% and our customer rates would still be at or below inflation which we're guessing at roughly 2%. So that gives you some of the math that you can work with. I hope that helps. Ali Agha : Yes. Okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot. John Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Andrew Weisel : Hey. Good morning, guys. John, sorry to hear about surgery, having gone through on myself recently. I sympathize and definitely hope you get well quickly. John Russell : Thank you. I'm feeling good. Good to be back. Andrew Weisel : First question, just to elaborate on the O&M conversation you were just having. These other ideas, slide 18, roughly 50 million to 80 million of additional cost savings, can you give us a sense of timing as to when you would make some decisions on those and when the benefits might start to show up ? John Russell : Sure. If you look at them in the categories that we laid them out, the two way communications as we called it, which is more mobility, that's something that's going in place now. But you've got to have your systems well-coordinated to make that work. So I will give you an idea around that. Smart meters in over the next year and two will have most of our smart meters in and with that will come some mobility plus. So that sort of a timeframe where you might see that kind of thing happen. On the grid modernization, I had push that out little bit further, because that's better data, better line sensors, but smart meters, so I would go out several years before I would think of that as an opportunity. So you've got one couple of years from now, another one maybe five years from now and then go down to work management. Now that's one where we will actually get improvements every month, every quarter, every year, and it will start slow. It is this simple. I always tell people when you are changing your process, try this yourself. If you drive a car and you back out of the driveway and you try to back out and turn the opposite direction of what you normally do. It is very hard to do. I guarantee if you try to do that over the course of one week you're going to be wrong at least a couple of times during that week. So it takes a lot of discipline, a lot of work and then a lot of practice to make these things happen. Plus, we need some better systems for our work management and that's going to take us some time to put in place. So I'd say you will see gradual bits of that come in over next year. Small amounts and the in a little bit more the next year and during the life of five years I think you will see a lot of that begin to happen. So I would call that one over five years. I would call technology or line loss past five years and communication something over the five-year period. And keep in mind, some of these will end up blending right in to our plans. They will actually be some of the cost reductions we're talking about, but a lot of these will be incremental and that is a nice place to be. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Thanks a lot for that detail. Next question is the five-year plan, obviously 5% to 7% growth. In the past your slide decks have showed there is upside opportunity of 6% to 8%. Is that something by year end if the Michigan Energy Law goes the way that you are hoping and ROA returns, you might make that change sooner rather than later? I know it's a question you get pretty often in a bunch of different ways, but trying to get a sense of how soon that 6% to 8% might become a target whether it be early in the new year or not until we have a better sense of the nuclear contract or however you can help frame up the timing. John Russell : Let me start and then Tom you may want to pile on this one a little bit. Let me just go back and say again we're very comfortable with our 5% to 7% growth rate. And what has helped us is we really balance the financial performance for investors with the customer value that they get. So, what we're constantly doing is looking at the financial, the operational, and the customer side of this business. We think today for the next several years, there's more opportunity to invest and I'm talking not only capital, but O&M back into customer value and back into operations. Just as Tom talked about in the previous question, here's the truck rolls and some of the things we need to improve on. That's where I think for the next few years we really need to continue to invest and continue to grow at 5% to 7%, which is higher than our peers. What would cause this to change; I think as Tom said in the slide that up there right now, you can see if the law goes into effect, and Tom made a good point I want to emphasize, if the law goes into effect as we expect and there are shortages of capacity in Michigan, which we expected the future, customers will return to us. But it's not going to happen overnight and it's going to take time. So, we will roll that in as we go forward. But if you look at that in the future, if the customer's satisfaction continues to be first quartile and if the operations continue to be best-in-class then there may be a few catalysts that Tom talked about in the out years that would drive us to that. And you saw there, the PPAs are long-term. The retail open access is shorter term than the PPA, need to replace those. That's where I think you ought to think about for us. I mean our plan is pretty good that we have here today and there's upsides which we wanted to show you, but right now we don't want to commit to those yet because there is more work to do in the base business that we have. Thomas Webb : So, I'll just add the real purpose of this slide we show where it says we self-fund a lot of the growth for our customers and their rate is when we are talking about the upside opportunity, we're trying to demonstrate short-term if ROA customers came back and longer-term when we might need to replace those PPAs and we could build gas plants or put in wind farms cheaper than the PPAs. Those are opportunities that we can put in place. And by the way there were - those things I just said as much as $3 billion. But those are opportunities we could do without hurting the self-funding part, without causing our customers to have bills going up any higher. So, that's really the illustration there. Conversations about where we might go beyond five to seven I think are something for the future, but we want you to know we wouldn't go there if we couldn't take care of our customers at the same time. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Then lastly on the long-term load growth, you talked about planning for 0.5%. Is that based on the current Michigan Energy Law? Or is that embedding an anticipation of higher energy efficiency when this law gets revamped between now and year end? Thomas Webb : Well, it could be both. But, what we assume and our numbers now is that we would have about a 1% energy efficiency deduct from the economic growth. And when I say it could be both, the other thing that's not in our numbers is a heavy hand on economic development where we're beginning to see a lot of progress now. So, economic development brings in more customers, spreads that base, there could be room for energy efficiency to go up and be even higher and still get these numbers that were talking about. So I think we've got you in the right ballpark whatever happens. Andrew Weisel : Got it. Thank you very much. John Russell : You are welcome. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Paul Ridzon : Is that foot still the next resource and what's the permanent process there look like now? John Russell : Yes it is. [indiscernible] is existing site that we have. It has gas infrastructure, it has electric infrastructure in place. We currently have a permit that I think extends through this year into next year. So we have an active permit to build on that site that's been approved by the DEQ. I do not expect to move forward with that would pretty much put the project on hold until we see what happens with legislation, but yes it's a great site, it's ready. The community will accept it. We've got some older peekers on the site right today and we could move forward if we need to. Paul Ridzon : Can you give a little more detail of what part of energy legislation is the commonality around? John Russell : The commonality? Paul Ridzon : What aspects of it does everybody agree with? John Russell : I think generally everybody agrees with start with retail open access. We have to do something about it because there's an unfair subsidy. What we do about it, is a debate. Is it 10% with the Q? Is it full regulation which we're moving away from full regulation more to keeping the 10% with probably a one-way door? So if you return you'll stay with utility. The integrated resource plan is a bit of a debate because what the governor is trying to do is, put in a plan that meets the EPA clean power plan that also is best for Michigan. While at the same time, I think some of the Democrats in the House and Senate want to have a standard in there that they can count on to that, that will be part of the law regardless of what happens with the integrated resource plan so that's a debate right now. The commonality, I think we talked about this in the past from a regulatory standpoint, self-implementation will go away but we will advance the timing of rate cases from 12 months to 10 months and if they are not been in 10 months you go into full implementation. It doesn't - it really is. Paul Ridzon : Could I just add a little bit? John Russell : Yes. Thomas Webb : I would just say, you've got two bills one in the house and one in the Senate that it moves closer together. Paul Ridzon : Definitely. Thomas Webb : And there is a lot of similarity in those bills, but there are some people who really don't like certain parts and so of course now is the time people are pushing real hard. So there are individuals who are pushing real hard on different points in different ways that, but I would say the momentum is in those two bills which is pretty good. So I would say there's a lot more commonality at this point, even with a lot of arguments going on from the few people to move ahead with the pretty good law. I think, Paul that we're confident we will be done by the end of year because there isn't - I mean we've had the hearings, the hearings are completed. We are very close and I think they are very close. If they weren't I don't think we would have rated this as successful by the end of the year. Here we are almost in November that in two months the thing is going to get done. Paul Ridzon : The wonderful thing about that is the 2008 energy laws pretty good. Thomas Webb : Yeah. John Russell : And we are in quite a great position if nothing changed but this is a wonderful opportunity to address the EPA rules and to address renewables and to address our way and to address a little bit better regulation. And so there's a lot of opportunity in there for our customers and we are thrilled about it. And I'm going to pile on just one more time, Paul is that, you also have two leaders there three with the governor, but these two leaders have spent a lot of time with Senator Nofs and Representative Nesbitt to get this thing right so that they could be aligned. They have spent a lot of time, a lot of committee hearings and they've been talking about for quite a while. So when they bring it together they want to make sure that the debate is limited. Paul Ridzon : Where is decoupling? John Russell : It is in the bills, whether it makes it or not, we will see. But it is in the bills. On the gas, it exists today. Thomas Webb : So the way it is structured in there is optionality. It so it so that if utility wanted to ask the public service commission for decoupling, then they could do that. It gives the commission the authority to do that with the clarity that wasn't there for both gas and electric last time. And then the commission and the utilities get a chance to decide if they want to put it to use when they get out there in future rate cases. Paul Ridzon : And any update on Palisades? There's been some noise around introducing nuclear plants. Any threats there in the near-term? Thomas Webb : No, we don't see any issues there. I think the filings and the things they are doing with FERC to move along and keep the plant and running successfully appeared to be all going well. You know, our only issue candidly is that at the end of the contract with us we would like to make sure for our customers that it is more economical. If it turns out that building a gas plant is a lot cheaper for our customers then we are going to have to negotiate hard to extend the contract or go with what's best for them. But everything we know and you should ask them rather than us, they appear to be doing a good job. Paul Ridzon : Then lastly, Tom, you said you prefund two years in advance, is it just interest rate hedges or can you elaborate on the process? Thomas Webb : No, we're so chicken, we are unbelievable. We have just because we got frightened in 2002 we never let go of this idea that we just want to be conservative when it comes to the financial side of the business. So for the parent, we actually reach out for two years and we don't necessarily take the debt out, but we raise the debt so the cash is in place. We don't do it with arbitrage or hedging or anything like that. We literally raise the cash. You are going to say what kind of conservative people are you? But we are. So we raise it. We put that in put in place and when economics are right actually call the debt and take it out, we do that. So we have the resources ready to go for two years out in time. And it's just that simple. There's no magic to it. Paul Ridzon : And typically what is that level that you are carrying extraneous? Thomas Webb : Do you mean how much cash? You know, what, this is really easy to do because we give you our maturity schedule on the parent and utility, just look at that and look forward and you can see either that there is nothing left for the next two years or whenever the debt is look at cash line and you will see it is bigger than that. So you can watch that all the time. As we move through time depending on the size of the maturities. Paul Ridzon : Thank you. John Russell : Thank you very much. Thomas Webb : We like being chicken, by the way. Paul Ridzon : We like it to. John Russell : Good. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Venkat Dhenuvakonda Rao : All right. Well, let me close things out. First of all, I want to thank everybody for joining us today on the call this morning. We are pleased with the quarter, and we look for to future success both this year and next year. We look forward to seeing you at EEI. So with that we will close it out and thank you for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on the CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations' section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. Just a reminder, there will be in rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 PM Eastern Time running through February 11. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations' section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. DV Rao, Vice President, Treasurer, Financial Planning and Investor Relations. Venkat Dhenuvakonda Rao - Vice President, Treasurer, Financial Planning and Investor Relations of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer; Patti Poppe, Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and also posted on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to John. John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, DV, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our year-end earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with a review of last year's results and this year's priorities before turning the call over to Patti for a review of our unique customer and investor model. Tom will provide the financial results and outlook, then as usual, close with the Q&A. 2015 earnings per share were $1.89, up 7% from the prior year's actual result. We are raising our 2016 guidance to $1.99 to $2.02 per share. This is an increase of 5% to 7%, reflecting our predictable and consistent 5% to 7% performance year-over-year. Recently, our board approved a 7% dividend increase, raising it to $1.24 per share. This results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%. 2015 was a record-setting year. I'm most proud of our safety result, the best in our company's 130-year history. Our distribution minutes were the best in a decade and the generation plant performance was the best ever. Customer satisfaction rose to first quartile for both residential electric and gas customers. Since 2006, the company has achieved breakthrough performance. Safety incidents are down 79%. Productivity is up 62%. Outage minutes are down 34%, and employee engagement is first quartile. I'm confident this performance will continue to drive the results you have been accustomed to. These areas will continue to improve, and we look to other initiatives to improve service and reduce costs. Michigan currently has a strong energy law on the books. The law supports 10% renewable energy, energy efficiency standards, forward-looking test years, and a retail open access capped at 10%. As you would expect, the Governor is focused on the water issue and Flint. His attention should be focused on helping the people of Flint, a city that we serve. In the meantime, we expect the energy committees in the House and Senate to continue their work. We expect an updated energy law will be passed by the first half of this year. But keep in mind \u2013 and this is important \u2013 the update to the energy law is not in our plan. In fact, we have not included any law related capital investments in our plan. For 2016, we plan to continue our breakthrough performance. Operationally, we will continue to make safety a top priority for our employees, customers and the communities we serve. Again, this year, we are planning cost reductions to our industry-leading performance. We will continue to execute our strategy and deliver the same predictable financial performance as we have in the past. Now, I'd like to welcome and turn the call over to Patti. Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.: Thank you, John. We're especially pleased to announce today that we are raising our guidance beginning in 2017 to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. This reflects the increase in capital investments to $17 billion over the next 10 years from $15.5 billion as announced last week. As most of you know, we have been delivering 7% growth each year for over a decade. While this increase reflects the higher level of capital spending, it demonstrates our comfort in continuing 7% growth, the midpoint of our new range for years ahead. You might ask why we're not raising the guidance for 2016, we still have opportunities to reinvest O&M and to strengthen our reliability and the higher level of capital investment doesn't fully kick in until later this year. Our confidence in the sustainability of a premier earnings growth rate is a reflection of our business model where we self-fund a large portion of the capital investment growth for our customers. We do this by reducing our cost and avoiding the need for block equity with its associated dilution. This model permits us to keep base rate increases at or below inflation resulting in sustainable growth. Both our core and increased level of capital investment are targeted to improve customer service, enhance reliability, and among several others things, increase affordability by providing for cost reductions. The $1.5 billion increase in capital investment includes $800 million in the next five years to replace aging infrastructure and improve service reliability. It also includes another $700 million in the following five years to provide for the clean energy resources we believe will be needed to meet the Clean Power Plan in the most economical way. We still have considerable opportunities for even more capital investment. Those opportunities include replacing PPAs when they expire. These opportunities alone represent the need for an additional 2,000 megawatts of capacity and around another $2 billion of capital investment. We also need to do more with our gas infrastructure and modernization of the grid. And likely, we'll need further capital investments for renewables. None of this is attributable to the update in the 2008 energy law. These investments will be required with or without a change to that law. In the past, we reminded you that we've been able to reduce our cost while most of our peers add cost. Our track record is evidence of our ability to be more productive for our customers and our plans for the future continue this. They are based on good business decisions that have already been made that permit ongoing legacy cost reductions, productivity gains as the workforce turns over, the shift from coal to gas generation, the introduction of smart meters, and the elimination of waste. As we improve customer quality through better work processes, we'll save on overtime cost and temporary workers by simply doing it right the first time. For example, nearly one-third of the time when we roll trucks on a job, something goes wrong. The right parts aren't on the truck or other parties who need to be on site aren't always on time. We're aggressively pursuing these opportunities to improve quality for our customers. For 2014 and 2015, we reduced our cost by 4% and by 2018 expect to have reduced our cost by at least 10%. While our model is successful with our cost reductions, it helps equally as sales grow. Our team believes that our sales growth will be about 2% this year and in the future, but we plan conservatively. For the purposes of executing our model, we're assuming growth of 1%. We put all of this together and end up with the attractive business model for our customers, where their level of service and affordability improves every year and the same model permits us to deliver 6% to 8% earnings growth beginning in 2017. It's a reaffirmation of our confidence in our ability to deliver earnings per share and dividend growth at a level that you have come to expect. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Thanks, Patti. Let's look at the business for 2015, 2016 and beyond. As you can see here in 2015, our earnings grew by $0.12 or 20% on a weather normalized basis. We achieved these consistent results despite the fact that December was the warmest on record, exceeding by 10% the previous record in 1923. For December, Michigan was 37% warmer than normal. As we mentioned last week, we offset the mild weather and a couple of year-end storms by achieving a tax settlement in Michigan, putting off some donations to our foundation and other improvements. With the mild weather, bills were substantially lower than expected which is helpful to our customers, but it also results in lower uncollectible accounts. So weather was not normal, dragging down profits. Our commitment to manage the work was normal. No excuses from us. We're pleased to have continued great progress for our customers and once again delivered on 7% growth for our owners. We achieved all of our financial targets for 2015. These included strong capital investment, healthy balance sheet ratios, dramatic customer price decreases, robust operating cash flow growth, top-end of guidance EPS growth, and as announced last week, another substantial increase in our dividend. For 2016, we're pleased to have raised our guidance to reflect 5% to 7% growth on top of high end 2015 results, which were at the top end of guidance for 2015. We continue to build success upon success, no recess here. While our electric and gas rate cases primarily reflect capital investment, they also permit us to flow through productivity improvements to our customers. This is one of the elements of our model that makes high-end earnings growth sustainable. It's also noteworthy that three quarters of the rate change impact already has either been authorized or self-implemented. And let's not forget the Ferrari \u2013 excuse me, as Patti would say, the Tesla in the garage. After all, the Tesla does zero mph to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds. That's faster than the Ferrari Spider. At DIG, we have long-term energy contracts locked in providing stable results. And with a large portion of capacity available, we continue to have room for upside. Here's our sensitivity slide that we provide each quarter to assist with assessing our prospects. There's not a lot of news, there seldom is. You can see that with reasonable planning assumptions and with robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. And while we look forward to the 2008 energy law update, our plan does not reflect any of the upside associated with it. Our cash flow and earnings growth are driven by our capital investment program. With our recent announcement, increase in capital investment by $1.5 billion to $17 billion over the next 10 years, earnings and cash flow growth will accelerate. Starting in 2017, we are lifting EPS growth guidance to 6% to 8%, bracketing historic growth at 7%. The higher investment kicks in for 2017, and we have more O&M reinvestment to accomplish yet this year. We still have opportunities in excess of $3 billion to add to our plan in the future. For the last 12 years, our gross operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million each year. Since 2004, it has increased from $353 million a year to $1.9 billion. Over the next five years, it should grow about $800 million to $2.7 billion. Cash is king. Our net operating cash flow also grows by $0.5 billion. This reflects capital investment recovery, aggressive working capital management, and honestly, a little help from Uncle Sam. New bonus depreciation is welcome, funding part of our increased capital investment and preserving NOLs for future shelter. Amazingly \u2013 I have to admit, amazingly, we may go over seven years instead of five years with no need for dilutive block equity. While the benefit of bonus depreciation is about a third of our CapEx lift of $1.5 billion, it's half of the rate base increases for the 2016 to 2020 period. With the lift, billing CapEx in behind the Jackson Plant purchase, which was accelerated to December 2015 from 2016, and our incremental pension contribution rate base rises $1.2 billion, one half of which is funded by bonus depreciation. This results in an upside to earnings of $0.02 or 1% a year and that starts in 2017. Here is our new report card. We anticipate another good year in 2016 and an even stronger year in 2017. With no big bets and robust risk mitigation, our model serves our customers and you well. Few companies are able to deliver top-end earnings growth, while substantially improving value and service for customers. Value for customers is what has made our plan so sustainable. Here is how we do it. Reasonable cost reductions of 2% to 3%, conservative sales growth at 1%, and other tools that avoid dilution worth another 2% allow us to self-fund 5 points to 6 points of earnings per share growth. Customer base rate increases can be at or below the level of inflation. This very same model that self-funds investments for our customers also allows us to self-fund a large portion of our capital needs. The model has worked for a decade. It's our plan for the next five years. That's making it attractive for investors and customers and consequently, sustainable. John, Patti and I will be visiting Boston and New York next week, and we look forward to answering your questions about these plans. So until then, Steve, would you please open the lines to take some questions today. Operator : Thank you very much, Mr. Webb. And our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning, everybody. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Good morning. Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.: Good morning. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I guess we've been waiting and debating this \u2013 the growth rate increase for a number of years. So, it finally came. What drew you guys and the board to go ahead and make the decision to officially raise the growth rate now versus waiting for legislation or just kind of following the old playbook of beating every year without raising the growth rate? Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Dan, you've been pushing us the hardest for the longest period. I remember saying uncle in meetings with you, so I'll turn this over to John. John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good setup. Thank you. Really what we needed to do was vest (17:14) the capital. I mean this is what we talked about, I think, in the last call when we announced Patti's succession plan. The end of the day is we can't wait for the law to be done for us to make investments for our customers. And that was clear as we're moving forward. So, as we increased the amount, bonus depreciation obviously took a little bit of that away, but it certainly allowed us to continue to grow at even a higher rate than we had before. But also, keep our customer rates at or below the rate of inflation. And that's something that we finally decided to do. And as Patti mentioned in her presentation, we also have increased the operating cost, particularly in the O&M area that we're seeing the results that our customers want from service and quality, and that's really what we're going after. So now is the time, and obviously with our performance, we think bracketing it between 6% to 8% is the right approach going forward. Go ahead, Patti. Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.: And with our operating plan, we have increased confidence in our ability to control cost and make those capital investments, many of them which help enable those cost reductions to protect our customers from any kind of rate spikes. So we feel very good about the total combined effort to achieve 6% to 8%. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And then I guess kind of in the spirit of keeping the rate \u2013 the bill inflation below the rate of inflation, legislation presuming it gets done and you have another layer of CapEx needs to be spent, does that provide incremental investment opportunities or do you think that just re-sequences how you're going to spend this expanded capital budget? John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I mean, as Tom pointed out in his slides, there are opportunities of $3 billion on top of what we already are talking about. But part of that has to come out of not only the law, but I think what's going to come out of that regardless of the law is what happens with Michigan's response for the Clean Power Plan. I mean that really is going to drive what we do as far as meeting that plan. And those opportunities aren't in there. And as Tom mentioned in his presentation too, we've got some PPAs that are expiring over the next 10 years or within the next 10 years that we need to look at too and see how we're going to replace those. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : I will just add one thing. Patti mentioned just a minute ago the robust nature of the model and the cost reductions that come out of some of the investment. Don't forget, of the $3 billion opportunity in CapEx we just talked about, could be that $2 billion is what John just said related to these PPAs, we can replace our PPAs cheaper than the PPAs. We can build plants cheaper than what the PPAs are today. So therefore, the model really works if and when those come in. We still keep our base rate growth down, and we still can grow a little further. John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Dan, I think what's most important in all this discussion, we continue to do what we say we're going to do. Consistent, predictable regardless of what the guidance is, we tend to hit it, we have it every single year on top of actual results, which I think separates us from some others. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very good. Thank you, guys. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Thanks, Dan. John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Dan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Good morning. Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.: Good morning. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. If I look at the data correctly, I believe weather normalized electric sales were down 0.7% in 2015. Can you just walk through what caused that? Was that a surprising development? And what gives the confidence that it will be up 1% in 2016? Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Good question. And thank you. And you can see that on what we call 11 and 12 of our data that comes out with the press release. The sales were down, and residential was flat, commercial was off a little bit, as you can see there, but industrial was off a little bit. Recall this. We actually can't name the customer here, but we do have a customer who has spent most of the year getting a supply issue taken care of. And so, they have actually dampened our sales through the year. They're not a big margin, so it's not a big issue. They are starting to turn up already, and so their restoration of just getting back to where they used to be \u2013 and I suspect they're going to be better \u2013 will kind of offset the negative with a plus this year. And here's the important part. I would tell you our internal data tells us that we're going to grow more than what we've shown you today. So, where we show you 1% and then 4% on the industrial side, our internal data gives us higher numbers. We just don't believe in going out there with something that we can't deliver on. So, we've put in more conservative numbers. Here's what's going to drive the uptick. I think by the way residential and commercial will still be a little uneven, but I'll just call it flat. The industrial side is coming around because we're seeing new companies hooking up new facilities, new businesses coming into the state and our existing business is doing better. So, for example, we got a brake maker \u2013 high-end brake maker who is going to add 24 megawatts. And I mean they're building the building and doing the work right now, so that's coming out. We see one of our automotive folks actually putting in new paint facilities and running more extended periods of time. That's another big chunk of megawatts coming in that wasn't there before. We see just a variety of people, particularly on the food side, housing side, plastic and rubber sector, and paper and paper product sector that are all giving us precise information about upticks. So, we see some good news and we're happy for that. But we'll tell you 1% growth, we think, will be quite good, suits our model. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. Second question. What happens to the model if anything \u2013 if we do come back into a period of rising gas prices which we used to have, but obviously haven't had for the last several years, does that impact your model and your planning in any way? Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : No, I would just tell you that these prices are phenomenal. And even if they did rise, and I admit if you look at it from this moment to the next moment a year from now, say, they did rise, sure, that's an increase. But people are looking at absolute bills, writing checks. And when they look at where they were \u2013 even if we had a substantial rise and they look at where they were just a few years ago, way better situation, they compare gas for whether it's home heating or industrial or electric, they compare that even with higher prices to alternatives, it's pretty doggone attractive. So we don't see that as a big issue. But I'll tell you again, if you saw the detail of our five-year plans, you'd see that we have gas prices rising quite a bit, and even inside of that, our model still delivers what we tell you about with being able to keep base rates low, bills low if we can and also grow the business. So for us, we don't see an immediate concern. John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me just add there, Ali. One thing about the gas business is to remind everybody we've got a substantial gas business here, the fourth largest in the country. We've got the largest utility storage fields in the country. So at the end of the day when gas prices rise, we've got over 300 billion cubic feet of stored gas both base and working gas that we can draw out which really keeps us competitive in a rising market. It tends to work the other way in a declining market actually because the gas in the storage fields tends to be a little bit higher price than the market. So it does give us a competitive advantage, allows us to use our transmission system fully, but we're buying gas all through the year which really helps our customers. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. Last question. Again, great model, great track record. As you look out over the next five years, 10 years, what's your biggest worry? What could potentially go wrong here? John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I like what we have. I mean, Patti is sitting here next to me. I feel pretty good about the next five years because our plan is unique and we can see clearly for the five years. And the sensitivities that you talk about, we've planned for conservatively. So I feel good about that. I actually think the opportunities we have and as Patti's talked about here with the growth rate and some of the other things we're talking about, are better than we've had in the past. And I will turn it over to you; obviously, it's your five years. Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.: Yeah. I would say that we are optimistic, and we \u2013 to sustain the kind of performance that we have become known for, does require endurance, it requires innovation and we have that. And so we are prepared. We have a good eye on what our opportunities are to continue to make the model work. And so, we are, I would say, very optimistic about our future look here in the next five years to 10 years. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Thanks, Ali. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. And Jonathan Arnold, your line is open. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Jonathan, you might be on mute. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Good morning, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I'm looking at the Tesla slide. Could you just help me with one question on that? Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Yeah. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: The capacity line, are those percentages? Is that megawatts or...? Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : So, when you look down at the yellow bright part in the bottom, that's the percent available. So, if you look at capacity in the future, we have 90% of our capacity available. Now, near-term, obviously, we don't. So, in 2016, there's 10% available and 2017 25% available, then we've held our powder dry beyond that. So, when you look at the energy line, you can see it's only 25% available. We've contracted most of that. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then how deep are those markets? And what kind of visibility do you have on pricing? Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Well, the bilateral markets do a lot to tell you where you really are right now. Our sense is the energy markets got to some pretty good levels that we liked. So, over the last couple of years, we locked in some long-term contracts. On the capacity markets, we still see there's going to be some movement up and down and we see in the ups, there will be opportunity. You may recall from the past, we're not trying to wait for a peak and miss it. We're just layering in these capacity contracts as we get to a little bit better level. So, we were doing it at $1 and then $2 and $3, and we've done some recently in the $3-plus zone. But we think there's still going to be some opportunities. We like having DIG available as a backup as it had to bid into our utility, but we also like the opportunity that when those markets rise a little bit because people see a shortfall in zone seven, we can service that market and that's the upside of the $20 million and $40 million that shows on the slide. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: What's the latest MISO view on the capacity adequacy in zone seven? John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Paul, it looks like \u2013 I will use what the commission has. The latest update is we're about at the capacity level. We're about 500 megawatts short for zone seven for this year. But based on 22,000 megawatts, that's in the noise. So really, I think the outlook if you're thinking about the future \u2013 let's look at 2017. I mean as you know, we're closing seven plants in April of this year. There is some other activity that may occur based on the Clean Power Plan. So let's see what happens in 2017. But right now, Michigan should be good for this year. I don't see that as a problem. But we're right at about that line right now. And also, there's not a lot of new plants being built. So, really it's using the excess capacity up. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : So you can figure our view by looking at that slide you just reviewed, we would not hold 90% of our capacity available for the long-term future if we thought over time there was no opportunity for uptick in those prices. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. And I think \u2013 how many years is it now you've hit the top end of 5% to 7%? Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : 13. John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : (29:44) John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Tom, say that again, 13. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : 13. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Can I assume from that you're pretty confident that you can hit the top end of the new range? John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I certainly am. Patti? Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.: We have communicated a range of 6% to 8%. We're very confident in our 7% performance, which is the midpoint of that range. John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a good model. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. And when do we go to 7% to 9%? John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Paul. Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.: Nice talking to you, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks guys. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : There is one thing that I will add as I know you're pulling our leg a little bit on that. But remember what we have said for a long time, we might get up to 6% to 8% because we really think that is the very high end of the best performers who can do it year in and year out. We think when you try to become something you are not, so you try to get performance that's better than a utility. Again, it's only a matter of time before the model breaks. That's why we believe so passionately in the model. We could give you 9% and 10%, but our customers would feel it, so that's not very sustainable. So sorry, my $0.02. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, again. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Good morning. Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.: Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So, first quick question, a little bit of a follow-up actually. Let's talk about what's in the garage there again if you will. I want to know \u2013 the Tesla, let's say. What is the long-term assumption here? So clearly, we have a potential short situation in the near or medium term. You're raising your long-term expectations. How do you juxtapose the higher growth rate with the price trajectory in the long term here for MISO capacity? And I suppose that's implicitly asking where do you see prices going again in the five year to 10 year range? Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : So it's interesting, you tied the Tesla slide which is not the utility to the utility story. And what I would tell you, we see our earnings growth and 90%-plus of our business out of the utility in that 6% to 8% range. And so we feel very good about that. Now, when you talk about the small business and enterprises that's outside of the utility, that's really the big piece that you're referring to here. And all we're saying is we've got a nice steady pattern of profit contribution from that group and this plan. But it is a nice upside opportunity, because our view \u2013 and we might be wrong \u2013 but our view is that we will see capacity prices reach points where they will be a little higher than this $3 zone that we're in today, the $3 to $4 zone, and we'll be able to take advantage of that and help people. So we see that as an upside that's not in our plan. We think when we don't know something and we can't count on it, we just don't build it into our plan. We're pretty old fashioned that way. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So said otherwise, you're not banking on any improvement and the 6% to 8% \u2013 if prices were to stay in this $3 range, that is your assumption just said differently? Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Yeah. Or I'll say it my way because I know you're asking a little bit different. We really do believe in the 6% to 8% growth. And we believe that there are opportunities to do better than that. We may have chances to plough it right back into our business for our customers as you've seen us do for some time, because new things happen. And if there are things we can do for our customers, that makes either their prices better or their service better, we're going to go for it. And still let you have the 6% to 8%. So I know Julien, you don't want to hear this, but we don't see a plan where you would expect to see our growth above 6% to 8%. And if that's not good news, that's just the way we think. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. That's great. And then, quickly following up on the other side of the equation here the dividend. How are you thinking about that in the context of this higher growth rate? And I suppose just to frame it, you've talked about outsized dividend growth relative to earnings at least in the past, how do you think about that now? John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think part of the dividend increase, we've been very clear. We expect the dividend increase to grow with the growth of the company. So when we talk about outsized or larger, it's larger than what most in the industry increase. But as far as the payout ratio, it's very \u2013 it's right at the level that we want to be at. So at the end of the day, I expect the future dividend increase to grow with our 6% to 8% guidance in 2017 or 5% to 6% guidance in 2016. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Great. Well, thank you very much for taking the time. John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company : Thank you, Julien. Much appreciated. Operator : And thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Presenters, I turn the call back to you. John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. Thank you. Well, thanks everybody for joining us today. We really appreciate it. We appreciate your interest in the company. And for those of you that we have the opportunity to meet with, the three of us, Tom and Patti and I'll be in Boston, New York, next week to talk further about the company and where we're going. So, thank you for joining us today. Appreciate it. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on the CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations' section. [Operator Instructions]. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. DV Rao, Vice President and Treasurer, Financial Planning, Investor Relations Venkat Dhenuvakonda Rao : Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer; Patti Poppe, Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission and Incoming CEO and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer This presentation contains forward looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and also posted in our website. Now let me turn the call over to John. John Russell : Thanks DV. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. I will begin the presentation with a review of our first quarter and operating performances before turning the call over to Patti to discuss our capital investment plan and cost reduction initiatives. Then, Tom will provide the financial results and outlook and we will close with Q&A. First quarter earnings were $0.59 per share down $0.14 from a year ago. Weather was the primary factor. The mild weather that began last October continued through March resulting in the second warmest winter on record. On a weather normalized basis first quarter earnings were up $0.12 or 20% compared to last year and as you would expect we've already taken steps to mitigate the unfavorable weather impacts. That in time we will talk more about our plans later. But today we are reaffirming our full-year earnings guidance of a $1.99 to $2.02 a share. Earlier this month we retired seven coal plants totaling 950MW bringing our capacity mix to less than 25% coal, our regular and routine rate case strategy remains on track. Last week the commission approved a gas rate case settlement for $40 million, using the previously approved return on equity when required. We filed an electric rate case the 1st of March for $225 million and plan to self-implement later this year. We continue to operate with a constructive energy law, the framework allows for fair and timely regulatory treatment. If the law is updated we see this as being incrementally positive to our customers. With the recent coal plant closures we are proud of the fact that we have reduced the most coal capacity of any investor owned utility. The gas-fired Jackson generating station and new wind farms have been added to our portfolio making our capacity mix more sustainable. Additionally, we continue to offer energy efficiency programs which reduced demand 1% annually. This strategy puts us in a good position to meet future carbon reduction requirements and as I always enjoy saying the air is cleaner today in Michigan than it's ever been in my lifetime. Our regulatory track record is among the best in the nation. Over the last five years we have filed gas and electric cases to recover capital investments and pass along O&M savings to our customers. This has been the foundation of our sustainable business model for the past decade. In some years ago our O&M reductions fully offset our capital investment needs and we were able to avoid three rate cases. During this time the ROE has remained unchanged at a competitive 10.3% for gas and electric. The latest gas rate case was the fourth consecutive one that we have settled dating back to 2011. The current energy law in Michigan is working well. It allows us to execute our business plan while making needed infrastructure investments and providing energy savings programs to our customers. However, the law still requires that 99.98% of our customers subsidize about 300 large customers. This is simply not fair. We believe that updates to the law would be beneficial to our customers by securing reliable capacity and reducing rates. This is an opportunity for our legislatures and we will work with them on constructive updates. Whether or not the legislators decide to act we will continue our plan with the current law in place and move to 6% to 8% earnings growth for 2017 and beyond. There are many external factors that can affect our operational and financial results but we work through everything and work with everyone. We remain focused on delivering the consistent and predictable results that you have come to expect. It has been an honor and a privilege for me to lead the team that has delivered these results over the past six years. I believe the company is better today than it has ever been both financially and operationally with a very bright future. Now, let me turn the call over to Patti who will lead the execution of our model. Patti Poppe : Thank you, John and especially thank you for your leadership and your contribution to our company over your entire career. CMS Energy is definitely better than when you took the helm as CEO and President and if I do my math correctly we're talking about $8 billion better under your watch proof positive that you walk the talk and follow your motto to leave a better than you found it. John Russell : Thank you. Patti Poppe : One of the reasons that we are all optimistic that we will continue to get better is our capital investment in our gas and electric utility. As we said over the next 10 years we plan to invest $17 billion and that is a 60% increase over what we invested in the prior years. Each project is screened to ensure that will in fact add customer value. The customer value takes a form of customer service, reducing costs, enhancing our productivity, enabling cleaner energy, all of these improvements drive customer value and in fact many of the investments provide improvements in several of these categories. For examples, our customers benefit with fewer and shorter outages when we make our investment in our electric infrastructure. That not only improves the customer experience but reduces costs. Our customers benefit when they can move into the college apartments hook up to consumers energy service online on their mobile phone and never speak to a customer service rep and because of our smart energy and smart meter investment we can remotely turn on their power. No truck role [ph] required . This not only improves the customer experience end to end but fundamentally reduces the structural cost to do so. Our Smart Energy program is a great example of a major capital investment that has ongoing benefits to customers on both the service and the cost side of the equation. Other cost savings are driven by proactively investing in replacement of legacy gas service lines so that we can prevent an unscheduled maintenance expense and customer disruption. Our gas compression upgrades and the use of field technology allow for a more productive workforce and less unplanned expense. And with our ongoing transition from coal to gas and our increasing renewable energy investments we demonstrate to our customers every day that CMS Energy is in fact a great steward of our Great Lake state. Now you all know this model has been working for a long time, it has delivered results for more than a decade and the approach continues now and into years to come with our extensive inventory of our self-funded organic capital investment projects and really importantly offset by an abundant cost reduction opportunities. In a diverse economy you can see why it works especially with the continued focus on our cost reductions which I will talk a little bit more about. We have been a leader in this area and each year we come up with new and innovative ways to deliver those savings to our customers. For investors that means we are able to create CapEx headroom and at the same time fulfill our internal commitment to keep those base rate increases below inflation. Cost reductions have been and continue to be an important part of our self-funded model that we don't cherry pick this when we put all the numbers together. We take the bad with the good, we don't adjust for inflation or things out of our control and in the past several years our focus has delivered an average of 3% savings and we have a plan, a well-articulated plan to execute another 6% in savings over the next two years. I'll give you a little more detail on that. In fact I'm often asked if we can continue our performance and this is how I see it. When we look at our total O&M cost per customer we look great and in fact we\u2019re among the best of all utilities but when I dig deep and look into our distribution numbers we can see that we are still only in the third quartile. So for both electric and gas distribution there is more room. And in fact when they make up a third of our total O&M expense we know there's more opportunity there. For example when we go to a job site only 70% of the time do we build that job per plan. That means that the raw materials was probably ordered maybe too much, maybe too little. The right equipment may not be available and the right crew makeup may cause a delay. We can eliminate that waste and reduce expense by proving our first time quality and standardization. More broadly we\u2019re embarking on a companywide improvement effort and each day real savings are materializing. This approach to our first time quality is a value creation mechanism that enables for us continued cost reductions and at the same time deliver our 6% to 8% EPS growth in 2017 and beyond and at the same time improve our customer experience and keep it affordable. As I look around I see opportunities throughout the whole company. We have an established track record upon which we can build new and innovative ways to serve our customers at lower structural cost and I'm both realistic and enthusiastic about what the future holds for CMS. Now let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Webb : Thanks, Patti. Thank you everybody for joining us today on this very busy day. This is my 54th quarterly CMS earnings call and as usual no surprises. Our first quarter earnings are down $0.14 reflecting the cold winter last year and mild weather this year. On a weather normalized basis 2016 earnings are up $0.12 or 20%. Weather normalized all operations the gas utility electric utility, enterprises interest and other were at or all favorable to plan in 2015. You can see the unfavorable comparison of 2016 to 2015 weather on this waterfall chart. Our operations are performing well better than planned which offsets the weather in the first quarter of 2016. For the nine months ago if we experience just normal weather we will be $0.16 ahead of 2015 and that\u2019s when milder conditions existed. Cost reductions already under way keep us right on track for 5% to 7% earnings-per-share growth. Here is how the earnings-per-share forecast curve looked last year. We were able to reinvest $38 million into the business for our customers because cost reductions were better than planned and the 2014-2015 winter was cold. Towards the end of year the warm winter of 2015-2016 began but we fully offset delivering our 13th year of consistent EPS growth at 7%. This slide adds our forecast of EPS growth for 2016, as mentioned adverse weather in 2016 has been offset fully. The winter of 2015 to 2016 was the second warmest ever not even this however dense our ability to deliver 5% to 7% growth without any customer compromises. For example, we were able to enhance cost reductions including normal changes that come with mild weather like lower uncollectible accounts because customer bills are actually lower. In late December with 2015 cash flow better than expected we made a pension contribution improving profit two pennies for 2016. While the improvement program similar to the capitalization of [indiscernible] harding work are $0.03 better than planned. We also adopted a new approach for applying the interest rates to determine the interest cost on pension and healthcare obligations. This was worth a nickel. This new approach was permitted by a favorable SEC interpretation of a proposal by AT&T just last year. The use of this PBO weighted application of interest rates reduces volatility and it improved earnings in 2016. Each year of pension obligations is actually discounted by its yield curve rate as though it had its own pension plan. Instead of the conventional approach of waiting all years by the same average interest rate as shown in orange on the slide, this new approach shown in green reduces the cost of interest in the near end year's partly offset by higher cost in far out years. For a defined benefits program like ours one that we closed about 10 years ago the advantage has heightened and our volatile is reduced. We're big fans of lower volatility at CMS. This new approach produced and earnings improvement of a nickel a share in 2016 which helped to offset the abnormal weather. Here is a look at our EPS curve for the last couple years. You can see every year is different but we have always delivered 7% EPS growth by managing the business on behalf of customers and investors. Over the last three years, we reinvested $238 million into customer improvements. Half from favorable weather and half from higher than planned cost savings. Yes, that\u2019s worth repeating. We reinvested in O&M $238 million for our customers and we delivered 7% earnings growth. Most of you are aware of the recent one-year MISO capacity auction for Zone 7. Capacity cost were $2.19 a kilowatt month which is about a quarter of the cost of building new capacity. This however had little direct impact on our business -- Tesla in the garage the Dearborn Industrial Generation facility. Most of our 2017 contracts are bilateral and were in place before the auction. New contracts completed by March added $50 million to our profitability for 2017 increasing big profit to $35 million, a nice lift towards the 6% to 8% growth guidance for 2017. We still have outside opportunities including 25% of the big energy and 50% to 90% of capacity depending on the year still available for 2018 and beyond. The MISO capacity auction results were close to being a $1 or more higher incentivizing bilateral customers to pay a bit more to reduce their risk. This could add $20 million to $40 million of profit in the future. As you can see on our sensitivity table that we provide each quarter risk are not large and mitigation to minimize our exposure continues to be robust. Last month, Fitch upgraded the utility rating two notches and the parent rating a notch. Moody's put the utility and the parent on a positive outlook, it's nice to see the agencies recognizing our balance sheet and business model strength. For the year, we are at or above all of our financial targets. From investments to cash flow to customer prices, the dividend and EPS growth we expect strong performance again this year. Our business model continues to work well, self-funding most of our capital investments for customers leaving rate increases at or below the level of inflation. This model is focused on decisions that benefit customers and investors. This permits performance that is sustainable continuing our track record of consistent high end results for nearly 15 years. Patti and I look forward to continuing this track record together and John it's a pleasure to have done six years of these calls with the best CEO in the business. John Russell : Thank you. Tom Webb : Thank you for being a good friend. John Russell : Thank you. Tom Webb : So let's take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Paul Ridzon : I just had a quick question with the legislation having been introduced into the Senate, is there any read through that maybe some common ground has been found with the Chamber of Commerce and the schools? John Russell : The fact that it's been introduced I think it's a positive. I think you know there's been discussion going on with the schools and the chamber about supporting this bill or the ones from the house. The bills that came out for everybody to know their bill is introduced. I just set the groundwork the bills were introduced, two of them substitute bills in the Senate, Energy Committee yesterday and they refocused on the things we talked about before. Senator [indiscernible] had to do with retail open access, 10% cap stays but the suppliers need to have firm forward capacity in Michigan and any further new ROA customer would have to pay a capacity charge. So we think that even though it would be nice to get to a fully regulated entity that seems to be reasonable. Part of that was integrated resource plan which is good for preapproved generation cost and regulatory there are some changes there which is good for I think everybody including us. The chamber needs to decide what they want to do with these. At the end of the day as I said earlier it's an unfair system in Michigan that we had today were 300 customers of our 1.8 million customers benefit and our 99.98% of the customers pay 3% to 4% more on the cost to subsidize these other customers. So I think what [indiscernible] is doing is the right thing but let's get the senate bill out, get it through the senate and try to get as much support as we possibly can. As far as the schools are concerned the same thing, few schools take choice, most of them don't. At the end of the day they pay more, at chamber few of their customers take choice, most of them don't, they pay more. So I hope both of those organizations will be on the right side of this. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Paul Patterson : I also just wanted to sort of touch base on the legislation. When you have a bunch of people who are subsidized often they can be pretty effective in blocking things and the legislation hasn't been going as quickly as you might have expected earlier. And I'm just wondering any sense about that? I mean you did sort of address it with Paul Ridzon just now but I mean how do you guys feel about it's chances of passing I guess at this point? John Russell : You raise a great point about those that haven't want to continue it and again if I was subsidized I would want to continue it to, so that has been the battle. The issue is that it's just not fair to our customers. And as we shut down seven coal plants and there was other plant closed in Michigan you see the results of the MISO auction that Tom talked about, it's beginning to show that we may have capacity tightening up and if we do that means that new supply along with energy efficiency needs to be combined and moved forward. Well in the most capital intensive industry in the world with the most volatile product in the world it's hard to make investments unless you have uncertainty and that\u2019s what the law I think the law is trying to provide and I think that\u2019s what Senator [indiscernible] primary view is reliability and certainty going forward. Can a handicap weather is going to get through it or not? I think it will get through the senate, I'm pretty confident about that. My opinion is it's get more of a challenge in the house and that\u2019s something that we have seen before. So I don\u2019t really want to handicap it right now, if we get it I think it would be an upside but I do want to emphasize that we\u2019re not counting on any law changes to our 10 plan, not our five year plan but our 10 year plan and as Patti has taken over, she is growing the business to 6% to 8%, her and Tom, I think that\u2019s great and none of is dependent on the law changes. So if the law does change it's good for our customers and there maybe some upside to us but that really is the intent that we are focused on is what's fair for our customers and I think some of the issues that many of you will be talking about in the next few minutes in Ohio is a good indication of what should not happen here in Michigan. Paul Patterson : And then just on the pension, what's the full-year impact I mean just the impact going forward on this $0.05 and what have you? I'm sorry to be so slow on it but I wasn\u2019t particularly clear. John Russell : So the $0.05 is the positive impact from the change in how we calculate the interest on pension and healthcare cost. So I don't want that to sound like it's just a first quarter paper thing, that\u2019s the full-year impact. You still have other impacts and things like remember the discount rate still moves up and down so that could change things next year, it could give you little good news, little bit of bad news. The $0.05 for that change is the full-year effect. In the future we will remeasure that each year in January but what we think we have done is taken volatility out of that particular calculation but you still could have -- I'm going to go to the big side of penny or maybe two up or down but less than what we\u2019ve looked at in the past. Paul Patterson : And then just on sales growth, weather adjusted, leap year adjusted, what was it for the quarter? John Russell : So our sales on the quarter were flat but here is what's interesting. When you look at the weather normalized sales, we actually are showing in our reports which you can look at attached to the release that residential and commercial are down about 2%. I will tell you I actually don\u2019t believe that, I don\u2019t think we have weather adjusted year-to-year correctly. Last year the first quarter was very cold and we said our residential and commercial sales were like 2% up. Now we are comparing to that where it was really mild and we\u2019re saying 2% down. What we saw in the second quarter last year was that sort of reversed, it just said oops, your weather calculations aren't too good. I think we probably see that in this year. I hate to dismiss data but I just don't believe that follow-off in residential and commercial will continue but I do believe if you look forward think of those as kind of flat. We are not seeing great growth there. It's the industrial side that is interesting, our industrial side was up 5% and if you take one customer out we were actually up 9% in the first quarter. So there is a lot of good news in there. The food business was up about 4% and plastic sector up about 4%, transportation up about 7%, packaging up about 10% and here's something that I really like to see several of our companies in the building sector were up a lot. Cement side was about 17% so there is a lot going on where we can see the uplift through industrial, but keep in mind we are conservative beast, we\u2019re still telling you that for the year as we go out we're looking for about 1% growth overall but I will admit the bulk of that will be on the industrial side. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So perhaps just a quick question on that [indiscernible] there, can you comment a little bit on what you are saying in the future? Obviously we have seen some improvement in that pricing and obviously it doesn't move the needle too much. How do you think about layering in your expectation going forward whether that\u2019s status quo or backward ratio [ph] or what have you? And then also your existing contracts and ultimately the earnings profile of our multiyear period? I will leave it there. John Russell : Let me take those in a couple of pieces. First of all we gave you a little bit of good showing that for 2017 the layering and that\u2019s a good way to think about how these capacity contracts are being put in, a little bit more good news layered in, a little bit more good news layered in with contracts. We are not trying to grab what we think is a peak or rush to anything. We will miss the peak and we will miss the trough but the layering strategy should give us some good news. So I would say the $35 million number is pretty good for 2017 for the chart we showed you, we still have about 25% of our energy and our capacity available so there is some more upticks that could come from that. Now go to the future. As you look at further in time we have anywhere starting in 2018 out through time and near time 50% to 90% of capacity and still 25% of energy because we have got some nice long term contracts in place on energy. I don't want to predict how much of the $20 million to $40 million upside will happen except to say because we layer in, I don't think you should expect the full $40 million. That would be getting to the replacement cost. But on the other hand, I'm not so negative as to say it will only grow by another $20 million. So I think what we're trying to do is give you the zone somewhere in between there that we honestly believe will be achieved depending on the prices and the bilateral demand and what we are able to do as a business. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And to be explicit about your going forward expectations on where these auction results go out, what do you think of these reforms in terms of impacts on pricing? John Russell : Nice and complicated is what they are. So what we are going to see going forward as MISO is going to be changing the seasonal auctions, they are going to be and changing to multiyear auctions and I wouldn't even fathom a guess about what that will really mean but what we can look at is the data that just occurred. That $2.19 per kilowatt month if you laid the bids down right along the demand line and you all can see this it's all public record, you can see that it stays pretty close in there. So with a modest change of what was happening in the market on the demand side that could had easily have been $3 plus. So what that does to people that are interested in reducing their volatility, they come to businesses like the Tesla, the Ferrari or dig [ph] whatever we want to call it, they will come there looking for ways to take out volatility and pay a little higher price than the auction, those the one-year auctions at least to protect themselves from an exposure. So I do see a little upside from that based on that and the bigger picture is, it's telling you a little bit about what John talked to. That capacity situation for Zone 7 is just not all that solid. So as changes occur in demand or in the supply side I think that you see a market that could tighten up quite a bit and it is very hard to predict but a year from now I just suspect it will probably be a tighter market on capacity. Now that\u2019s just a personal opinion. So I will leave it at that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And actually that teases pretty well into the next question. I was curious as you think about your portfolio of PPAs including some of the higher-priced PPAs, is there any ability to potentially step in a little bit earlier to try to come to some resolution on bringing down those cost for consumers by extracting yourself from some of those obligations? Specifically Palisade [ph] is what I am thinking. John Russell : I am shocked. So there is a lot of speculation going on that subject but all I can tell you that\u2019s the sort of thing that we just don't want to comment on. So I just like to leave that open to see what happens. It's very important that the owners control that and so we don't want to do any speculation. I hope you will appreciate that. Operator : And I'm showing there are no further questions at this time. John Russell : All right. Let me close it out. First of all thank you for joining us today. As Tom said I know it is a very busy reporting day and this will be a quick call. Also I want to thank all of you that are on the line right now for all of your help, support and I will miss all of you as my tenure and as CEO and Patti will head up and Tom will head up the next call without me. So my thanks to all of you. It has been a great run and the company is in great hands moving forward. So thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on the CMS Energy's website in the investor relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer-session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 1 PM Eastern time, Monday through August 4. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the investor relations section.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. DV Rao, Vice President and Treasurer, Financial Planning and Investor Relations. Venkat Dhenuvakonda Rao : Thanks Tiffany, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and also posted in our website. Now let me turn the call over to Patti. Patti Poppe : Thanks DV. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. I will begin the presentation with a review of our second quarter results, the progress made on our first half checklist and I\u2019ll share a little bit more with you about our Consumers Energy Way. Tom will then provide the financial results and outlook and will wrap up with Q&A. Second quarter earnings were $0.45 per share, up $0.20 from a year ago, on a weather normalized basis earnings were up $0.14 or 52%. We are proud of our results and they were driven primarily by our outstanding operational performance. The cost controls and other good business decisions we put in place earlier in the year had a positive impact for this quarter. Today, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02 per share. For 2017 and beyond as we previously announced, we plan to grow adjusted earnings per share at 6% to 8% annually. Let\u2019s go through our first half checklist.  We\u2019ve made good progress achieving our financial and operational objective, the last 6 months were no different than the last 13 years, focused on delivering results for our customers and our investors. Michigan\u2019s track record of constructive regulation continues with the appointment of the new commissioner and our 8-K strategy is on track and focused on recovering capital investments through routine and regular rate cases. We\u2019ve been a leader in the transition to clean our environment and in April we retired seven baseload coal plants that have generating power dependably and affordably for over 60 years. A change like that is not easy, but the way we care for our people and our communities during the transition makes it a very positive step towards a sustainable energy future. Recently, we launched a new initiative of continuous improvement that we call the Consumers Energy Way. I am excited about the customer focus benefits and waste elimination this program will deliver over the next several years. And then finally, the Michigan Legislature broke for the summer recess without taking action on the energy bill although the reforms would be positive for our customers as we have consistently reiterated we are not counting on any changes in our long-term financial plan as a result of the new law. We are pleased with the appointment of Commissioner Rachel Eubanks. Her education and financial experience will be nice addition to an already strong commission and we look forward to working with her. Electric and gas infrastructure investment is needed throughout the state and by working with Michingan\u2019s agency for energy and our commission to prioritize those investments, together we can assure that the benefits for customers and the state will be realized in a well planned fashion. We plan to self implement our electric rate increase of $170 million on September 1st at the current authorized 10.3% return-on-equity. The staff has recommended a $92 million revenue increase based on a 10% ROE. Half of the difference between our self implementation amount and the staff\u2019s position is the ROE and cost-of-capital adjustments. On August 1st, we plan to file a $90 million gas case, 93% of this case is made up of new investments to strengthen infrastructure and improve system capacity and deliverability.  As the fourth largest combination utility, the strength of our gas and electric businesses together is a balanced mix that serves the people of Michigan and our investors well. We are very fortunate to be in this desirable position. Reducing coal dependency is a strategy on which we\u2019ve been focused for several years. A recent example of this was the shutdown of the classic seven coal plants that I mentioned earlier with thoughtful planning years in advance, we were able to keep our promises to employees, vocal communities and Michigan\u2019s beautiful natural resources. Having reduced our coal generation more than any other investor on utility, we are leaving it better than we found it. As we continue to plan and look for additional ways to reduce our coal dependency and become an even more sustainable energy company. Another critical step we\u2019re taking to assure sustainable performance is the roll-out of our Consumers Energy Way. For the past couple of months, our executives, directors and managers have all attended intensive training that will help them to identify the most efficient operational standard and ways to eliminate waste. After talking with each and everyone of them, I am further convinced that we can continue improving our customer experience and reducing costs for years to come. The next decade of extraordinary outcomes will be achieved by a strategy of working safely, completing work right in the first time, at the lowest cost and on schedule.  We will continue to improve and deliver results for our customers and our investors. One area where I see more opportunity to improve specifically is distribution cost performance and we have a plan to do that. By reducing our total electric distribution cost by $30 million, we would be in first quartile and for $70 million we can make it all the way to the top of the list. The Consumers Energy Way is the strategy that will help us realize that goal all the while improving our customers experience and satisfaction. The future performance of CMS Energy is bright and sustainable, the Consumers Energy Way will allow us to drive continuous improvement to achieve and maintain a high level of operational performance. My co-workers and I will eliminate non-value added activities and replace them with higher value offerings for customers and more certain financial results for our investors. By creating a culture of continuous improvement, every person, every job, everyday and every customer touch point can improve.  With a track record like us, it\u2019s hard to expect more but we have a plan and strategy to do just that. Our commitment to extraordinary outcomes in all areas of our business enables our previously announced move to 6% to 8% adjusted earnings growth beginning next year and that continues year after year after year. Now, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Webb : Thanks Patti. Second quarter results at $0.45 were up $0.20 compared with the year ago and on a weather or normalized basis up $0.14. This is substantially better than our original plan more than offsetting the adverse weather in the first quarter. For the first half overall, our earnings were $1 for a share up $0.10 or 11% from plan. Now as you can see here, while our first quarter results were down $0.14 from the same period in 2015, we more than offset that with our performance in the second quarter which is up $0.20. The weather helped a bit as did the expected impact of approved rates. In addition, we reached a settlement with the Michigan Treasury on used taxes, a nice $0.03 uplift.  As you would expect, we also improved our O&M cost compared with the year ago by $0.09 in the second quarter. This reflects benefit gains, better run collectable account performance, all plant closures and a variety of other solid operating improvements. Looking ahead into the second half, if weather is just normal, we\u2019ll accomplish a nice uptick of $0.13 compared with 2015. As you may know, we already have a headstart on the third quarter with hot and muggy weather in July. Even with that or even without that, we would have plenty of room for growing infrastructure investments and we continue to project 5% to 7% earnings per share growth with solid confidence.  I know most of you are well acquainted with the concept of this slide, where we show our projected earnings per share growth for the full year as the year progresses. During the first quarter, mild winter weather and abnormal storms reduced our earnings per share outlook by $0.13 but in a short period of time we were right back on track with earnings growth in the 5% to 7% range. You can see the improvements that offset abnormal weather in the lower box on this slide.  We are ahead of our guidance and as always will put that upside to work for our customers and will deliver consistent pure leading EPS growth. We\u2019ve delivered 7% adjusted EPS growth for almost 15 years. Here is the picture of our track record for just the last 5 of those years, it shows how we consistently offset bad news and put good news to use for our customers without compromising our predictable earnings growth of 7% each and every year. Over the last 3 years, favorable weather and cost reductions in excess of our plan generated room to invest a quarter of a billion dollars for our customers, half from weather and half from cost productivity better than planned. That\u2019s a big number, we put these savings to work in many, many beneficial ways.  Turning to 2017 and the future, here is our business model which is pretty simple and maybe just a little unique. We\u2019re fortunate to have a lot of capital investment opportunities over the next 10 years as we catch up on projects we didn\u2019t do over the prior 10 years. This investment in reliability, cost improvements, environmental mandates and other areas grows by about 6 to 8% a year, perhaps what\u2019s unique about our model is that we self fund the bulk of the investment increase keeping our customer base rate growth at or below the level of inflation. That discipline provides a real rate reduction for our customers as we make substantial improvements on their behalf. Over the next 10 years, we\u2019ll invest over $17 billion in both our electric and gas businesses as shown in the circle on the left. 37% of this investment is in our growing gas business which already is the fourth largest in the nation. What\u2019s important is that all of these investments add tremendous value for our customers, whether it\u2019s exceeding compliance requirements for clean energy, enhancing productivity, reducing costs or improving our service. And we have opportunities to increase spending further on infrastructure as well as replacing large PPAs. We can build new capacity cheaper than existing PPA contracts, opportunities around these items could be in the $3 to $4 billion range. Part of the secret sauce as Patti mentioned is being able to reduce our O&M cost to help funding investment. We prefer annual rate cases because they are simple and manageable and they provide us with the opportunity to share our cost reductions with our customers as we gain recovery for capital investment programs, you can see our plans on the right. We are constantly refining including sizing ourselves to demand, for example we\u2019re in the middle of a voluntary separation program to enhance the phase of savings in a manner that treats our colleagues in a fair and respectful way. Net of cost increases, our cost reduction will be $60 million or about 3% a year over 2016 and 2017. That\u2019s consistent with our prior performance as shown on the left where we reduced our O&M cost by almost 3% on average each year since 2016. It\u2019s a program we\u2019re proud off and one that we can continue for many years as we take advantage of solid business decisions and better processes that we describe as the Consumers Energy Way.  In addition to our cost performance, our conservative yield sales growth and our ability to avoid new dilutive equity, we still have attractive upsides outside of the utility. As you can see in this slide, continued layering in of the energy and capacity sales could enable us to increase our profitability by $20 to $40 million at our Dearborn industrial generation operations, you call that DIG. This is a nice insurance policy for our utility and a catalyst for new growth and by the way today we\u2019re celebrating 10 years without a safety incident at DIG, Safe and excellent operations are the foundation of our success. Now, here is our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity slide to help you with your assessment of our future performance. I know there is a lot of concerns around the sector about the impact of low interest rates on pension and benefit obligations. A 50 basis points drop could be worth about a $12 million hit to earnings for us, lower debt cost however would offset much of that and should we make a pension contribution of say a $100 million that would offset the rest and then so we do not see a major interest rate concern for us. The world changes every day and our model is built on being prepared to mitigate or take advantage of changes as they occur. Brexit from the European Union which I think surprised a lot of us last month has sure surprised me is a good example. It created opportunities to issue more debt at even lower interest rates, it also added to uncertainty, one of the reasons that we keep a little thicker liquidity levels than most of our peers. For example in May, before Brexit we extended our five year revolvers another year. Our liquidity including these revolves is over 15% of our market cap and that\u2019s a bit thicker than the average of our peers.  And here is our report card, we are right on course to achieve our plans for capital investment, high quality balance sheet, competitive customer prices, a robust dividend payout, strong operating cash flow and adjusted earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% range. We are pleased to have been able to deliver consistent strong earnings growth for 14 years and we intend to continue this for a long time. Our earnings and dividend growth continue at a consistent type pace every year no matter what\u2019s happening in the economy, the weather, politics or succession planning. So thank you for your interest and your support, we\u2019re deeply grateful for it and we\u2019d be delighted to take your questions. So Tiffany would you be kind enough to open the lines. Operator : Thank you very much Mr. Webb. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin with UBS. Your line is open. Tom Webb : Good morning Julien. Julien Dumoulin : Hi, good morning. So perhaps first quick question, congrats on the results but could you elaborate a little bit on the continuous improvement efforts you guys have emphasized voluntary separations, et cetera? Where do you stand relative to plan on a multi-year basis? Clearly, given how well you're doing this year, what are the thoughts in the back half of the year on O&M tracks? Patti Poppe : Well Julien, thanks for the question because it obviously is an area of real focus for us. We feel great about the relative performance to plan, obviously and that\u2019s reflected in our results but as we look forward to the year for the balance of this year, we really are continuing to everyday improve our processes and our operations so that we eliminate the waste of rework, the waste of return visits et cetera and every time we do that, it\u2019s a cost saving. So we have those cost savings built into this year\u2019s plan and we continue to execute on that plan. I would also say on the VSP, the VSP is a culmination of many years of working on productivity improvements and I would say that our recent launch of the Consumers Energy Way is probably too early in its life to attribute to the VSP, but it\u2019s always important to write size and match our workload with our workforce and through a voluntary program like this, we\u2019ve enabled employees to optionally decide to retire early which then set us up for great performance next year where we have our workforce and the workload lined up. Tom Webb : So dealing in one of the thoughts. Julien Dumoulin : So bottom line, it's a rate reflective. Tom Webb : It is, but Julien also keep in mind the part you don\u2019t want to hear as we do more and more this year, we\u2019ll put that surplus cost improvement to work but more reliability and all that good stuff but what it does for us is gives us headrooms, so it allows us to fit in more investment. Julien Dumoulin : Right. Absolutely. Second question, on the legislative angle, can you comment more broadly? If you are unable to get comprehensive legislation, have you guys thought to doing something a little bit more specific or tactical? Would be curious if there is potentially a new avenue for something more specific. Patti Poppe : I would say that first-of-all again the changes to the energy policy are not embedded in our plan but what we do think is important for the state to address is the idea that alternative energy suppliers don\u2019t have to demonstrate that they have firm capacity. And through Micel\u2019s recent 3 year forward looking capacity auction proposals will be curious and observing and we have filed comments that when they make their filing with the FERC in mid-August, we\u2019ll have a better indicator of some of the changes that they are recommending will in fact be a way to help address that loophole where people can sell power that they don\u2019t actually have. We want to make sure that gets fixed or show reliability and resource adequacy in Michigan. Julien Dumoulin : Got it. All right, thank you. Patti Poppe : Thanks Julien. Operator : Your next comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. You line is open. Ali Agha : Thank you, good morning. Patti Poppe : Hi Ali, good morning. Ali Agha : First, Tom, can you just elaborate a little bit on this tax settlement you referred to? Was that just a Q2 event? Will that have lingering impacts over the course of the year? How should we be thinking about that? Tom Webb : So the tax settlement was around used taxes and is something we\u2019ve been working on for gosh it\u2019s almost a decade and a half and the way I would ask you to think about that, that\u2019s a nice benefit that we\u2019re glad to have this year because it was worth $0.03 in this quarter, but it\u2019s a onetime thing. There is a little bit of a benefit going forward but it\u2019s not big enough that you should get excited about it, right. So what we do is we\u2019re looking at that, that\u2019s a nice offset to the onetime bad weather that we had in the first quarter. So it kind of lines up and gives you a good quality of earnings. So we\u2019re glad to have it, it\u2019s been a long time coming and we\u2019re delighted that the Michigan Treasury is happy and so are we. Ali Agha : Okay. The second question you referred to the low interest rates and the implications of that. Just thinking of that from another vantage point, one of the positives in Michigan from a regulatory perspective is that your authorized ROEs are above industry average and have been very consistent. Just wondering, in this persistent low interest rate environment, are you getting any sense that there may be pressure on authorized ROEs or is your sense that the regulators still remain very comfortable with where they are at? Tom Webb : I don\u2019t want to speak for the regulators but I would say this is that when you look at the authorized ROEs including riders and things that people have, we\u2019re really not that far out of line with the better performing utilities around the country. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that special of the thing and then I\u2019d also agree, there is interest rates come down and puts pressure on where those numbers should be. You can see by our request in both of our rate cases, that we think that there is something between where we\u2019re asking and where the staff often would be that there is kind of a middle point in there that\u2019s around that 10.3%. So we\u2019re hopeful that they see the usefulness and importance of that and the competitiveness of that level and that could sustain. Ali Agha : Okay. And then thirdly, the goal to get to the top quartile you said another $30 million gets you there. How long do you think it takes you to get to that level? And then related to that, Tom the cost savings you laid out for 2016, 2017 over a long period of time, how much more can you say you can take out of the system to continue that very impressive cost reduction program? Patti Poppe : Ali, I\u2019ll answer the first part of the question. As we build our plan for run rate, our distribution cost and distribution cost per customer, I would, we see in past to mid to late 2018 gets us to the top quartile and then additional savings come from a sustained commitment to continuous improvement in waste elimination and so that\u2019s the time horizon we\u2019d be looking for the first quartile competitiveness. Tom Webb : Let me just then add to that because I know it\u2019s a good question that people do ask us and we ask ourselves. So if you look at that slide that talks about the O&M cost performance, you\u2019ll see a line and that is called the attrition for an example. And that line is nothing but we lose about 400 or so people each year through retirements in the like and when we bring somebody in to replace that with our new programs for defining contributions to the divine benefit and different healthcare for new employees. We save a good chunk of money, about 40,000 dollars with each turnover, till that time the 400 gets you into $16 million a year and that\u2019s 1.6% of our O&M right there all by itself. That sustains for good many years because we still have a large population of older guys like me, so there will be more people that take advantage of that over time and then I would say beyond smart meters and productivity and VSP programs and all that, what Patti has described that we\u2019re proud to talk about as the Consumers Energy Way, it provides a lot of opportunity that she has shown some specifics on it but it provides some opportunities in everything we do. It cuts into the finance organization and cuts into the back office, it isn\u2019t just the operating piece up front. We can be a lot better what we do smartly not paying for it. Ali Agha : Thank you. Patti Poppe : Thanks Ali. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Tom Webb : Good morning Paul. Patti Poppe : Good morning Paul. Paul Ridzon : Are you aware of anything going on behind the scenes in Lansing, so that we can hit the ground running in the lame-duck session? Patti Poppe : Well, we know of it, there will be conversations in the short window before the election when the senate comes back into session. We don\u2019t expect the house would take it up before that, but if the senate can come to some conclusions before the elections, then in that lame-duck its possible but I would say that we don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely. Paul Ridzon : Okay. And then what about into 2017? Patti Poppe : So then there are elections, you know implications of the elections this fall particularly in the house, there are a lot of seats up for grabs, there are some people who are predicting that the house could shift from public into democrat that would be a big change. Terms limits are real challenge in Michigan because it requires then all new legislators have to be briefed on a variety of subjects including this complicated one. So I doubt that they would hit the ground running, but certainly I would expect that we will be back at it come the start of the year. Tom Webb : Can I just add to that, as Patti said earlier, remember nothing of this new law whatever it might be is in our plan and we are pretty happy with the 2008 energy law, it gives us so many wonderful things that we can do. So its got to be good meaningful change when it occurs. Paul Ridzon : Got it, okay, thank you. Tom Webb : Thanks Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Weinstein : Hello, guys. Patti Poppe : Hi Michael. Michael Weinstein : Hello, Patti. When you were talking about competitive suppliers and the requirement to buy capacity for their customers, in the absence of those requirements though, I'm wondering, what does the energy and the capacity shortage or availability situation in the state look like over time? At what point in the future do you see the critical shortage of capacity in Michigan and in Zone 7, Zone 4? Patti Poppe : Well, so Zone 7 we see and it was recently published, a 300 megawatt shortfall in 2017 is the forecast that eats into the reserve margin pretty significantly and by 2021 up to doubling of that 600 megawatts was just the publicly announced plant closures as you know, DTE announced several closures recently. So that definitely is in the forecast, what\u2019s not in that forecast is any other early retirements of other units. So again we do think that it\u2019s a critical issue that needs to be addressed and we need to assure that the people who are selling power in Michigan have that power that they can actually provide the power they sold and so it does highlight the issue that exists in Zone 7 with this hybrid market. Michael Weinstein : I guess in the interim, if there is a shortage, how do you meet that shortage? Patti Poppe : While we are certainly able to cover the load of our customers where we have adequate supply and reserve margin to serve the 90% of the load in our service territory and so where we are covered. The question will be how the alternative providers cover. Now on a hot day when we have to deploy, there is a whole emergency set of procedures that MISO invokes across the entire region. If there are constraints on any given day and so there is a whole procedure to manage that obviously all the peakers come on and everyone is required to ramp up everything they\u2018ve got and then we dial download purposely that as the programs with those customers allow demand response et cetera. So that\u2019s obviously important part of the mix as well. Tom Webb : There is only a couple of IPPs left and we\u2019re one of them called DIG. So it puts us in a good spot to back up the utility so that we do what\u2019s needed there and it also puts a statement in the spot having that bit of an insurance policy, but we all agree, it\u2019s something that needs to be addressed and we have more certainty going forward. Michael Weinstein : Would it be accurate to say that on slide 18 when you talk about the $4.50 to $7.50 possibilities going-forward capacity, is that the high-end of that range, would be a shortage condition where there is no other solution; DIG just is the solution to serving the region? Tom Webb : Yeah, I\u2019d say what we see in the market as we do bilateral market sales, the upside opportunities between 450 and 750, you might sell a little bit at 750, but I wouldn\u2019t think of selling what\u2019s left there, that would be probably a more aggressive assumption that is realistic. So somewhere in between there is what could happen in the market, that will be opportunity for us. You\u2019ll note that we\u2019ve sold a lot of our energy, that just makes sense to do was long-term contracts out of DIG, but we\u2019ve held a lot of our capacity available one for the situation and two for insurance for our utility to make sure that we\u2019ve got backup. Patti Poppe : And if Michael does a 3 year forward-looking auction, it does give more visibility and these bilateral agreements then become more attractive depending on what that auction foretells. So I think a 3 year forward-looking capacity auction would be a good enabler to what Tom\u2019s describing. Michael Weinstein : Got you, thank you very much. Patti Poppe : Thank you. Tom Webb : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. Patti Poppe : Good morning Jonathan Tom Webb : Good morning. Jonathan Arnold : Two questions, you're $0.13 ahead, weather, so far. You alluded to the hot and muggy July. Can you give us a sense of what the through-July number might look like? And then, as well, what are you reinvesting in currently. What's the best way of deploying those extra dollars in the system. Is there a possibility you run out of stuff to do? Tom Webb : I\u2019d answer the last part and then ask everyone that they look at the slide towards the 2016 EPS outlook which is a little curvy chart. To your point Jonathan, there is a little box there that shows how we did the recovery. A lot of that\u2019s ongoing stuff and some of that\u2019s onetime things, you know like they used tax. And then you\u2019ll see that we saw our cells running up because we are doing better on our cost reductions then we anticipated so we are on the upside sort of with opportunities to reinvest more.  The weather side that you\u2019re asking about which is in addition to that, if you just took July for what we know for the months so far, there is $0.03, $0.04 of earnings upside associated with that. I am always cautious with those kind of numbers because what\u2019s August going to be like, $0.03 or $0.04 up again or down, we don\u2019t know, we just plan on normal weather and our projections. So where can we put that money to work over so many opportunities, we can pull some outage work ahead from next year into this year. That helps next year\u2019s results and helps our reliability, so we\u2019re looking at that.  We can do more on the tree-trimming side, that\u2019s probably the single biggest thing we can do to improve our reliability and so there is a place that we can do more work on and above and beyond what we\u2019ve been authorized to do by the Commission. There is also more esoteric things like low cost financing, if these rates continue to stay low, we can take a hard look and we can make these decisions sooner or later we can go pretty far back into the year and decide that let\u2019s just take on some more low interest debt and prefund some of our future debt and all that does is it might cost us a little bit for settling this year, there is the investment part, but it will save more money to create more profits, 17 and sometime forward years.  So I could go on because there is an awful long list, but those are some of the areas that are very practical and they are on our radar screen and we\u2019re looking at them and we\u2019re timing them in way that we think allows us to do the max performance for our customers and then not miss the earnings growth. Jonathan Arnold : Great, thank you Tom. And then, could you just remind us when, how far out your no-equity look currently is? Tom Webb : Yeah, I think we go out to 2021 and 2022 and there is in the appendix of your material, a slide that I will refer folks so that you wouldn\u2019t miss that, it\u2019s our operating cash flow slide, it\u2019s got a big got arrow flying over shown that we take out about or improve our operating cash flow about a 100 million a year and on the bottom box you can see our NOLs and credits in the yellow side and you can see they go out to 2021. So it will be 2021, 2022 before we\u2019re looking at meeting any block equity but I caution you again, 10 years running predicting that incorrectly, it could go out further. Jonathan Arnold : Fair enough. Alright. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Patti. Patti Poppe : Thanks Jonathan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Leslie Rich with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Leslie Rich : Good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning Leslie. Leslie Rich : Question on slide 13. You have $0.13 there attributable in part to pension yield curve and enhanced capitalization. Could you just walk through what that is? What the yield curve moving down why that's a benefit? Tom Webb : Yes, this is that new process that we put in place towards the beginning of this year, where it is looking at how you do your expenses when you\u2019re discounting the pension cost and what we\u2019re now doing is actually discounting if you will at the point of each year as opposed to an average of all the years. And by doing that, that actually gives us a better look at how to reflect on our programs. So it\u2019s like our designed benefit pension program where its closed, new employees aren\u2019t coming into that. So the bulk of our liability is more upfront than it is in the back. So by taking low interest rates in the curve early on, it\u2019s cheaper for us and of course as you go out in time and the curve rises above the average, it\u2019s a little more expensive.  But that\u2019s a big savings to us and it should as well as we go into the future years minimize the amount of volatility we have when we\u2019re looking at discount rates and the pension curve interest rates. And that\u2019s maybe why when I said earlier, the impact of 50 basis points on our pension plan on OPEB is only about $12 million, I know I heard that\u2019s a bigger number for some companies but it could be because the program has closed, new employees come into a DC program.  And then on the enhanced capitalization, all that is, that is just where we really should be capitalizing work we\u2019re doing instead of putting it in O&M. That allows our customers to get a better deal they pay for it later but its also a benefit for us as we do that because that\u2019s less O&M expenses and so that our profits are higher if you will.  So we\u2019re just doing a little more of that and one of the examples that you may recall, we\u2019ve used a few times in our slides called pole top maintenance and that\u2019s just where we do a little more complete work, complete when there is a storm, replacing a whole pole-top cross arms and the like instead of just doing bits and pieces. By doing the whole work, we get to capitalize it instead of count it as O&M and those are couple of good examples for us. Leslie Rich : Yes. That's great, thank you. Tom Webb : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie. Your line is open. Andrew Weisel : Hello, good morning everyone. Patti Poppe : Good morning. Andrew Weisel : First question is a follow up on DIG. It looks like you sold some more capacity in energy for 2017 and yet the outlook for expected income hasn't changed. So that basically just means that the prices were in line with your expectations or is there any other moving parts there? Tom Webb : No, no other moving parts whatsoever, good observation. It showed 25% last time and is at 0 now. That\u2019s around the energy side and we pretty much, it\u2019s a lot of that light blue bar that you see up there in \u201917. We had factored that in at the prices that we expected. So there was no big uptick in our numbers from that. Andrew Weisel : Okay. And then moving forward, you said you want to keep some, I forget if there was energy or capacity or both. Do you have a targeted amount of how much you\u2019d want to retain for those future years? Tom Webb : Well we\u2019re at a bit of a sweet spot right now. On energy, we have about 25% available as we go out in the future. Now, we\u2019ll be happy to actually market and sell a little bit of that as the right opportunities come up with long-term contracts. On the 50% to 90% available, that\u2019s already you could tell at a ramp as you go through the years. We wanted to keep that 50% level, one as an insurance policy for our utility in case it was needed and two because we really do think economically those prices will be a little bit better and that\u2019s what we used to call the layering in capacity contracts. So we\u2019re not trying to be greedy and we are trying to be patient. So we are layering them in if they are little bit better each time we get a chance, and so if some more come up, if there was another good deal, we might layer in some more we don\u2019t have one right now. Andrew Weisel : Great, very helpful. My next question is on the weather-adjusted load growth. Residential's been a little bit volatile recently. I believe it was down about 2% in the first quarter, then up about 4% this quarter. Any comments on the trends there, you're not really a story based on load growth; just curious what's driving those movements and what you're expecting for this year and beyond? Tom Webb : In part, it\u2019s our highly skilled ability to the weather adjustments, maybe we\u2019re not the best in the business. So you\u2019re right and to be a little more precise in the first quarter, our residential sales were down 2.1%. We scratched our heads and we said can\u2019t be right, it\u2019s got to be weather adjustments when we get more than 1 or 2 standard deviations away from normal. So here we are in the second quarter, now we\u2019re up 3.8% for residential. Now, often people would cheer and say isn\u2019t that great and build stories around it. I actually scratch our heads and say isn\u2019t that a little bit of the weather adjustments again. So what I like to do and I hope you bear with us is sort of average those two together and what we will tell you is that we think is that if we\u2019re in a small growth this year, that would be nice.  But what we\u2019re planning on is a small decline for residential. We may be for the full year, we maybe a little conservative on that and on commercial we say it\u2019s going to be flat and I think we\u2019re realistic on that and then on industrial, we\u2019ll tell you we\u2019ll be up 2.5 plus percent and I think that\u2019s pretty realistic to because we did see, you didn\u2019t ask about it but a tick down on the industrial side and what we saw there was still good strength on food, manufacturing, automotive, chemicals, a whole variety of construction, a whole variety of areas we\u2019re ticking up nicely as we expected but metals did not do well. I think that has to do with the competitive pressure coming out of China and in addition we had a couple of our bigger businesses. So one on the construction side with insulation, that just did an acquisition and they are actually relaying out a lot of their production facilities and I wouldn\u2019t even mention it except that it was a 1% decline all by itself. So we may have some oddities on the industrial side in our report for this quarter, and we\u2019ll see how that plays out. Does that help you? Andrew Weisel : Yes, very helpful commentary. Thank you. Tom Webb : Operator, any other questions? Operator : There are no further questions in queue. Patti Poppe : Okay, well thank you everyone for listening into our call today. We appreciate your interest and ownership. Tom and I look forward to seeing many of you over the next few months. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the investor relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 1 PM Eastern time running through November 3. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the investor relations section. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Sri Maddipati : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.  This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures to most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Patti. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Sri. Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. For those of you who have not yet met Sri, he is our new Treasurer and Vice President of IR. Sri has been with CMS for a couple years and we're excited to have him in his new role.  I'll begin the presentation with an update to earnings and describe our simple but powerful model. Tom will then provide the detailed financial results and outlook and we'll finish with some Q&A.  We're happy to report adjusted earnings for the first three quarters are up $0.22 and we have narrowed our guidance to the high end of our forecasted range of $2 to $2.02 or 6% to 7% over last year's performance. As a reminder, we previously announced our long term adjusted EPS guidance of 6% to 8% and we're introducing today specific 2017 earnings guidance of $2.13 to $2.17 a share. It was a strong quarter and that sets us up for a strong finish to 2016. That strong finish will be led by our continued implementation of the Consumers Energy way. We're proud of our consistent financial performance. My coworkers are motivated to serve our families, friends and neighbors. There are many times, however, when those same coworkers, in spite of their best efforts, are unable to serve our customers to our desired standard. Many of our processes are burdened with waste that goes unchecked and the CE way is simply a lean operations model focused squarely on business results through customer-focused standards, implemented by enabled employees working within well-designed and standard processes in a mindset that every day there's an opportunity for continuous improvement. Completing our work safely with high quality, low cost and on time will deliver the same consistent results for customers and investors that we have had for over a decade. As a result of our efforts, I am more confident than ever in our ability to deliver our simple but powerful model. We have depth in our organic capital plan. I have yet to attend a meeting where we have trouble identifying opportunities to invest. We have a long shopping list with lots of investments that improve safety, reliability, affordability and our customer's experience. Nothing new here. We will tackle the structural costs with these smart investments, good business decision-making and continuous process improvement. We plan conservatively for sales growth and we don't dilute our earnings black equity. All of this adds up to a sustainable model that enables investment while keeping our rates affordable. Like I said, our shopping list is long and we're not making any big bets to fill out the plan. We have a large electric distribution system. It's made up of over 70,000 miles of conductor, 1200 substations that all need to be upgrade and maintained. And we have a lot of work to do just to modernize our grid, starting with completing our electric smart meter installations in 2017. We continue to increase our gas investments. I'd like to remind people that we have a great gas business, where smart investments have real return for our customers. We still have to say no to projects because we can't spend more than our customers can afford. Our generation fleet continues to evolve in small bites, incremental renewables, capacity upgrades, coal to gas conversions. These are all small bets that add real value and cost savings, cleaner energy and reliability for our customers. And future PPA replacements could even potentially allow for additional investment without affecting customers' bills. The ability to pay is always our limiting factor which is why we're so focused on sustainable and structural cost reductions. It is not easy to be the leader of the pack on cost reduction year over year over year, however that is our ambition. Let me remind you that many of our previous decisions were structural, permanent and have many years of favorable impact. For example our conversion to defined contribution plans that significantly reduced our long term liabilities. Each year as my coworkers retire and replaced by a new workforce, we save about 1.6% of the previous year's O&M before we tackle a single work process improvement with the CE way. We have a lot more gas pedal in waste elimination that results in real cost savings. Those cost savings then allow us to be focused on making our prices competitive so that we can continue to be part of the Michigan growth story. We're seeing positive momentum, cooperation and success stories related to our customers' growth and economic development in our service territory. We're bullish on Michigan. The more we improve our business model, the more companies and their employees will choose Michigan as a place to locate or grow their businesses. And the stats don't lie. Michigan is growing faster than the U.S. average. And Grand Rapids, the heart of our electric territory, is going faster than the Michigan average. We feel great about being part of that success today and into the future. And still, we plan conservatively for load growth. As we continue to maximize customer value with a strong investment portfolio, to drive waste out of our operations and to let customer affordability be our throttle, we will continue to deliver high-end and quality earnings growth. Our constructive relationships with our state policymakers, legislators and regulators is based on keeping our promise to perform and to care for our customers and communities. And performance is power. When we perform at best-in-class levels, we can earn the trust and admiration and deliver hometown service for our customers. Day in and day out, you and our customers can count on us. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Webb : Thanks, Patti. Third quarter results, at $0.67, were up $0.14 compared with a year ago. Adjusted to exclude the cost of our voluntary separation program, results were $0.70 or up $0.17. In either case, this is substantially better than our original plan even as it reflects meaningful O&M reinvestment, permitted by cost reductions ahead of plan and the warm muggy summer. Now for the first nine months overall, our GAAP earnings were $1.70 per share, up $0.19 from last year. Adjusted for the VSP cost, results were $1.73, up $0.22 or 23% on a weather-normalized basis. As you can see here again, our performance in the first nine months is $0.22 better than last year. Adverse weather hurt $0.10. We blew away our 5% to 7% EPS growth target, growing more than 10%, including the mild winter weather. Improvements included benefit savings, lower uncollectible accounts, cold plant closures, hole-top hardening, higher demand and productivity at dig, to name just a few of the areas. Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, if weather is just normal, we will accomplish a nice uptick of $0.13 compared with 2015. And as you know, we already have a head start on the fourth quarter, with cost reductions well ahead of plan. We also have an electric rate case underway and that was self-implemented at $170 million on September 1. We filed a gas rate case last August which will support 2017. We have plenty of room for reinvesting O&M for our customers this year and we raised our 2016 guidance to the high end of our 5% to 7% range. This has become an investor-favorite slide, where we show our projected earnings per share growth for the full year. And this is as the year progresses. During the first quarter mild winter weather and abnormal storms reduced earnings per share by $0.13, but in a very short period of time we were right back on track for our adjusted earnings growth at 5% to 7%. You can see the improvements that offset the abnormal weather with no impact on customers. We're well ahead of our guidance and as always, are putting the upside to work for customers improving reliability, pulling ahead work from next year, as well as pre-funding debt maturities. And we will deliver consistent peer-leading earnings per share growth. We beat guidance and delivered 7% adjusted earnings growth for almost 15 years. Here is a picture of that track record. It shows how we consistently offset bad news and put good news to use for our customers without compromising predictable earnings growth of 7% each and every year. Over the last three years favorable weather and cost reductions in excess of our plan generated room to reinvest $0.25 billion for our customers. $0.25 billion. Half of that came from favorable weather and half from cost productivity better than planned. That is a big number. We put these savings to work in many beneficial ways. So by this year we're 20% ahead of our plan. Our customers and investors really will benefit. In addition to our cost performance, our conservative view of sales growth and our ability to avoid diluted equities, we still have other attractive upsides. As you can see in this slide, continued layering in of energy and capacity sales could enable us to increase our profitability by $20 million to $40 million at our Dearborn industrial generation operations. Recent capacity sales have exceeded $4 a kilowatt month. This is a nice insurance policy for our utility, if it needs more capacity and a catalyst for new growth. And to help you with your own assessment of our future performance, here is our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity slide. Recall the impacts from many legislative changes are not in our plan. Interest rate shifts up or down largely offset at our Company as changes in debt cost offset changes in discount rates on our pension plans. We believe in no big bets and strong risk mitigation. And here is our report card. For 2016, we're right on course to achieve our plans for capital investment, a high-quality balance sheet, competitive customer prices, a robust dividend payout and strong operating cash flow. We're well ahead of our adjusted earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% range, therefore we raised guidance to the high end. We have introduced specific guidance for 2017 at $2.13 to $2.17, up 6% to 8% for this year. Count on another strong year, our 15th in a row, with high-end predictable earnings, cash flow and dividend growth. This is my 57th CMS quarterly call in a row, maybe my voice is wearing out and has been sharing with you the results of a great team delivering consistent industry-leading earnings per share growth for over 14 years. We intend to continue this next year and for a long time.  Our earnings and dividend growth continue at a predictable high pace every year, no matter what is happening in the economy, the weather, politics or succession planning. And I think all of you who have met Patti can certainly attest to that. Thank you for your interest and your support. Patti and I would be delighted to take your questions. So Tracy, would you be kind enough to open the telephone lines? Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with UBS. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin : It's Julien. Just a couple of questions, can you go over a little bit of what the pull forward poor opportunities for the $0.15 you kind of delayed here. Just give us a little bit of the flavor of each one of those in terms of what they mean in terms of the timing perspective recognition in '17 onward and then I have a follow-up in some policies. Tom Webb : Absolutely. What Julian is talking to if you have all the slides handy it was slide number 12. The slide I called an investor favorite, I know it's my. I just got that curve in it with the little blue box in it, that blue box in terms of what are some of the pull ahead. What are some choices that we have, with all this favorable performance from better cost reductions and we have actually planned and we have a nice toasty summer here at the end with a nice humidity that we don't always get in lovely Michigan which helped us a bit. But in that box you will see a few different items. First one is pull aheads, those are traditional things that we do, if we can take work from next year and pull it into this year it makes the job we have to do next year easier and so some examples are there are some small outages that we are able to pull ahead, a little bit of tree trimming got pulled ahead during the course of the year, things that improve reliability, things that help us be a better company for our customers and make our job a little easier as we go into 2017. The next item that\u2019s listed there is called debt pre-funding. I think everybody knows we're such chickens that we go out and pre-fund our parent debt at least two years in advance to ensure that if there was a nightmarish scenario of 2007 or 2008 proportions we would not have any exposure in the capital markets. This is some of that, this is simply pulling ahead some debt that will mature calling that potentially when it's economic and doing a little more financing for that. It's a little bit of bad news for this year, so it's one of those choices that helps you in the next year or two, that\u2019s a nice one. There is a list at the bottom there that talks about operations and quality. There are so many things that we can do to be better for our customers that aren't necessarily in our rate cases and not necessarily in our basic plans, but we will do those. I will just give you one example, Patti has talked and I have talked about the consumers energy way. Well sometimes it takes a little bit of money to bring in the talent to help you make these changes in your processes to the better ways of doing things.  So this gives us a little more resource to do some of that work even sooner than we plan to do so that we can get ahead of the game that improves on our quality, it improves on our delivery, improves on our cost and makes us a healthier better company for you but importantly for our customers and then the reason I picked the third one last it's sort of what happens towards the end of the year. We get a choice of how much money can we put into our company foundation and to low income funds to help customers, to help the people of Michigan, to help our hometown team quite candidly and in some years even though we have been strained where we have a very big storm at the end of the year and maybe we don't have as many resources to put towards that, but in other years we have an opportunity to catch up a little bit and put some more money into the foundation and those are the choices we get to make towards the end of the year. So that gives you a little bit of sense on what the things are -- the categories and how they can help you next year ensure that your growth in 6% to 8% zone which is an important commitment for us becomes easier to do or more difficult to do as far as that goes but in this case it makes it a little bit easier. Julian, I hope that helps. We will go to your next question. Julien Dumoulin : Absolutely just real quickly, can you elaborate a little bit on what your thoughts and expectations coming out of this [indiscernible] Michigan deal are? Certainly we heard from your peers yesterday but we want to get your view and specifically can you comment on what kind of rate, what's the ballpark and to the extent that the rate may be higher than what you are seeing out there in MISO capacity. Would that also bode well for your pricing on your big assets at least the ones folks might want to contract with local merchant assets instead of paying the capacity charge under that construct? Patti Poppe : There are a lot of things in-flight with the MISO filing and what the implications are. So I'll try and break it down a little bit and then answer completely your question. So first of all MISO is filing for somewhere around November 1. This opportunity for a three year forward-looking auction and we think that\u2019s important addition to Michigan for all of MISO but it's definitely important to Michigan given our hybrid regulatory construct. Therefore their filing has a provision for what's called prevailing state compensation mechanism which the State works with MISO to establish in order for the state to have an alternative in the event that forward showing auction and our forward-looking statements looking capacity shows shortfall so in the event of a shortfall typically the option would go simply to cone [ph] and that would set the price. So to your question on prices yes the capacity prices would go up just with the auction, but if Michigan sees a look at short fall then they implement prevailing state compensation mechanism which requires them the alternative energy suppliers to show that they have owned or contractor capacity for the subsequent three planning years and then their customers pay a capacity charge that the NPS fee will have the authority to set So obviously that charge has an impact on the alternative energy supplier customers but what we think is fair about that is that if additional capacity is required, then the people who are requiring are actually paying for it versus our bundled customers, so it protects our full bundle customers because we know that we will have adequate supply to serve our customers. Now from a DIG perspective I will let Tom address what the implications for DIG might be if that MISO auction. Tom Webb : Naturally, the more people have to turn to find those resources. Now they can't get -- I will call it a free ride that I mean that in a very constructive and complementary way, but they can't get a free ride. They got to go secure their capacity, well there is only so many places to go to get capacity in zone seven and nearby zones. So obviously that could help in and that fits in with why we set this layering in strategy. We try not to be too greedy thinking that we stay out of the capacity markets all of sudden we can get everything at some peak price. We're trying to layer it and just recently we layered in, I mentioned it in the tax, a little more good news we did a little more capacity sales above $4 a kilowatt month, so that\u2019s an opportunity that could help but don't forget DIG can also be just an excellent backup to our own utility if there is a need for that capacity and that\u2019s another reason why we haven't committed all of it so far. Patti Poppe : And then Julien I guess I would just add one more implication then for the utility in the event of this implementation. If the alternative energy supplier can't secure additional capacity, then it defaults to and then the NPS can direct the utility to build out that capacity and that then those charges will be assigned to those alternative energy suppliers so that is definitely a potential. Now the timing of all this, the filing for MISO is November of this year. We think there won't be a final ruling from FERC until 2017 and that implies then that it won't be available at -- the earliest it would be available would be in the 2018 auction which is actually for the 20/21/22 planning years. So there's a lot of time and a lot of things that can change between here and there but we know why MISO is motivated because they are concerned about reliability, long term and transparency of the supply and we agree with their concerns. I will reiterate though that our plan and our CapEx forward plans do not require that this MISO provision be in place. We do not require that the energy lobby be past, we really are in a position that our plans is solid with or without either the energy law or the MISO tariff approval. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Your line is now open. Greg Gordon : So just to be clear, your base plan and the growth rate don\u2019t necessarily rely on or expect significant improvement in financial performance as DIG. So when I look at slide 14, and you\u2019ve said this before so I just want to make sure it's still the case, did that expand potential theoretical expansion in revenues is not necessarily for you to achieve your growth targets, correct? Tom Webb : It definitely is not. What you see in yellow on that slide is all the ability to create more headroom. We do not need any of that to meet our growth targets starting next year at 6% to 8%. Greg Gordon : Great. Can I go a little bit further afield and ask a question with regard to the Palisades nuclear contract? It strikes me that when that contract was initially signed, power prices were at a totally different planet than they are today. And it looks like that MISO power prices are significantly lower than what you're going to be paying over time for the power coming from that asset. When you think about both the energy and the capacity that you are getting from Palisades, is there a theoretical construct where it would be in the best interest of the customers to restructure or buy out that contract? Tom Webb : You are always very good at your analysis, but this is a subject that we actually can't talk about today and I hope you will appreciate that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ali Agha : Looking at the weather-normalized electrics sales through the nine months, it appears that they are up 0.5%. Does the 1% target for the year still look good? Or what should we be assuming now for the year? Real good, it really does look good. I know you can see the pieces there. When you look at the pieces, I call residential up 0.5 point, commercial down 0.5 point for the year to date September. I call that flat. I just wash those out. Even though net, those numbers were positive to earnings.  You'll see the industrial side is up about 2%. We see some good information that is flowing through production plans that people have for the rest of the year. And we are quite comfortable with assuming that residential and commercial will still be flattish. We're not going to try to predict 0.1 or 0.2 or 0.3 up or down, either way. And we still think the industrial side is going to be up about 2.5%, giving us a good 1% growth.  Let me give you little color. We have seen some pipelines and other utilities, not us but other utilities, doing pretty well. And we have watched the manufacturing side in chemicals and plastics doing very well. Duh, nice oil prices and gas prices, so they are able to do good business here from Michigan. And even the automotive side continues to be robust.  Now, on the negative side we have seen some of the steel fabrication businesses and companies struggling a little bit. So some of that mineral side and steel fabrication, not doing as well. But net-net, some nice upticks in the sector. And when we get a chance to look at where people are scheduling their production for the rest of the year and the things they are going to do, we feel pretty comfortable about where we are. And Tom, remind me, is that the run rate you use when going forward, roughly 1% annual growth? Tom Webb : We probably wouldn't say that. We are so doggone conservative that we like to tell you just think somewhere between flat to 1% growth, that's about how we plan the future, because that's how we look at our business. We try to get a sense that, plan it low. You've heard my story many times about my experiences back at Ford and why that pays out because if you are wrong and it is a little higher than you think, that is a helpful thing as you go through a given year. If you are wrong and it is lower, then that is a struggle and you got to do things that you might not have planned to do to make your commitment to your customers and your commitment to your investors. So we would rather be on that conservative side. So off the top of my head, I would like to think when we run numbers we run them from flat to 1% and anywhere in that zone we feel pretty good. Ali Agha : Separately, when you benchmark your costs versus your peer group, right now where do you think you are? Are you in the top quartile, the second quartile? Where are we in terms of benchmarking what all you have done so far? Patti Poppe : Yes, I would say, Ali, total costs were in the top quartile. Those structural changes that we've made, the long-term cost savings that we've put in place, puts us in total. However, where we see the big opportunity is in our distribution operations, both gas and electric are still middle of the pack. And so our pursuit of both the great customer experience and low cost structure, really, we feel like that's where a lot of our headroom lives. That's why we're working so hard on our process improvements. Ali Agha : I see. Last question. I know in both the rate cases you get asked for the investment recovery mechanism. Previously the staff and the Commission has not been very supportive of that. Any sign that this time around they're thinking differently? Or anything you can point to? Patti Poppe : We have had good luck with our gas-enhanced infrastructure replacement program, which is essentially an investment recovery mechanism on our gas business. And so I think that has earned some trust and respect with the commission. I think they are more open to it. Their bigger concern is infrastructure reliability in the state. Post Flint, our Commission is very adamant that not on our watch will we have another infrastructure crisis related to the utilities. So it makes the conditions more amenable to these investment recovery mechanisms.  Though they do want to -- and they have gone on the record saying they like having annual rate cases where they can see and we can pass on cost savings. So I think it is an opportunity to continue to grow those investment recovery mechanisms, but not necessarily get a flat rider on capital where we don't have to go in for rate cases. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Your line is now open. Travis Miller : I was wondering, when you talk about the play between the cost savings that you guys are realizing in a big way and being able to keep customer bills either low or from rising faster. I wonder if you could give a sense for how much of that cost savings you are seeing right now, that $0.32 from the nine months or even the future cost savings would go back to that customer, i.e., through lower bills or through slower rising bills? Tom Webb : 100%, here is the point behind that. In the short period of time where we might have a cost reduction this year that clearly will have an impact on our business and our results, right? We look for those annual rate cases that Patti just talked about, and it is one of the key features of the annual rate case. Primarily it is to collect on the capital investment that we are making for our customers, but it's also our mechanism to give back that money to our customers with our O&M cost reductions. The lag is just from the period that there is to the next rate case. So we will share that with them and we set as a goal on our base rates to try to keep that growth at or below the rate of inflation. So pick your number, everyone has a different real inflation number, but let's just say it is 2%. If we can stay under that 2% then that means those base rates are going up -- they're going down negatively on a real basis. So that is our goal and we are constantly doing that work to share with them. Now, I grant you, it gives us more headroom so that we can do more of that capital investment which does then grow the business for earnings. Does that get at your question? Travis Miller : Yes, absolutely. Tom Webb : Thank you. Travis Miller : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Paul Ridzon : Can you give your view of what is happening in the legislature and what we can expect before year end? Patti Poppe : You bet. As I am sure you have seen a little bit of the press that's been out in the last week or so, the Michigan Chamber has now endorsed the bill package. And that is allowing for some more momentum and there has been a compromise on the renewable portfolio standard at 15% for 2021 that's bringing some more Democrats on board. Therefore, there seems to be quite a bit of momentum. However, we have seen momentum before, so we really are cautiously optimistic.  Arlan Meekhof, the Majority Senate Leader, and Mike Nofs, the Energy Chair out of the Senate, are working hard toward a vote post election. With the proper momentum and a good vote count, they will take that vote and potentially move it then into the House. So there's a lot of things that would have to come to fruition to get it to pass in the House. But with the right momentum and bipartisan support and the support of the Michigan Chamber, it is more likely, I would say, than ever, but I still put odds around 50-50 that it gets done before year end.  And as you know, Paul, we continue to reiterate our plan doesn't require the law but we think it is good policy for Michigan. We think it is important that energy resource supply be transparent and that the cost allocations be fair for new and additional capacities. This suite of Bills does that work and does a good job of it, so we are supportive of it. But again, our plan doesn't count on it and it doesn't require it. Paul Ridzon : And none of the compromises that have been made -- or I should say all the compromises have vetted with the governor and he's still okay with it? Patti Poppe : Yes. The administration has been very supportive. They have concern about resource adequacy in Michigan, particularly for the power provided by the alternative energy suppliers. They have real frustration that it is not transparent where that power is coming from. And the administration and the Commission and the utilities have been very clear that we want to make sure that it is transparent, that we have adequate supply for the whole state. We know we have adequate supply for our customers. We want to make sure that the alternative energy suppliers also have adequate supply one way or another for their customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenberg Thalmann. Your line is now open. Brian Russo : Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I am just curious that the Senate Bill 437 that was just referenced, will that change your capital budget, either by size or mix of investments? Patti Poppe : We don't think so. Our CapEx plan and as you saw in our slides, our generation strategy is smaller and smaller bets. We want to make sure that we build for necessary load, that we are focused on a diverse portfolio that can adjust as load shifts and so that we can make quicker, smaller bets rather than long, long-term big bets. So there is nothing in the provisions of the law that would change that strategy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Your line is now open. Andy Levi : What was the reason you can't discuss Palisades? Tom Webb : Usually when you make a no comment answer, that's it. Actually it is because my voice is cracking up. I have got nothing left. Truthfully, this just is one of those subjects that we are not able to talk about and you can imagine why. Andy Levi : And then on a bigger picture, if the Palisades contract was ceased, we will just leave it like that, how many megawatts, remind us how many megawatts that would be. Tom Webb : I think about 800 megawatts. Andy Levi : 800 megawatts. Obviously number one, it could either be restructured, that could be a way you could also get out of it. One of the opportunities would be to you to replace that power with your own generation? Or with a DIG or what would be the strategy and opportunity for CMS? Tom Webb : It's something that we really can't get into. So we appreciate the question and your patience. Patti Poppe : But I will say this. Generally, about our capacity planning strategy, we have alternative options. When PPAs do come off and we have a couple -- we have many PPAs, and as they retire and we decide whether we're going to renegotiate those PPAs or replace them, we do have options to bring in -- to do more bilaterals with other energy suppliers, or to build new capacity, incremental renewables, more demand response and energy efficiency. We are doing a lot of, obviously, capacity planning to make sure that we have adequate supply for all of our customers for all the years to come. It is an exciting time because we have a lot of smaller bet options that can provide for a very diverse portfolio for serving our customers. And that frees up, then, investment room in our electric distribution system and our gas business where we have significant investment requirements. So we really have a good balanced approach right now. Andy Levi : Really the bottom line is whether it is this contract or any contract PPAs that are dropping off, one of the opportunities is to replace it with basically a self-build or some type of capacity that you would be the owner of. Patti Poppe : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is now open. Paul Patterson : I just wanted to follow up on the MISO capacity team, or scheme. What I am wondering is that, if an alternative energy provider doesn't buy capacity on his own, he would be assessed the capacity charge, is my understanding, for buying it from you guys or other utilities. Is that correct? Patti Poppe : It actually would work as a charge to the customer of the alternative energy supplier, not the energy supplier themselves. Paul Patterson : Okay. That actually answers my question. Thank you. And then the second question that I have is, there is this transmission discussion with MISO and the governor about bringing in Canadian power to Michigan as a means of lowering prices. I was wondering if you had any color on that, if you guys might participate in something like -- it's a project or something like that. Or any thoughts you guys had on that. Patti Poppe : So the MISO study that the state requested really has several components. One is the feasibility of connecting the Upper Peninsula, which is not our service territory. Zone 2 in the MISO zone to Sault Ste. Marie and between Sault Ste. Marie and Ontario. Then looking at connecting the UP and the Lower Peninsula to an existing transmission project in Gaylord. Or starting a large gas plant constructed up north somewhere up in the UP.  So it's a variety of studies and they are all pointing to one situation as trying to be correct, and that is the resource adequacy issue. Because of our regulatory construct in Michigan, there is this loophole in the UP that has caused a major cost shift up there. So they are trying to figure out a way to better serve the people of the Upper Peninsula.  We participate to the extent that we are energy experts and the governor relies on us for our input and insights, but the study that they requested from MISO really will help frame up the situation, I would say. And when it is complete, we will certainly obviously take a look and see what the options are. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Paul Ridzon : I recently saw someone's planning a large gas plant in Michigan right on the Indiana border. Do you have any thoughts on that? I don't know if you have seen it or not. I don't remember the name of the plant, unfortunately. Tom Webb : I don't know who you are talking about that's doing that. But people are constantly looking at should we built here, build there? When you are down in that general area, you might be talking about Illinois solutions. And you are probably aware that, for instance, Covert, one of the larger IPPs that is left, is hooked up to PJM, but they are in the process, potentially, of selling their plant.  So these things are dynamic but I don't have a lot of specifics on that particular question. But I will tell you what I will do, I will double-check after I am off the call and if there is something of substance we know about, we will share that. Operator : There are no further questions. I turn the call back over to the presenters. Patti Poppe : Great, thank you. And thanks for listening to our call today, everybody. We appreciate your interest and definitely appreciate your ownership. Tom and I look forward to seeing many of you at EEI in just a couple weeks. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I will turn the call over to Patti. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you, Sri. Welcome, and good morning. Welcome to 2016 year-end earnings call. We had another great year, and we look forward to sharing the highlights with you today. I'll review our 2016 results and 2017 focus and priorities, and Tom will cover the financial results and outlook. As you know, we released this morning that we, again, hit our top end of guidance at 7% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth at $2.02. That makes 14 years in a row of consistent performance at the top end. Based on our 2016 actual performance, we're raising our 2017 full-year guidance to the range of $2.14 to $2.18 or 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth. As our earnings are growing among the best, we matched that with equally strong dividend growth. Therefore, we once again increased our dividend 7% in line with our EPS growth. As you've to come expect, our financial performance is not an accident. Our financial performance is supported by our operational strength. We're proud to share that we had our safest year on record, which is a 20% improvement over last year's previous best. We also had the best generation reliability on record. We delivered this performance, while at the same time, we retired 7 of our 12 coalfield generation units. Delivering operational success like this while at the same time transitioning our fleet so significantly requires a disciplined team focused on results. We once again delivered best-in-class cost reductions as well. In fact, O&M is down 6.5% year-over-year. This fuels our 10-year investment plan of $2.5 billion from our projection last year. Lots of people ask, so I'll definitely provide more details about how we continue to do this. We are well underway for another great year with emphasis on the new energy law, our Clean and Lean capacity replacement strategy and the Consumers Energy Way. Let's start by reviewing the energy law highlights. The Michigan legislature and governor, in concert with the Michigan Agency for Energy and the MPSC, have delivered solid policy for our state. At the highest level, this new law addresses the retail open access cross subsidy, enabling more competitive prices and eliminates the risk of energy shortfalls in Michigan. We're reminding everyone that Michigan is open for business. This new law creates a framework for our Clean and Lean generation strategy, led by improved energy efficiency and demand response incentive, a 15% RPS standard and a very constructive net metering framework that removes the subsidy for the future producers of private solar. Also, there's an integrated resource planning process that will allow for longer-term planning as well as upfront prudency review of our supply and demand strategy, which will result in a modern, reliable and affordable energy supply for Michigan. Let me take a minute to share a bit more about what we mean when we refer to Clean and Lean. Our recent Palisades PPA termination application is a great example. We have long said that an inflexible above-market PPA is not a cost effective option for our customers and provides no long-term value for our investors. At the same time, we want to assure that we have sufficient resources to serve the load in Michigan. The traditional approach would be to replace the PPA with a megawatt-for-megawatt central station power plant. Instead, we believe we can use this change as an opportunity to build out a cleaner and leaner resource mix that assures reliability at the lowest cost possible that is a win for both customers and investors. By cleaner, we mean replacing Palisades with more energy efficiency, demand response, additional coal-to-gas switching and renewable energy as called for in our new law. By leaner, we mean, when replacing Palisades, we can reduce demand on the peaks and fully utilize our existing gas assets. This saves our customers both energy and money. We're right-sizing our asset to match demand, thereby eliminating waste and still assuring reliability. We can de-risk our entire capital plan by freeing up dollars that would be traditionally captive in a single big bet capital project, for many smaller options that meet more of our customers' needs with less risk and less waste. And as we often remind you, we have plenty of that work that needs to be done. We are confident that we have a solid capacity replacement plan for Palisades that will ensure reliability and increasingly clean and affordable supply for the people of Michigan for years to come. I hope you're picking up on our continued theme of Lean thinking. It's Lean thinking that underpins not only our generation strategy, but it is the heart of our CE Way. Lean is not just low cost. It's about waste elimination that improves value for our customers at the lowest cost. Our business model is based on this Lean way of thinking. We're deploying our CE Way in all areas of our business. We are far from perfect and we can find areas for continuous improvement and waste elimination in every aspect of our work. We can then deploy the value created in waste elimination to drive sustainable growth. By teaching our entire team to see and eliminate waste, we will provide a safe and reliable system for our customers at the lowest cost possible and grow our business. It may seem simple but it's not easy. This Lean way of thinking is how we will deliver world-class business results and why we can promise many years of further improvement. The CE Way really is a sustainable way of running our business, where we don't make trade-off between key constituents but rather we intend to focus on our triple bottom line, people, planet and profit, underpinned by our unwavering commitment to world-class performance. In fact, we are selected by Sustainalytics as the number one utility in America for sustainable business practices in 2016. Our simple but powerful business model is the manifestation of our commitment to people, planet and profit. Our system needs improvement. And without the hard work that our team does to reduce absolute cost year over year over year, our investment requirements would be too expensive for our customers. We insist on both, serving our customers and doing it at the lowest cost possible. We're not chasing profits or cost cuts at the expense of safety reliability of our system. Rather we're delivering consistent profits and performance because we're focused on the heart of our business, our customers. Our 10-year capital investment plan reflects our Lean thinking and our growth strategy. As a reminder, we announced in December that we've increased our 10-year capital plan to $18 billion. Our new law increased our renewable portfolio standard by 15% by 2021. And so we've added more renewable generation to our plan, in line with our Clean and Lean approach. We've also added an additional $500 million in our large gas system to continue to reduce cost and improve safety and deliverability over the next 10 years. The Governor's Infrastructure Commission's report was published at the end of 2016 and he reinforced in his State of the State Address that investment in infrastructure in Michigan is a top priority. The report found that our existing regulatory model works well to provide the funding and oversight needed for critical infrastructure investments in electricity and gas. Michigan's regulatory model, which was improved by the 2016 energy law, is the ultimate public-private partnership in service of the people of Michigan. This is not a blank check in our mind. We're always self-constrained by our customers' ability to pay, which is why our ongoing cost reduction performance serves both investors and customers. As we reduce cost over time, we can grow our business, do more CapEx for areas like grid modernization, more gas infrastructure and PPA replacements in the future without unduly burdening our customers, high quality, safe and reliable service at the lowest cost possible. This is Lean thinking. One thing I've learned over the passing of time is that performance is power. When our performance is strong, when our processes are in control and our promises are kept, we can be flexible and adapt as the weather, the economy, policymakers and policies evolve. Our business model has and will continue to stand the test of time in a changing environment when it is backed by world-class performance delivered in a hometown way. That's the CE Way. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Patti. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you can see here, adjusted 2016 earnings at $2.02 a share grew by $0.13 or 7%. No surprise. Our GAAP earnings at $1.98 a share were up $0.09 or 5%. This included the voluntary separation program we announced last summer and tentative settlement of some old gas reporting cases. All of our businesses improved year-to-year. This is our standard look at our earnings per share outlook for 2016, throughout 2016. Early on, we offset abnormal storms and a warmer winter. Later, we put to work upside from another strong year of cost performance and a warm summer. If we had not reinvested, our earnings per share could have been up 15%. Our reinvestment and O&M, however, was big. It included improvements in reliability and service. We also prefunded parent debt and made meaningful contributions to low-income funds, as well as our foundation. In total, our O&M cost was down 6.5% for 2016 compared with 2015. Yeah, 6.5% lower after all the ups and downs. Our 2016 performance adds one more year in a long track record of adjusted earnings per share growth at 7%. And imagine, during the last four years, we reinvested one-third of $1 billion for our customers. Half of this was made possible by favorable weather, half by cost reduction, cost reductions much better than planned. We achieved all of our financial targets for 2016. These included strong capital investment, healthy balance sheet ratios, competitive customer price improvements, robust operating cash flow growth, earnings per share growth at the top end of guidance and as announced last week, another 7% increase in our dividend. The increase keeps pace with our high-end EPS growth, which, of course, is at the high end of peers. For 2017, we're pleased to have raised our guidance to reflect adjusted 6% to 8% growth on top of 2016 results, which were at the top end of our guidance. So, we continue to build success upon success, no resets here. As shown here, our rate cases primarily reflect capital investment. They also permit us to flow through productivity improvements to our customers. We expect to reduce O&M cost another 2% this year and perhaps that's a little conservative based on after being at the top end for the decade and annual cost reductions of around 3%. This keeps our base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. On a real basis, this reduces rate. This level of cost reduction is not easy to do as Patti mentioned. Few utilities can do it. This enables our rapidly growing customer investment. Looking ahead now, we should have an order on our electric rate case next month. We expect an ROE in the 10.1% to 10.3% range. This would mirror recent orders at DTE. We're in the middle of the process of our pending gas case while the self-implementation is lower than expected, we have no reservations about working with the Commission to complete a satisfactory result. Here's our cost reduction track record. You know we're proud of it. But what's important is, our commitment to continue for a long time. This comes from good business decisions that permit productivity gains as the workforce turns over, the shift from coal to gas generation, the introduction of smart meters and the elimination of waste. As we improve customer quality through better work processes, we'll see an overtime cost saved, as well as temporary workers saved by doing it right the first time. We already are seeing evidence of our Consumers Energy Way process improvements. These drive up quality and they drive down costs. We work to improve customer service and we eliminate waste. Now for 2014, 2015 and 2016, we reduced our costs by more than 3% a year, and we planned conservatively to reduce cost a further 2% in each of the next three years. This helps fund that growing investment for customers. For the last dozen years, our gross operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million a year. Since 2004, it's increased from $353 million to $2.1 billion last year. Over the next five years, it'll grow about $800 million to $2.9 billion. Our NOLs, bonus depreciation and AMT credits help us provide and avoid the need for a block equity. If tax reform occurs, we expect that we'll still have a chance to use our NOLs although at a lower rate. We also would expect to access our AMT credits early, now let's talk about that more in just a few minutes. So, this is our sensitivity slide and we give this to you each quarter to help you assess our prospects. You can see that with reasonable planning assumptions and with robustness risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. There are always ups and downs. Already this year, certain property taxes are expected to be lower improving EPS by about $0.03. And energy efficiency incentives increased under the new energy law helping may be by about $0.02, but please keep in mind if the electric rate case ROE comes in at 10.1% next month that would hurt by about $0.03. We may have an opportunity to invest even more with anticipated tax reform. We're all trying to shed useful light on this complicated subject. None of us really knows what tax reform will include or if it will occur. Here's one set of assumptions. Corporate tax rates could drop to 15%. We could lose deductibility of interest expenses and state income taxes, and 100% asset expensing might occur. Now, we hope you'll find it helpful by seeing how this impacts each of our businesses, our utility, enterprises and the parent. At the utility, we're fortunate to have substantial organic investment not yet included in our plan, investment for gas infrastructure, PPA replacements and more renewables. Utilities in this situation will appreciate asset expensing to help fund new investment growth. At consumers, it would take only $100 million of new investment a year to backfill the 100% asset expensing. We've essentially already done that by raising our capital investment guidance from $17 billion to $18 billion last December. So, happy face for the utility. Our non-utility business, enterprises, will be impacted like normal non-utilities. Tax reform would help, but for us, it's a small business. The profit improvement would be a little under $10 million a year. Here's the great news. Interest income may be used to offset interest expense. Our parent debt interest expense may be offset by our EnerBank interest income. And this assumes that none of the old debt is grandfathered. We still have to see how that turns out. So, again, as you can see on the right, with forecasted interest income at EnerBank at about $130 million, we can offset parent debt interest expense. Even if none of the legacy interest expenses grant well, it's a happy face for the parent too. Again, none of us really know how the tax reform will end up. So, on the left of here, we have shown some alternatives to help you see different impacts. This shows the amount of CapEx backfill needed to offset 100% asset expensing at various tax rates. At 15%, we'd add $100 million each year. That would rise to $300 million each year at 25%. Recall, we have investment opportunities of at least $3 billion. Our customers will enjoy rate reductions until we reach about a 25% tax rate. As we approach a 25% tax rate, with all the other assumptions being equal, we expect that our customers' investors would lose. And of course, minor changes in tax reform could make all of this very different. In each alternative, we still are able to use our NOLs, although remember the benefit will be smaller. We also hope to accelerate use of our AMT credits to improve cash. We have not factored the use of the AMT credits in our planning yet, so there may be a little more upside there. Excluding tax reform, here's our new report card for 2017 and beyond. We anticipate another great year this year. With no big debts and robust risk mitigation, our model serves at you and our customers well. Few companies are able to deliver top-end earnings growth while improving value and service for customers year after year after year. We're pleased to have another outstanding consistent performance in 2016, and we expect to do the same in 2017. With another consistent strong year ahead, 15 years in a row, we're able to continue to deliver robust adjusted earnings per share growth. With our capital investment already raised from $17 billion to $18 billion over the next 10 years, we expect to grow earnings 6% to 8% each year. Our approach to funding capital investment both for customers and for investors makes our earnings per share and cash flow growth sustainable for the decade ahead. So, thank you again for joining our call today. This is my 58th in a row, still homing along. Operator, we'd be pleased if you open up to take questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much, Mr. Webb. Our first question comes from the line of Travis Miller of Morningstar. Your line is open. Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Good morning. Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hi. Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi. Just wondering with the new law, the RPS and then your investment plan, by the time you guys get to the end of your renewables investment, how would you stand relative to the RPS? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, so, because of the energy law and because of our $18 billion CapEx plan, we did add additional renewable investments that will take us to 15%. That's approximately about an extra $1 billion of investment in our total $18 billion for the 500 megawatts required to get to 15%. But we actually believe even beyond the RPS that our customers, particularly many of our large international customers and national brands want more renewables from us. So, we're working with them. And we don't expect that 15% will be the ultimate ceiling, but that is what the RPS standard will be. Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. And then you anticipated my question a bit, but follow-up there was, how much demand are you getting and how much could you adjust from C&I mandate or required or wanted types of renewable investment? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. I would just say that's a moving target. We'll plan for the 15% RPS and that will fulfill some of our customers' needs. And we think that demand will continue to evolve. And because of our Clean and Lean strategy, we'll take small bets and continue to add. We found ourselves to be very cost competitive in the renewable building and development process. And so, we'll expect to continue to be building our own renewables to serve our commercial and industrial customers. Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Great. I appreciate that. Thank you. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jerimiah Booream of UBS. Your line is open. Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on - Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Jeremiah. Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the renewables that \u2013 just wondering on the cadence of your investment. It looks pretty back half weighted into the 2022 to 2026 timeframe. And given the PTC step down and what we've seen from other companies taking advantage of safe harboring, what's the rationale for the cadence there? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, I would say that we actually have some active renewable development happening right now that we're able to take advantage of the PTC. We're expanding our crosswinds as we speak. And so, I expect that to be a pretty steady flow actually across our planning horizon. Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And is there any opportunity to sort of engage in the sort of steel for fuel argument we've heard from Xcel in terms of being able to offset customer rates purely from whether it's wind or anything else? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. We definitely see that as a potential, both in the short and the long run. Our version is Clean and Lean because we also include low-cost gas in our mix, but we think that there's an opportunity. Particularly when some of our large \u2013 particularly our one very large PPA comes off in the latter part of our 10-year planning cycle that that allows for that transition to renewables, lower fuel cost and therefore lower total costs with higher earnings potential. We think that that model works here as well. Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. So, good job. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Hi, Mike. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hi, Mike. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah. Very impressive work on cost cutting and I'm wondering if you could just discuss may be a little more detail around how cost cutting might progress as we move into the 2020s and beyond. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, we definitely see a combination of factors, but specifically our implementation of the CE Way. I carry around a story of the month. And my story this month is on our meter read rate and our meter reading improvements where we've increased from an average of about 89% meter read rate up to 98% meter read rate. So, improving the quality of our work and at the same time reducing the cost of overtime, reducing the cost of repeat visits on homes that we couldn't get in, improving our route optimization. So, we deploy these Lean process improvements, route cause analysis, visual management and optimization exercises to fundamentally reduce the cost to deliver a higher value outcome for customers. And so that sort of work we are just getting started across all of our operations in implanting those kinds of skills in our leadership team as well as our frontline employees. As I travel to State and work with our crews and see the work that we're doing around all of our customers, it's just incredible to me the potential that exist in getting our work done right the first time and doing it at the lowest cost possible. Oh, and I'm wrapped up in that. So, you can figure that to be \u2013 that's what we'll deliver, our consistent 2% to 3% operating expense reductions. That's what gives us confidence to continue to build our business model around that way of thinking. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah. How far out do you see being able to deliver 2% to 3% a year on average? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: I see in our 5 to 10-year time horizon that is very, very doable. I see no concerns in that. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Okay. Thank you so much. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: You spend a couple of days with me in a truck in our cruise. You'll see there's lots to be done. There's lots of potential just there. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I'll come out there tomorrow. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks so much. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. Bye now. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Okay. Good. We'll have you. Come on out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. Your line is open. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning, Patti. First question, can you remind us the $18 billion CapEx over the next 10 years? What does that equate to in terms of a rate base CAGR for you guys? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: It's the same 6% to 8%. So, it depends on how you time it out, but it's the driving force that drives up rate base that then drives up our investment that's required, which drives up our earnings and drives up our cash flow. So, we vary a little bit because then we're going to work our cost reductions to fund a lot of that. So, we don't have to pass that through in prices and keep our price increases down around 2%. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. But, Tom, just to be clear, because it's a single point number, right? So, does it fall right in the middle, 7%? Is that the way to think about it? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: It's not exactly. I know you want the single point number, and I know the math would tell you, you could do it that way. But remember, in December, we raised our CapEx guidance from $17 billion to $18 billion. We did not raise our 6% to 8%, right? Because, we'll be doing other things, some of that will drive cost reduction, some of it would just be for regulatory purposes or whatever. So, it's right in the zone and you configure out that it's probably a touch over 7%. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Second question. Weather normalized electric sales were negative in the fourth quarter. I think overall for the year came in slightly below what you had budgeted. Any plan to look at there, and remind us again what the 2017 budget is for weather normalized electric sales? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, I'm happy to do. We're still looking at a plan that's about 1% next year, and that's driven by industrial again. So, as you look at 2017, when I say next year, this year, we expect industrial side to be up about 5% and then we expect our residential and commercial will be down, and be down around 1% something like that, and that nets out all the energy efficiency. So, we've been having great success on energy efficiency. And don't forget, we are fortunate in our state to be able to earn incentives around that work and that's been about $17 million, $18 million a year, which is on top of our authorized ROE. The new law will permit us to almost double that when we get a full year effect. So, we're really happy with how that plays out. Now, for this year, we ended up the year, the fourth quarter, with residential down a touch, commercial flat and industrial up. And so, industrial was up about 1.5%. And so, we ended up the year about roughly 0.5% up. We've seen a mixture of things going on out there in this last quarter, and I'll try to give you just a little bit of a feel about it. In the industrial side, on plastics, we saw good growth. Fabricated steel, good growth, better than planned. On the auto side, that growth is continued. Cautionary tale though because we're seeing the actual sales flatten out a little bit for auto at probably record levels for many of them, but still, in terms of growth, flattening out. We saw similar utilities that we serve doing really well. And then, in food, that was mixed. So, we saw some of our companies and customers doing really well and some backing off just a little bit. And then on chemicals, we saw things ease off. So, we have quite a mix on the industrial side. Here's what we are reading. We see apprehension. First excitement. Now don't think the stock market, think about our customers and what they're doing in their businesses. We saw a lot of excitement and then the fourth quarter kind of eased off on some uncertainty. I think this first quarter is going to be an important one to watch because we're going to see what confidence is out there on the consumer side and we're going to see what our businesses do. And I wouldn't be surprised if some of them hold back a little bit trying to get a better feel for tax reform, money they may bring in from overseas and what they're going to do with their investment programs. But what I will tell you, when we go talk to our major customers face-to-face, even though there's a little trepidation, they're pretty upbeat. So, I think we're in for a good year and a 1% growth is probably a very reasonable place to be. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Last question, Tom. Just looking at your 2017 guidance by the various segments, can you remind us why the electric utility results in 2017 will be done versus what you earned in 2016? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, I think that is oversimplified and just say on the electric side, we had good weather. So, we had a lot of good help in the summer. And so, the comp is probably a little bit tougher when you're looking at just the bottom lines. On the gas side, it was a bit the reverse. We had a very mild start. If you remember last year, and then an okay ending to the year. So the comps are little bit easier. So, when you're just looking at the bottom lines, that's what you see. When you look inside the business on weather-adjusted basis, both businesses are doing quite well. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. When I'm looking at the... Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Patti, Tom. The tax slide, I mean, there's a scenario where you have significant headroom in customer bills. Have you started the conversation with the Commission yet about may be accelerating some capital? Or is it just too early from that because... Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: It's too early. Lot our peers for getting out there and trying very hard to describe what this will mean, and we've been equally trying hard to describe what could happen because it's important. But that challenge is, I think we're six months away before you even begin to get traction on what's going to be in here and how it will affect our industry. So, for us, at this stage to say we know enough, let's go start work with the Commission, I think that's premature. Now, we will work with them and tell them all about what we do know and try to keep them onboard with how normalization might work and all these important things. But it's too soon for us to suggest to them, okay, now, we ought to start timing more CapEx in because we may get some funding from the federal government. I think that will come about six months from now. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: And, look, the thing I would add, Paul, is, you've nailed the intent here. For us, because we have a deep well of high-value CapEx, small bets that we can make to continue to incrementally improve our system, it doesn't concern us. We look at this as it is a potential opportunity that plays right into our business model. So, we're hopeful that this creates more opportunity for us. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: But am I kind of reading the sentiment of the Commission right that they know you're underinvested and are supportive of all the investment you're doing? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: What I would say is, it's been very clear, both the Commission has been clear with us as well as the Governor's focus on infrastructure investment in Michigan. And as they're looking at things like roads and water, I think they're relieved to know that there's a good system for electric infrastructure and natural gas infrastructure where there's visibility, transparency, good regulation, a good funding mechanism, this is a good model that we get a lot of support for the kind of investments that are required on our system. I mean, we definitely are committed to having a safe natural gas deliverable system. And that's probably some of our highest risk assets, the idea that we've got support from the Governor and the Commission to do investment in those areas is very important to us. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then just switching gears, any incremental contracting activity at DIG? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, for DIG, we're right in the middle of all this work on the Palisades PPA early termination and replacement. And what's near and dear to us as it is to our Commission is getting the capacity side right, so there's no mistake and then flowing through all these wonderful rate reductions. I mean, it's hard to get rate reductions at this magnitude. So, we are just tickled about all of that. So, when you look at DIG, we are still in the thinking stage. Is it better if we put DIG in the utility both for accretion and for certainty of the capacity or is it better that we keep it outside providing that sort of emergency backup if it was needed in a fashion as well as the business that we know. There is good interest. The upsides of DIG still look attractive. People are still interested in doing more capacity contracts with us. But we're not doing those right now because we're making sure that that backup plan is available to us. Certainty of delivering power is critical to us and then right behind that's the big customer savings that we get. So, I'm giving an awfully mushy answer. I normally don't do that because we haven't made the decision, but I would tell you, either inside of the utility or outside of the utility, there's some upside available from DIG. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And what are you seeing \u2013 you're obviously being approached, what are you seeing as far as offers, for DIG capacity? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, I'd say, the low $4 levels for contracts that might go out over several years. So, I think that's a pretty good place to be in. So, in other words, there's good demand, but we're not rushed in any way. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, and, Paul, what I would add is that we're in the process with the Commission. They issued an order on January 20 and we're building out and aligning around what is the backfill plan for Palisades. And that's important. DIG is an important piece of that puzzle. And so, obviously, overall reliability for the state of Michigan is both ours and the Commission's number one priority. And so, we're going to be working together over the next several months to agree upon that backfill plan. And we'll be doing tests on a variety of options that we're recommending with more demand response, more energy efficiency, potentially some additional coal to gas switching but also then looking at DIG as a major part of our backfill plan for Palisades. We've always said that with our Ferrari in the garage, it is still and it's revving up. And so it's got a job to do here to make sure that Michigan has the adequate resource and supply going forward with the retirement and early termination of our agreement with Entergy and Palisades. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: So, we're just being a little quiet because it's actually a Tesla and you can hardly hear those things. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Tom, you stole the words right out of my mouth. I was about to make a Tesla comment. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Greg. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Couple questions. First, just to review what you said on coming out of the gate here going into the year on earnings. You say that that you were sort of $0.03 ahead of where you would have expected because of property tax. And that the passage of the energy law gave you an opportunity for an incremental $0.02 from energy efficiency incentives. And then base lining that off the potential for a 10.1% ROE, you'd sort of subtract $0.03 from that, so you'd be net $0.02? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Yes. Yeah. You took really good notes. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yes. He did say that. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. I just wanted to be sure I didn't miss them, get them backwards or miss it or anything like that. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: No. You got it exactly right. But what I was doing there was just trying to illustrate candidly the ups and downs that we face all the time. There's nothing unusual on those. But also, to be fair, I was trying to foreshadow a little bit, what if the ROA or ROE comes in at about 10.1%, would that be a big problem for us? No. That's the point. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : No. I understand. You guys manage the business extremely well as always. On the tax thing, I hear you that there's ton of uncertainty and we're all trying to model this and it's all fraught with error. Looking at your tax slide and then sort of just corroborating that by looking at the earnings guidance slide on page 16, I mean I'm a little bit confused about it. I mean, I know theoretically if we had elimination of interest deductibility, but then the law said you could net interest income against interest expense. That would clearly insulate you from an impact. But if all that happened was we said the federal income tax rate goes down by, let's say, 15% from 35% to 20% and I look at enterprises currently expected to earn $0.09. I mean pro forma that's $0.11. And if take the parent and other overheads are $0.25 dragged, then I would just sort of gross that up for 15% reduction in your tax yield, right? So that's theoretically another scenario amongst a million other scenarios, or am I not thinking about that correctly? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Yes. And I just want to make sure you got the pieces because in the parent and other line, when you're looking at that, it is about $0.10 around EnerBank. So, it's small. It's like 5% of our earnings roughly, but you need to do what you just did mentally to that part of the business as well, because inside of that $0.10 is the $130 million of what we think of is more like revenue, but it is interest income. That's how we get the revenue. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. I got it. So, the $0.09 is enterprises - Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: You got it? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : There is another $0.05 that's EnerBank. So, really you're - Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: No. No. $0.10. So, 5%. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : $0.10. Sorry. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: $0.10. Yeah. No problem. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So, your non-regulated businesses that would benefit from a lower federal income tax rate are really generating like $0.19 and the interest expense at the parent is 35%, not 25%. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Right. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. I understand. I'll follow up with you offline, Tom, because some of this is complex and I don't want to take up too much time on the call. I appreciate it. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: It is complex. And I'd be happy. I read your report this morning, so I'd be happy to follow up. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I already realized. I probably might have overstated the impact on CMS but it's like you said it's extreme complex. The one other thing that I wanted to ask because you mentioned it and you're the only utility so far to mention it, that's another nuance of the tax question, is the cash flow issue with the NOLs. So, if your federal income tax collections go down at the utility level, that's obviously incredibly constructive for customers. It creates more than ample headroom for you to increase your capital expenditures to offset the impact of bonus deprecation should that also occur. But you rightly pointed out. It would also reduce your parent cash flows, right? So, you mentioned that you might be able to accelerate AMT credits to offset that. But if you can't offset it, doesn't that mean you have to go to the next highest sort of next lowest cost of capital option on the balance sheet, which would mean issuing more debt or some equity to fill the hole? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Right. No question. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Honestly, you're the first CFO in any of the calls to even bring it up and so thank you for that. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, let's just elaborate so that we are all clear. At the end of last year, there's about $1 billion of NOLs. And when you have a 35% tax yield like we do today that's worth more than if we had, pick you number, 20% tax yield right? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: So, what we'll all have to do is take non-cash hit, whoever has NOLs and credit strength. In year one of the tax reform, we'll have to drive a non-cash hit to reflect whatever that is, that difference, right through the income statement. I assume everybody will want to adjust that out, but what's useful for us on the NOLs is that we have a long enough life and we're positioned well enough that we're not going lose the use of them. So, we'll still get them but they're only worth $0.20 on the dollar instead of 35% on the dollar. And on the AMTs presently, we plan to use those toward the end of our tax planning, but in this scenario, and again, who knows what it'll be but I'm guessing in this scenario we could lose access to those AMT credits. And for us, there's roughly $300 million. Well, rather than do that, we'll reconstruct how much we use bonus depreciation this year and last year for tax reporting. And we'll work in the AMT credits so we don't lose that $300 million, but we'll do it in a way so our customers at the utility are whole. We wouldn't ask them to take any penalty in this process. So, we feel pretty good about what we can do, but gosh, we got to figure out what it really, really is first before we can adjust our tax planning. So, we've got six months, I think, of Washington D.C. work before something settles out. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hey, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : No question. Thank you for being so clear. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Greg. Here's what's also pretty clear. 6% to 8%. After all that. So, we know, you know that that's what we're always working. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : If there's any company that's positioned to figure out how to continue to execute and meet their plans, it's probably you guys but we still got to figure out how you get there. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Zhou, Avon Capital Advisors. Your line is open. Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Hi. It's Andy Levi. I'm all set. Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hey, Andy. Thanks. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Nice to hear your voice though. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathon Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, good morning, guys. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hey, Jon. Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Can I just ask about the Palisades regulatory process at the MPSC? And seems they've asked for more information a couple of times now. And can you just talk about what you think is going on there, and when do you anticipate making the actual securitization filing? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: You bet. They asked in December. They basically told us in December in their December 20 order that they were going to be asking. And then on January 20, they did ask and set a timetable for information that they were looking for. As you can imagine, they're biggest concern, and it's our concern too, is to assure that we have resource adequacy in Michigan. We do have a nice securitization law in Michigan that makes a proceeding like this limited in the amount of appeals. And so there's some real advantages to making sure that we ask and answer all these questions so that when the Commission approves the securitization application, they really understand what are the customer benefits and savings and that we have adequate resource. And so, the Commission have asked for basically additional time through the end of August to go through that entire proceeding, but it's all under the umbrella of the securitization. So, by the end of August, we expect an order outlining the agreements. Yeah. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Patti. And then, if I may just on tax. Tom, I want to just make sure I understand one aspect of your slide 22. So, I presume the backfill is less at a lower tax rate because in that scenario, you have more of a refund of the excess deferred tax balance and therefore less of an offset to rate base. Is that correct? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Exactly right. So, you do your asset expensing but at that different tax benefit level. You had it perfect. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So then, just following up on that, would you share with us what your excess deferred income tax balance is today and what your assumption is around the likely timing of it being normalized, is that the right word? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. No, I don't have that number in front of me, but I can tell you I don't pay too much attention to it for this reason. Whenever that number turns out to be at the time, so that will depend on what the law says for how it changes, we're assuming normalization and approximately a 30-year recovery period. It all has to happen too. The federal government has to say we're going to continue the normalization process. And then we assume it would follow for utilities, your plant type depreciation levels. So, whatever the number is, I have a number here but I think it would be kind of meaningless, that goes over a 30-year period. The only reason I say it's meaningless, so different in every single scenario we look at. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Well, thank you for that and thanks for the call and all the extra color. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe. Your line is open. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Oh, I'm good. Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Liou of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the information on tax reform. Just wondering can you just give us high level what is the cash flow impact of all your assumptions, tax rate, et cetera, like directionally or anyway really. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I do it like this. I'm going to break it into businesses again, okay? So, at the utility, we're assuming backfill for whatever is opened up with the federal government. So, if you just think of that in a big picture as neutral cash flow because we'll need to do it soon. We'll have to do it early on in the process. Now, go over to a little business like enterprises, the non-utility business. We'll see the kick up in terms of benefit just like every non-utility would see, which should be pretty normal. But since we already aren't in a position of paying taxes, then you're not going to see a tax cash flow change, if you're with me on that, right? Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Because we're already in a position where we don't pay taxes. And then on EnerBank, that'll actually see a kick up because now instead of paying taxes on the profit that we would make there, inside of that business unit, we'll see that that gets offset with a netting with parent interest. So, they'll get good news but then when we consolidate it up to the company, we already assume we're not paying any taxes. So, I'm trying to tell you that there's not going to be much of a cash hurt or help. The big write-offs we do around the NOLs that was asked about earlier in AMT credits. So, I think that's how that works. It's a non-cash thing. But we'll turnaround on the AMT credits, and we'll try to get advantage of those upfront, and so everyone might conclude, great, $300 million of better cash flow. It depends on what you compare to. This is just substituting for bonus depreciation, so there's really no change to cash flow. So, not a lot of change early on is my answer. And I made it complicated because it really is complicated and then you compare it to where you are today where you don't pay taxes, which we love, by the way. I think this is a great country. Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Definitely. That's great. Thank you for all the color. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Any other questions? Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you, Joey. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CMS Energy 2017 First Quarter Results and Outlook Call. The earnings new release issued earlier today and the presentation used in the webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. Just a reminder, there will be rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 1 :00 PM Eastern Time running through May 8. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you, Keith. Well, I'm sure many of you saw the news this morning. Tom Webb has announced his retirement after 15 years here at CMS Energy. Tom's shoes are awfully big to fill, so we were very discerning in our replacement. It is my privilege to introduce Rejji Hayes, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, joining us with a decade of experience in our industry at both Exelon and ITC, following his time at Lazard and Bank of America. Rejji is a great addition to the CMS Energy family. Now, you know we take succession planning very seriously here. This news is just another example of how we prepare for orderly transitions of our management team. In fact, at my very first board meeting as CEO, I discussed my own potential successors. We require that our senior executives retire at the age of 65, and Tom is nearing that time. We are right on plan. Tom has been named Vice Chairman and will work with Rejji and the rest of the management team for the next six months to assure a smooth transition. We still have lots of work for Tom to do, so don't be in too much of a hurry to say goodbye just yet. We have plenty of time for that between now and November. In fact, Tom, Rejji and I will see many of you next week during our road show. Both Tom and I have confidence, and you should, too, that the team, now including Rejji, will continue to deliver the consistent financial results that you have come to expect. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, and thank you. Thank you for joining us today. Patti, Rejji and I are pleased to be with you today. And, Rejji, let me add my warm welcome to you. Now, more to the mundane sort of things. Please keep in mind, the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk, as well as uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risk and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the Appendix, and they're posted on our website. Now, let me turn the call back over to Patti. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you, Tom. I'll be covering our first quarter results. I'll talk about our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit, underpinned by world-class performance, enabled by our Consumers Energy Way. Stand by because I will also share my story of the month, as always, and Tom will cover our results and outlook. We're off to a strong start for the year in spite of a mild winter and several storms. We're up $0.12 over 2016, and when we weather normalize, that's up over 20% or $0.14. We're reaffirming our full-year adjusted guidance for 2017 at 68% or $2.14 to $2.18. We can sustainably and consistently deliver this performance by remaining true to our stand for people, planet and profit, underpinned by world-class performance. When we say people, we mean our customers, our communities, our co-workers and other critical stakeholders. And our commitment to the planet is demonstrated by our track record of going above and beyond environmental regulation to leave the planet better than we found it. We do not compromise profitability in these pursuits because we believe in the end around here. Our triple bottom line is made possible because we are squarely focused on world-class performance, and it underpins everything we do. Given the passage of the energy law at the end of 2016 and its implementation in flight, it's very helpful that Governor Snyder reinforced the stability and strength of our Michigan Public Service Commission by extending Chairman Talberg's term to July 2021. This was enabled by swapping terms with Commissioner Saari. The Governor also reappointed Commissioner Eubanks to July of 2023. The new law serves our customers very well and strengthens our regulatory construct in Michigan. We're working with the Commission to implement several aspects such as the new energy efficiency and waste reduction standard, the 10-month filing calendar, the 15% renewable portfolio standard, and the new state reliability mechanism. In addition, we have active gas and electric rate cases, as well as our Palisades early termination securitization filing. We've asked a lot of our Commission and their staff. Their continuity and experience is a real advantage, and we're thankful to have such professionals in place. We gauge our effectiveness with our customers through their feedback to us. We're proud of the improvements for both our residential and our business customers. Our customers are noticing that we're continuously improving their experience. Despite our progress, however, we are still dissatisfied. Our customer feedback scores put us very close to the best in our industry, but are still over 200 points on a 1,000-point scale from perfect. We are in pursuit of world-class, and won't be satisfied until we demonstrate excellence in every interaction with our customers and when they believe that we are, in fact, the very best. One area where our customers and others are taking note is the transformation of our generation fleet. As you can see, we've made big progress in reducing our reliance on coal for both capacity and energy by retiring more coal plants than any other investor on utility, and investing in renewable, as well as fully utilizing our low-cost gas plants. We call this our Clean & Lean approach. It seems to make sense for people that when we say clean, it reflects our commitment to the planet by replacing our coal plants with investments in renewable assets and gas plants. People do still ask us, however, what we mean when we say lean. Lean, the heart of Consumers Energy Way, reflects the commitment to waste elimination and improving our performance at the same time, not just cost reduction for cost reduction's sake. For example, we could have built a brand-new oversized gas plant to replace our coal units, but instead, we purchased a low-cost under-utilized gas plant. We are fully utilizing it now and running it really well. This saved our customers over $0.5 billion, allowed us to deploy our capital to an area of greater value, and reduced our carbon footprint simultaneously. Like all things we tackle, we serve people, the planet, and profit. No trade-offs. Our MCV PPA expires in 2025, which may seem a ways off, but it's actually just around the corner from a generation and supply planning perspective. The replacement of that PPA will provide a great opportunity to deploy our Clean & Lean strategy, and transition from an expensive PPA, in this case, to a significant renewable capital investment in the $3 billion zone at a lower cost for customers and in a modular phase-in to match demand, a great example of Clean & Lean. On March 8, we experienced one of the worst wind events in Michigan's history. Approximately one in three people in Michigan were affected, and it's times like these when our team is at its best. In fact, we had several utility executives, as well as our Governor, reach out to congratulate us on our performance and asked us how we did it. We're very proud of our team for their extraordinary performance. Our customers don't hold us accountable for Mother Nature, but they do want to know what to expect during an outage. We are finding that they want to have frequent and accurate conversations with us during a major event. A shout-out to our customer service reps who handled over 116,000 calls during the storm, our IT team who supports our outage map, which took 355 hits per second on the first day of the storm, and our social media team who answered every single posting personally, 24 hours a day, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. This is a new standard in capability for us. And that isn't even my story of the month. Smart meters during storms is my story for this month. Smart meters are part of the answer to how our performance continues to improve during major events. During a separate event in April, our traditional tools told us that our Nashville, Vermontville circuit showed a full circuit lockout, and 1,175 customers on that circuit were without power. Our ability to proactively ping those meters allowed for remote confirmation that only 178 of those customers were actually out of power. In the past, we would've run trucks for all those outages. Imagine the waste we eliminated by more surgically being able to determine the location of the interruptions. We would've wasted time and valuable resources needed in other areas of the restoration effort. We were able to accurately quantify that we reduced over 3,000 hours of customer interruption and over 50 truck rolls as a result of this one circuit and one storm, thanks to our smart meters. We don't even have our meters fully deployed yet. That's scheduled to occur by year-end. The value of our investment in the cellular technology is just beginning to materialize. It's our favorite kind of capital investment, one that improves the customer experience at a lower operating cost, and provides a real return to you, our investors. We have a proven track record to deliver for you in spite of the changes in the economy, storms, policymakers, and company leadership. This just confirms we, in fact, have a CMS Energy Way, continuously improving everything we do. Take it away, Tom. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Patti, and thank you, again, for joining us today, everyone. This is our 15th year of earnings calls with consistent adjusted earnings growth averaging more than 7% a year, and as usual, there are no surprises in our results. Our first quarter earnings are up $0.12 or 20%. While this includes another mild winter and record-storm damage, we offset fully, the challenges to deliver another strong quarter. On a weather-normalized basis, 2017 earnings are up $0.14 or 20%. You can see the favorable comparison of 2017 with 2016 first quarter results on this waterfall chart. Operations are performing well. Our cost reductions are ahead of plan, and our enterprises and interbank businesses also are ahead of plan. By managing our work well, we offset the adverse weather and storm impact to $0.04 in the first quarter. The storm cost was $30 million, our insurance offset was $11 million. The O&M portion of the storm cost, net of the insurance, was $10 million or $0.02 a share. Cost savings of $0.08 included property tax savings of $0.03, coal plant retirement savings of $0.02, a variety of lean process improvements at $0.015, and stock-based compensation accounting benefits of another $0.015. While we early adopted the new Accounting Standard 2016-09 last year, we benefited another $6 million this quarter. This simply reflects shares added routinely as well as the higher price of our stock. Favorable rate increases, net of associated capital investment, helped another $0.02, and favorable utility sales combined with strong business performance at enterprises helped another $0.06. While our weather-normalized sales were up 1.2% in the quarter, without the benefit of the leap year day in 2016, they would have been up a little more than 2%. These sales results bode well for our full-year forecast increase of a little less than 1%. Our total year-to-year earnings improvement for the quarter was $0.12 a share, again, or 20%, as you can see our progress for the rest of the year is strong. Here's how the earnings per share forecast curve looks this year. I know many of you are familiar with this curve that projects our earnings per share growth for the full year at any point during the year. We fully offset the adverse weather in the first quarter with excellent performance, and look forward to strong results for the year. We were able to accelerate some attractive financing and make use of higher energy efficiency incentives that are permitted under our new energy law. Sales mix also is stronger than expected. Other examples include continuing reductions in uncollectable accounts, in part because customer bills will be lower after the mild winter, but in part because of the continuing strong Consumers Energy Way process improvement. Our 2017 performance is a continuation of what we've done over a long period of time. Our track record of earnings per share growth has been at 7% a year, year after year after year. And imagine during the last four years, we reinvested in O&M one-third of the $1 billion for our customers. Half of this was made possible by favorable weather, half by cost reductions; cost reductions much better than we originally had planned. Here's the model that makes possible a consistent 7% earnings per share growth over the last decade and the next. With our extensive inventory of self-funded organic capital investment projects, abundant cost reduction opportunities and a diverse economy, you can see why this works, especially with continued focus on process improvements and cost reductions. This model can continue for many years to come. Here's the customer-driven capital investment plan that's included in our model for the next 10 years. We're investing $18 billion to improve performance, with better service and better value for our customers. Here's what it looks like with additional opportunities that could increase our capital investment to $21 billion. This includes enhanced gas infrastructure, grid modernization, replacement of PPAs, like our Palisades contract, and more renewables. And here, you can see that the opportunity could be as much as $7 billion, reaching $25 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. This reflects our Clean & Lean strategy with more emphasis on renewables during the course of the next decade. The model is sustainable over many years, and is made possible by lean thinking and lean performance. As you can see on the left of this slide, we've been a bit of a leader in this area, and each year, we come up with new and innovative ways to deliver those savings for our customers. For investors, this creates capital investment headroom. For customers, cost reductions have been and continue to be an important part of our self-funded model. There are lots of ups and downs. We include them all and deliver net savings. We don't adjust for things that do seem out of our control. Over the last decade, we've been able to reduce our O&M cost by more than 3% a year. We've continued that over the last three years. We're projecting to continue this pace at about 2%. With our underpromise/overdeliver mentality, I'll leave the actual results a bit to your imagination. That's O&M. We eliminate waste, whether it's O&M, capital investment or fuel, and we self-fund a portion of the investment with tax savings. Base rate increases stay low, and we grow cash flow resources to support a healthy necessary capital structure. Over the last dozen years, our operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million each year. Since 2004, it's increased from $353 million to $2.1 billion last year. Over the next five years, operating cash flow will grow about $800 million to $2.9 billion. Our NOLs, bonus depreciation and AMT credits, amongst several tax planning tools, help us avoid the need for block equity. If tax reform occurs, we expect we'll still have time to use our NOLs, although at a lower rate. We also would expect to access our AMT credits early. With or without tax reform, we believe that we're in an excellent position to avoid the need for block equity to fund our planned investments for some time. We do all of this to improve the lot of our customers. We've been reducing rates rapidly. Industrial rates were 26% above our Midwest peers just a few years ago. We've reduced that by 20 points and plan to keep going. Our business electric customer satisfaction is up 22% since 2010, and we intend to improve that much, much more. Process improvements to the Consumers Energy Way make it possible. Beyond the utility, our enterprise business continues to grow. Potential upsides are shown here on this familiar slide. We are experiencing winning bids in the bilateral market for the 2018 planning year at around $4.25 per kilowatt month, a nice upside for our plan. It's not yet been determined how much of our capacity upside, if any, may be needed for the utility, either by contract or asset sales. This is part of the assessment being conducted with our Commission over the next several months. This is our sensitivity slide for the total company. We provide this update each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospects. You can see, with reasonable planning assumptions and with robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan minimized. There are always ups and downs. Already, this year, property taxes are lower than we expected, and we anticipate further opportunities at other locations. The opportunity for energy efficiencies incentives are doubled under our new energy law. Being conservative, we've included half the increase in our forecast. We have shown here another $0.02 opportunity yet to be reflected. The rating agencies appreciate our approach. As you can see here, both S&P and Fitch, who upgraded us last year, have stable outlooks on our credit rating. Moody's just upgraded our ratings another notch at CMS Energy and the utility. So, what makes this consistent improvement possible? We just stay focused on our business model. It is simple and perhaps, it's a little unique, but we believe it provides a good opportunity to continue making improvements for our investors and our customers for the decade ahead. Our organic capital investment has grown, driving our adjusted earnings per share growth to a bit better than 7% every year. Because we don't make any adjustments, our operating cash flow grows at the same pace. Another part of our model that might be a little unique is that we work hard to reduce our O&M cost every year, not to improve profits, but rather to self-fund a good portion of our capital investment for our customers. With base rate increases at or below the level of inflation, this is a model that provides customers with improvements from investments without asking to raise their rates unreasonably. This makes the model sustainable for the decade ahead. As you can see here, this model has been recognized by many of you, our investors, and it is our intention to continue our strong business performance in a manner that improves a lot of our customers every day. We believe this can result in adjusted earnings per share growth of 68% a year, a commensurate increase in our dividend, and continued healthy performance of our stock. Here's our latest report card for 2017 and beyond. We anticipate another great year this year and for many years to come. With no big debts and robust risk mitigation, we believe our model serves our customers and you well. Few companies have been able to deliver top-end earnings growth while improving value and service for customers every year, year after year after year. We're pleased to have another fast start to another outstanding performance in 2017, and expect the same for years to come. Our focus on world-class performance, delivering hometown service, permits us to improve each and every year. We can and will continue this improvement. It's our passion for you and our customers. Thank you, again, for your support for the last 15 years. Thank you for your confidence in our future. Patti, Rejji, and I will leave it better than we found it. Operator, would you please open the line? Operator : Thank you very much, Mr. Webb. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Our first question comes from Jerimiah Booream with UBS. Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations, Tom, and welcome, Rejji. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning. Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC : And at the risk of stating the obvious, Tom, I would say your tenure has earned a smiley face. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Very nice. Lots of smiley faces. We agree. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: We'll toss a starburst later. Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC : So, just on the DIG side, particularly with the recent MISO capacity auction, can we just talk through kind of what your thought process is there and how this impacts DIG economics, whether it's in rate base or outside of it? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. That's a good question because we actually don't have the specific answer today, but I can frame it for you. So, we are in a process right now that the Public Service Commission is conducting, which could have DIG providing for some of the short-term sales, and it could have DIG actually being purchased into the utility. But that will depend on all the competitive bids that are out there, and it's a third-party process since it's an affiliate. So, it's one that's being conducted by somebody else, not by us, and we'll be watching that with great interest. So, what I would tell you is we're very prepared to have DIG outside the utility because we see these opportunities that show on the yellow bar on slide 23, where you can kind of figure out from what I said, we're approaching that $20 million upside as it is in the near couple of years. But we're also happy if it ends up inside the utility through this process. Because if it does, it will go in at a fair price that's, one, good for our customers, so it meets the needs of replacing the Palisades Plant, saving them a lot of money, as we've projected, but it will also be attractive to investors because it would be at a profitable level. And that's the level, of course, that would be bid into that process. So, that gives you the framework. If it's in the utility or if it's outside the utility, it's really a nice opportunity for us. Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. That makes sense. And then just one other one. On the $25 billion upside that you guys are discussing here, would that be more focused on any particular region, distribution, gas infrastructure or supply, or kind of similar to how it's laid out in 2018 to 2021? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. The big addition in that from our current plan to the future plan are those additional renewables that I talked about. It would be as a result of the MCV PPA replacement. So, that's a big opportunity for us to grow our plan. And so that would obviously be generation resources. We still have additional substantial gas infrastructure investments to make, however, as well. And so what we are always working to optimize is making sure that we pick our highest value CapEx and minimize rate impacts to customers. So, lower costs, really focused on affordability, and then picking our CapEx that does the balancing. Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks, and congratulations again. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I'm also adding my congratulations on a very successful tenure and wishing you all the best for the future as well. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. You were one of the first early buys. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. First question. Patti, on this \u2013 or Tom as well, the $18 billion to $21 billion to $25 billion opportunity, as you look at that, in the past, as you've said many times, two of the constraints that you look at in terms of planning your CapEx are; one, customer rate impact; and two, not issuing any block equity. So keeping those constraints in mind, how much headroom do you have that you could move that $18 billion up and still keep yourself within those constraints? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Ali, I would say it like this. First of all, as we look at what grows the plan from $18 billion to $25 billion, we see these PPAs coming off that enable the CapEx without putting pressure on the affordability. In fact, it saves customers money. So, for example, our PPA with Palisades, we're going to save customers about $45 million a year even after we replace that PPA with new generating assets. So, when we look at building out the plan, we see that as the headroom creation that's required to be able to bump up the CapEx. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And what about the constraint on the block equity side? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: So, same thing. Here's the wonderful twofer that we get out of this. When we do things that make this self-funding for our customer, it generally makes it self-funding in the cash flow as well. So, we get the twofer out of that because we get savings that flow through. So, it protects us from the need for block equity, right, and it also protects us from the need for having our rates go up very fast for our customers. That's part of the end on what we're doing. So, I would say where we are is in great shape. Now, if we were to add $7 billion and it didn't have offsets, that'd be a different story. And that can always happen where I assume, we'd have a really good project to show you and it would make good sense, and you'd want to make the incremental investment, so the block equity would make sense. But today, we're pretty comfortable right where we are. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then second question, this investment recovery mechanism, IRMs, that you tried those last couple of rate cycles as well, what's the appetite that you're seeing in the state right now for that as we're going through the gas case and the electric to follow? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, one of the things that came out of the energy law, Ali, that passed at the end of 2016 is a study on the part of the Commission for a performance-based rate making and new rate designs, and when they \u2013 and a couple multiyear CapEx strategy reviews. So, for example, we're doing a five-year distribution modernization collaborative with the Commission. So, I would suggest that there's interest in looking at longer-term CapEx planning as it rewards customers. And so, I would think that as we work with the Commission further on having better visibility to multi-year plans, it makes it a lot easier for a Commission to agree to a multi-year investment recovery mechanism. We do have one in our gas structure today in our enhanced infrastructure replacement program. It's about $75 million annual program to replace mains and distributions, and that has a true-up annually, we've been achieving it. And so, we're getting a good track record. So, I would just suggest that, I think, there's going to be opportunities for us to work through the Commission and with the Commission to modernize our rate-making and give more visibility to the long-term investments that reward customers. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. And last question, Tom, you alluded to this. The 1.2% growth in electric weather-normalized, not sure, it may be too early to predict the trend, but anything that stood out that may be showing strength, a stronger sale than you may be expecting in any of your customer classes? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: I mean, I would just say too soon. I'll give you the facts, but you know us, we're pretty conservative. We saw, for this quarter, a nice uptick on residential. You can see it in the data, that's just below 1%. We saw commercial up almost 3%. But then industrial was kind of flat. Now, we know the industrial side and we know who the extra people are that are hooking up or who is down. So, we're still comfortable with our guidance for the year on the industrial side, that's around 4% growth. But we are not putting in to our full-year forecast, this uptick that we're seeing on residential and commercial. We're still going to show those as down. Now, we may be wrong, but it's my theory in life, one quarter does not make a year, especially when you're looking at sales. I'd like to get another quarter under our belt, see what's really happening before we make any upside adjustments to that. So, our full-year forecast is still in that zone of something between 0.5% and 1% I would make a note that I was surprised, somebody called us and asked us about the leap year day last year. And again, we don't really pay a lot of attention to those sort of things, but we checked it out and we said, oh, yeah. So, the uptick that we saw in the first quarter, 1.2%, if you adjust out the leap year from last year, the day, it's 2.3%. But I would caution everybody, please don't get too excited about the sales. We're pleased, it's helpful, but see how it goes. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Mike Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hey, Mike. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Hey. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Or maybe on one of those coins that we give out. We'll put his face on that. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Maybe a bottle covered with stars and smiley faces as Jerimiah said. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Jerimiah. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: How much cheaper does wind turbine technology need to get to make the plant to replace MCV economically viable without tax credits? And then what are the next steps you have to take with regulators to roll this into the formal capital plan? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: So, with the tax credits, we're very comfortable that this is a profitable enterprise for us and it's cheaper for our customers. Without the tax credits, it's a closer call. So, what we don't have factored into our thinking is, will the turbines get better? Will they be more efficient? Because, remember, a lot of these that we're talking about are something for years 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. We're further out. We're a long ways out. So, for some of those opportunities, we may see some technology improvements that eventually make that tax credit not needed. I cannot tell you that is in hand today at the capacity factors that we look at. Now, there are some people with capacity factors down in the Oklahoma Panhandle and maybe up in Montana, which are making that pretty close. So, I'd say in our neck of the woods, we have some more work to do. And then I think maybe for the Commission in the process that we would follow, I'll pass that over to Patti for a couple of comments. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. So, we think that working with the Commission and looking at the renewable portfolio standard, as well some renewable rate packages for industrial customers, we launched or we will be launching May 12, a proposal with the Commission for a renewable tariff for our large business customers. One of the interesting things with renewables right now that we're observing is that our large industrial customers, particularly those that are brand-facing, are very interested in us working with them to provide renewables. So, for example, General Motors, our Switch data centers, they've made public commitments to 100% renewables, and they want those renewables to be additive. So, our Cross Winds, the expansion that we're underway right now, is going to be fulfilling the needs of Switch for the data center that they built in Grand Rapids to provide the additive renewable generation to serve their load. And so, we do think that there will be ratemaking that goes into the formula as well. And so, it's an exciting time, and I do think our Clean & Lean strategy is well placed with the demands of customers, their desires, as well as the ability to replace our high-cost PPAs right now. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Great. Thanks. And also, safe to say, with DIG contracting at about $4.25 a kilowatt a month, is that \u2013 is it fair to say that you're relatively unaffected by the recent low MISO capacity auction results? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Here's what I would say about the MISO auction. I'm sure there's going to be \u2013 there are who have questions about the MISO auction. This is what we observed, that the low cost or the low price in that MISO auction tells us a couple of things. One, it says that MISO is predominantly regulated, and so there was definitely a low-price bidding strategy. However, I think it also is fair to say that a one-year forward auction is not a good telltale for generation-planning and resource adequacy. Last year's Zone 7, as you all know, was at $72 a megawatt day. And when we compare that, obviously, to this year's $150, we saw more energy efficiency and demand response. We'll be studying Zone 7 more in detail specifically. But what it tells us is that it's not a good planning tool. It can be a red flag, it can be a warning bell, but it's a warning bell that's too late. And so, we're very grateful that we passed the energy law at the end of 2016. We really thought the FERC was going to approve the MISO three-year auction. And when they didn't, it was great that the energy law had gone into place because it provides the three-year visibility, in fact, four years of visibility for both the utilities and the alternative energy suppliers for who's providing the load. And so, the transparency, the forward-looking nature of the process that's been put in place by the Commission is going to serve a much better forward-looking telltale than the MISO auction currently does. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's great. Thank you very much, and I look forward to working with you again, Rejji. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Me too. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. Bye. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning, all. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hey, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Hey, Rejji. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Hi, Greg. How are you? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Congratulations. Really seriously, well deserved move on to your next big Bordeaux winery. But the \u2013 a question again on this \u2013 the RFP for a new gas plant. I mean, are the potential bidders, do they all have to be Michigan-based facilities or can someone choose to bid by wheeling power in to the state? And if so, does that mean essentially that DIG is theoretically competing against new builds since there's basically no other plants in the state that are open capacity? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, obviously, the results aren't complete yet. We will see. If someone were to build something, I would say they'd have to have proven transmission that they could import. And so, there are certainly limits to that currently and constraints on how much can be imported into Zone 7, which is the Michigan's Lower Peninsula. So, we'll \u2013 DIG is obviously a viable candidate. We'll see how it stacks up against the other offers. And like in the past, if there's a more economic solution for customers, we'll take it. We'll use the data to make a good decision. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. And then at what point do we get sort of a definitive regulatory timeline for the next phase of looking at MCV? I know you've chosen now is the time to sort of articulate that transition and that opportunity. Why are you articulating that to us now? In other words, like how close are we to starting down the path of trying to find that solution? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. So, 2025 does feel like a long time away. That's when the contract expires. However, we have to plan for that. We're always doing forward-looking planning. And as we build out that generation strategy, and we're really trying to explore what are the limits to Clean & Lean, we see this as a key \u2013 it will be the big next step change for us in generation replacement. And so, as we looked at does Clean & Lean hold when you're looking at 1,200 megawatts of a gas PPA, and we can see there's real potential that it could, we're just trying to reinforce that we really are serious about this generation replacement strategy. We're obviously deploying it currently on the PPA from Palisades. If we have any other short-term plant closings of our own fleet, we would also deploy it there as well. And so, we're always looking, but we want to make clear that there are future opportunities that just continue to strengthen this business model for the next decade. I think a lot of people might struggle to have a 10-year CapEx plan. And so, we like to be sure that you all are clear that it's legit. We have a legitimate plan for the 10-year time horizon that we can see that meets both the CapEx demand and the affordability commitment that we have for customers. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. That's very clear. Thank you. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Greg. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Greg. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys, and congratulations, Tom, and welcome back, Rejji. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you, Jonathan. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Good morning, Patti. A quick question on MCV and the replacement. Looking back at some of the 10-K disclosures, it looks like you're probably paying, between energy and capacity, somewhere around \u2013 over $60 a megawatt hour today. Is that number roughly right? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: So, the best way to think about it is look at what we're paying on Palisades and they're pretty similar. And it's a capacity issue in terms of pricing more than it is an energy sort of issue. And it's why, to the prior call, we've started talking about it because it's just in that 10-year horizon. So, we think that we need to at least do a heads-up. But it's early. This is way early in the game, I think, to see any transactions around that. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then I was curious, Patti, you mentioned that one of the appeals of doing wind here is that it could be modular to kind of feather in with demand. But given that you'd be replacing a PPA, why would that be a feature of how you'd want to see this? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, what will be interesting in 10 years is what's our load and what's our demand, and will it match up exactly where we are today, will it be more than where we are today, or will it be less as efficiency of motors and equipment and lighting? Does it change our mix. And so what \u2013 this whole lean idea that we would build to match more closely to demand, I think, is different. And so, I feel a need to continue to just kind of explain it and reinforce that the idea here, in the past, traditionally, utility model, you build a big generating plant and you grow into it. Your CapEx is tied up. Your operation has a big project that they're tied up in. And then you're waiting to grow in to the full utilization of that asset. And in a mature industry like ours, the idea of having underutilized major capital investments feels counterintuitive to what we've seen in other industries. And so, the idea that we would rightsize our assets to match the actual demand so that our capital is available to be deployed to other areas since we have ample need for CapEx in other parts of our system, it really is the leanest way to both deploy capital and provide the generation match to demand. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And kind of just do you \u2013 what's your best guess as to how this would look? I mean, do you have sites that you'd be looking to develop? And obviously, you'll look to do the best deal for customers, but is this something you'd kind of hope to have under rate base with the sites you already have in hand as at least one of the options? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. We saw, when we did our RFP for our Cross Winds expansion, that we were our lowest bidder. That was pretty \u2013 that helped us really realize that we are competitive in the building of generation. So, we can stay true to our commitment to customers to be the low-cost provider. And given that, we would want to build our own because we've proven ourselves competitive. Obviously, siting this volume of wind turbines, if we assume current technology, we're talking about 900 wind turbines, it would take new sites beyond what we have today. But here's the good news. First of all, in Michigan, we have \u2013 I don't know if you've been in Northern Michigan, but there's a lot of land and there's a lot of areas. We need to complete wind studies and confirm the best places. We would not rule out doing outside state generation with transmission if that was more viable for customers. But it is really early, Jonathan. We've got a lot of time, and technology can really evolve. And there's a lot of things that could happen between here and there. But as a placeholder, we think that it passes the sniff test of possibilities. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And then if I just could on \u2013 you mentioned, I think, that you'd been selling at $4.25 a kilowatt month for 2018 off of DIG. Has that been since the recent 2017 auction print or was that kind of prior to that? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Both. Both prior and after. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Okay. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. So we see the bilateral market as a much better indicator of how tight the market is. That's why we say the MISO auction is interesting and it can be a warning bell, but it's not a very good indicator of where the market really is. And the bilateral market is a much better indicator. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much, and congratulations to all. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Jonathan. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Travis. Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.: When you think out to that 10-year type period, what kind of regulatory changes might you either imagine or hope for? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, I think the idea that we would have longer-term capital planning with our Commission, that there might be opportunities for performance-based riders that we, given our Consumers Energy Way, would have total confidence in being able to stack up our operational performance to anybody and any standards that would be set. And so, we think that potentially, that would be some transitions from our current regulatory model. I could imagine pricing changes and rate design versus a per unit based pricing. Maybe there's a different way to do pricing in this business. So, when you're asking me long-term, 10 years out, that's what I'm looking at. Short-term, we've got a strong regulatory construct in Michigan, we've got a great law that was passed in December. We're in the process of implementing it. As I mentioned in the call, there's a lot of work on the Commission's plate. And so frankly, just implementing the current law is going to keep us busy for a good several years. But we are looking long term, and I think that's one of the strengths of this Commission, that they are long-term thinkers, and the extension of their terms enables them to think long-term and that's exciting, and I think it is a big strength for us here in Michigan. Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. And now, when you think about the relationship between O&M and CapEx, what does that generally look like going forward as you build things you need workers to some extent? But what does that kind of link look like? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, I think I'd encourage you to look at the total picture of what makes up a customer's price, which includes, obviously, CapEx and O&M, but also fuel. And so, when we look at the total cost for customers, we think there's big opportunity to further reduce O&M as we have a great track record to do, and we see lots of runway there, particularly with the implementation of our Consumers Energy Way, and technology advancements like smart meters and any grid modernization we might do. So, we see O&M reducing, enabled by CapEx, but we also see some fuel cost reductions, and PSCR and GCR reductions that enable affordability for customers. So, I think there's a total mix there that's important to take a look at. But when we compare CapEx projects, my favorite kind of CapEx is when we can improve safety, reliability and reduce cost at the same time, that's a winner for us on our lists. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: And I think Patti's been a little humble about the third measure on CapEx itself. We're finding productivity measures every day where we can reduce that. Now, for a normal utility, that sounds awful. But for us, that's sounds wonderful because we have so much organic CapEx catch-up to do. So, going across all three, O&M, fuel and capital investment productivity, is a great goal for us. Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.: Great. Makes sense. Thank you very much. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Travis. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, and congratulations, Tom and Rejji. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hey. Good morning, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Patti. Any early leads into recent Trump Administration tax language with regards to interest deductibility? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Really worthwhile leads? No. So, what I would say is he's come out with this broad look a week ago, which is still at the 15%. That's seemingly to be this idea of reaching a little further and compromising. I just \u2013 there's a lot more detail with people talking, but I don't think people are close enough yet to have something in Washington that's viable enough yet for us to give you any more than we already have in the last call. So, at EEI, we're trying to protect ourselves from the laws of the interest deduction, and we're trying to avoid the asset expensing all for good reasons. I would just tell you, if we're successful at that, that's great for our company. If we're not successful at that, this is still great for our company because we have the backfill of the CapEx and we have the little interbank to offset the interest expense hurt that would come on the parent side. So, tax reform to us is something that \u2013 it'll be tricky because it'll be a lot of movement, but we feel good about everything we've seen so far, pick your direction. But I'm really not able to say we really think this is the way it's going to go because I don't think anybody in Washington has got it figured out either. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I'm not sure what your maturity schedule looks like, but would you consider refinancing some debt early in case the way the law is written there, it's prospective debt and you could kind of get that refinanced prophylactically? Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, we already do sort of prefund on the parent side for two and three years out. So, we sort of do that, and that's where your question is going, is on the parent side more so, I think, in the utility. But we have looked at a program where we could take three or four years' worth or maturities. Refinance them because economically, it would be attractive before any tax reform measures. That may cause us to think about that. So, it's kind of on our opportunity list, but it's not high enough yet for us to have raised it and chatted about it. There's always a possibility though. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Thomas J. Webb - CMS Energy Corp.: You're welcome. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. And as there are no more questions at the present time, I will like to return the call to Ms. Poppe for any closing comments. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Great. Thank you. Thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call. And as I mentioned earlier, Tom, Rejji and I look forward to seeing many of you when we hit the road next week following our board of directors meeting this week here in Jackson. Thanks so much for joining, everybody. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

Jonathan Donnel - Scotia Howard Weil Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CMS Energy 2017 Second Quarter Results and Outlook Call. The earnings new release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 O'clock PM Eastern Time running through August 4. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Srikanth Maddipati - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer, Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Tom Webb, Vice Chairman. This presentation contains forward looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC Filings for more information regarding the risk and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Patti. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you, Sri. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call. It's great to be with you this morning. I'll be sharing our first half results and then operational update. And then Rejji will give the details of our first half financial performance and our outlook. Our stance for people, planet and profit will be reflected in our presentation today. And frankly, it's what we work on every day. Our ability to commit to all three is enabled by our performance which we're continuously improving to the CE Way. I look forward to sharing our latest updates and not to worry, I've got a great story of the month for you. We are happy to report, in spite of record breaking storms in our service territory and mild weather in the first half of the year, we're up 7% on a weather-normalized basis. And perhaps more importantly, we're ahead of our plan by $0.04 year-to-date. And therefore, we are reaffirming our year-end adjusted EPS guidance of 6% to 8% or $2.14 to $2.18. As you've come to expect, our delivery of profits takes the form of a consistent 7% growth over the past 14 years, no matter the conditions we face. Because we're confident about that continued consistent performance, we continue to reaffirm a range of 6% to 8% EPS growth for this year and many years to come. In tough external conditions, consistent top-end financial performance only comes through extraordinary efforts of extraordinary people, one of the cornerstones of our triple bottom line. Now, we've been best-in-class in employee engagement for several years but we must confess we were thrilled to be named the number one employer in Michigan in the annual Forbes best large employer survey in May. And it's no coincidence that the customers served by this engaged team have named us a Most Trusted Brand through a survey conducted by Market Strategies International. As a result of the Energy Law passing in December, our regulatory calendar is full and active. We recognize and appreciate our MPSC staff and commissioners for all their hard work. The Energy Law implementation is going well and it's on track. The MPSC Chairman, Sally Talberg, has done a great job of organizing the working groups and leading a very systematic process to implement this high value legislation. The state reliability mechanism is being evaluated and designed as we speak. It's scheduled for a final determination in December with a June 2018 implementation. Our energy efficiency team is ramping up the new 1.5% electric and 1% gas energy efficiency targets, enabling the new incentive mechanism to go into place. And simultaneously, we have a gas rate case that's scheduled for a final order this coming Monday and our electric rate case will be self implemented in October. Finally, our Palisades early terminations securitization is scheduled for a final order at the end of September. Though this proceeding has no impact on our earnings and it is not baked into our plans, we do believe that this early termination is in the best interest of Michigan. We don't have too many opportunities to save our customer's $45 million a year, so we would love to pass this along to them. We also believe that the early termination of this out-of-market PPA enables the Governor's energy agenda through the elimination of energy waste and improving energy affordability in Michigan, while not jeopardizing the liability as a result of our replacement plan, which serves both people and the planet. Our promise to improve the planet is coming to fruition at a rapid rate. The closure of our seven coal plants in 2016 moved us from 49% coal generation to 22%, more coal retired than any other investor-owned utility in the nation. Our actions resulted in a reduction in carbon intensity of 30% and ranking us as the number one U.S. utility by Sustainalytics, and we aren't finished. Our clean and lean strategy enables further coal reductions without big bets to achieve the replacement. Fulfilling the RPS standard and providing for large business customer preferences for renewables creates the perfect conditions to modernize our generation fleet in a cost efficient, low-risk way. Now when we talk about our commitment to the planet, we're talking about reducing our environmental impact including reductions in water, land use, emissions and carbon. We've self-imposed improvement targets that go beyond environmental compliance and we're ahead of our plan in all of these areas. There was a time when this would have implied higher costs for customers, but not at CMS. We find a way to deliver the and in clean and lean. Lean has many descriptors and attributes. One of which is the concept of waste and waste elimination. An example of waste in our business is the under utilization of assets. Traditionally, generation planners forecast low growth, build a plant big enough to serve that growth and add additional spending reserve. We see modular additions of renewables as a more flexible way to provide adequate supply resources with smaller bets and less potential waste. Modular renewables are a great choice for us because we have ample capital opportunities outside of generation. We have more upgrades than our customers can afford across the entire business. So we're always making choices that maximize customer benefits, while at the same time reducing costs so we can deliver more customer value for every dollar invested. Our customers will benefit from investments in our backlog of upgrades on our grid and on our gas system, and our investors can rely on a sustainable growth strategy. In addition to our own vision for clean and lean generation fleet, the new Michigan Energy Law requires and our customers are asking for more renewable energy. We're expanding our Cross Winds II wind park to grow toward our 15% RPS standard. We conducted an RFP and we were the most competitively priced bidder, therefore, we're building that expansion ourselves. In addition, to our renewable expansions, we worked closely with some of our largest and most energy conscious customers to develop a pricing package that both meets their desired price points and their commitment to the planet. We recently requested approval of this pricing option with the MPSC. This pricing design can enable real attraction to our service territory and serve as an important part of our economic development strategy to grow Michigan. Our residential customers don't want to be left out of the mix. To serve them, we've launched our Solar Gardens, a utility scale community solar program and a pilot to operate rooftop solar package for residential and small commercial customers. These are clean alternatives delivered with a lean mindset. Our lean mindset carries over to all of our investments. For example, the deployment of our smart meter technology has improved our meter reading accuracy and rate, but we did not just rely on technology deployment. We simultaneously improved the work process through applying our CE Way skills. In fact, the remaining meters to be read for our gas-only customers and customers that have opted out of smart meters can be very inefficient to read, but for our meter reading team's improvement efforts. And the results are frankly stunning. We've improved the read rate to 99% and improved reads per hour by 45% year-over-year which contributed to ancillary benefits such as 64% reduction in invoice reworked and a reduction of 2 million calls to our call center. The net impact, over $8 million of savings since 2015, while at the same time, improving the customer experience, do more accurate billing and virtually eliminating estimated meter reads. We use these cost savings to offset the capital investment in infrastructure, which delivers the value our customers deserve and helps keep rates affordable. This is a great example of our business model put into action and it's not even my story of the month. My story of the month is about a fueling pilot in our Flint service center. We have a vision of blue and white pulling out of our 43 service centers all across Michigan every morning after a quick safety briefing and a daily huddle, ready to serve. One thing that slows down our crews today is the time they spend gathering materials, equipment, fueling their vehicles, but this is changing. We've started a pilot in Flint where lower cost night shift has been established to pre-fuel the vehicles and have them prepped and ready to go before the crews arrive in the morning. In Flint alone, this is saving 15 to 30 minutes per person daily. When we extrapolate this to a statewide implementation, the savings potential grows to an elimination of over 100,000 hours of wasted time per year. We can replace those wasted hours with time for our crews to do the value adding work that our customers need. I'm reminded every time we are implementing one of these seemingly simple improvements that we're just scratching the surface of our full potential. You can definitely put this story in the low hanging fruit category. It's what gives us the confidence that we have lots more cost savings opportunities that deliver a better customer experience. Our commitment to the triple bottom line powered by performance and the CE Way is why we are so sure that we can continue to improve the experience for our customers and sustain the performance you've come to expect. This model's been working for more than a decade. And in spite of many changes that are outside of our control, come what may, the CMS team will deliver for our customers and our investors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you, Patti, and good morning everyone. As we have highlighted in the past, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company. We view the investment community as a key element of the people aspect of the triple bottom line, alongside customer's employees and everyone we serve. Our second quarter results of $0.33 per share, down $0.12 from last year, largely due to continued mild weather and record storm activity in our service territory. Put the level of storms into context, year-to-date, we've had five official major event days in 2017, compared to three for all of 2016 which led to approximately $31 million in service restoration costs through the second quarter which is more than $10 million above our five year average at this time of the year, and roughly double the amount spent in the first half of 2016. With that in mind, we don't make excuses, and already have taken steps to mitigate the unfavorable weather impacts. For the first half of the year, adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share were flat from last year and up $0.08 or 7% on a weather-normalized basis, which positions us well to meet our annual financial objectives. As Patti mentioned, we're quite pleased with our performance to-date and remain $0.04 ahead of plan, even with the unfavorable weather and record storm activity in the first half of the year. As indicated in the waterfall chart, we have managed to offset $0.11 of mild weather and record storms fully in the first half of the year with cost savings, out performance at enterprises and rate relief net of investments among other factors. Our business model which focuses on achieving cost savings coupled with modest sales and other countermeasures to minimize customer rate inflation has enabled us to end the first half of 2017 ahead of plan which bodes well for the remainder of the year. For the second half of 2017 we have assumed $0.07 of additional rate relief net of investments, and as always we're implementing numerous cost control measures. Lastly, we will also benefit from the absence of discretionary activities which occurred in the second half of 2016, such as our debt pre-funding and relatively high volume of donations, some of which equates to $0.14 of potential EPS pickup in the back half this year. In summary, we believe these factors provide us with significant flexibility for the rest of the year. As such, we remain highly confident in our ability to deliver 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth in 2017. I know you all are well acquainted with this EPS forecast curve which illustrates our progress on meeting our targets or meeting our earnings targets as we move through the year. This year, we started out with mild weather and significant storm activity, but took actions to remain ahead of plan in the first half of the year. This chart also overlays the curve from 2016. As highlighted, we enjoyed favorable weather and great cost performance in the second half of 2016 which permitted substantial reinvestment back into business in the fourth quarter. This, as you can imagine, makes the comparison a bit easier for 2017. So we're right on course for another solid, predictable year in 2017. EPS curves for the past decade remind us that every year is different, but the results were the same. We delivered consistent industry leading EPS growth by managing the business on behalf of customers and investors. During periods of better than expected weather and cost performance, we have reinvested in the business as evidenced by the $340 million in aggregate that we've put to work over the past four years to achieve customer improvements. Conversely, during periods of unfavorable weather or other unexpected negative variances, we've made up the difference through cost savings and good business decisions without compromising our commitments to our customers and employees. Irrespective of the circumstances, we have managed to deliver within our earnings guidance annually and this year will be no different. Having spent a good deal of the past three months with the investment community, many have asked how CMS has achieved and will continue to achieve consistent industry leading earnings growth without raising customer rates above inflation year-in and year- out. Admittedly even I asked this question when I was on the outside looking in. Well the answer is that we have a robust capital plan of needed customer investments largely funded by annual cost savings of 2% to 3% a year, modest utility sales growth and other enhancements such as thoughtful tax planning which eliminates the need for dilutive block equity issuance worth about 2%. All of this equates to a self-funding roughly 70% of our capital plan which minimizes customer rate impacts to level at or below inflation, while our growth continues at 6% to 8%. This simple, but unique business model has driven our historical success and offers a sustainable path forward to benefit our customers, investors. Our customer driven capital plan is comprised of needed investments, which will enable the delivery of safe, reliable and efficient electricity and natural gas to those we serve. We've forecast a base case of approximately $18 billion capital investments over the next 10 years in alignment with our clean and lean strategy, which Patti highlighted earlier. As we've noted in the past, we anticipate additional opportunities of approximately $7 billion in the form of enhanced gas infrastructure, grid monetization and cost efficient PPA replacement through renewables and other sources. As always affordability from a customer and balance sheet perspective, commission alignment and execution capabilities will dictate the pace at which we take on such opportunities. As to the latter point around execution risk, this slide illustrates our confidence in our ability to execute on our 10-year plan. As highlighted, over 90% of our 10-year capital plan of $18 million is represented by projects less than $200 million in size which compares favorably to our capital plan composition over the past 10 years. Broadly speaking, project size offers directional guidance as to the complexity and duration of projects. As such, our capital plan is not only increasing in size but is decreasing in terms of risk profile which bodes well for customers and investors. Our capital plan embodies the modular nature of the clean and lean strategy and perpetuates our no big bets investment velocity. A key driver of our ability to execute on our capital plan in an affordable manner is made possible by lean thinking and performance which drives sustainable cost savings. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, CMS has been a leader in this area and our employees have embraced CE Way to continue to come up with new and innovative ways to deliver those savings to our customers. For investors, this creates capital investment headroom and fulfills our self-imposed commitment to keep base rate increases at or below inflation. Over the last decade, we have been able to reduce our O&M costs by more than 3% per year and the past three years have been no exception. We're projecting conservatively to continue at this pace at about 2% over the next three years, without compromising our commitments to customers in the form of service upgrades, and while keeping employee salaries and benefits competitive, two key constituents and the people element of the triple bottom line. Our capital investment strategy in support of regulatory outcomes coupled with annual cost savings and tax planning have enabled us to grow operating cash flow by about $100 million annually. In fact, we've increased our operating cash flow by $1.8 billion in aggregate since 2004. Our past and prospective cash flow generation has and will continue to eliminate the need for dilutive block equity issuance going forward which further supports the self-funding strategy. For reference, as of June 30, 2017 we've generated over $1.1 billion of operating cash flow which is slightly ahead of plan and the corresponding period in 2016. Switching gears to sales, the economic outlook for service territory, particularly in Grand Rapids, the largest city in our service territory and in the heart of our footprint remains relatively strong as indicated on this slide. As stated in the past, we don't rely heavily on sales growth as evidenced by our forecast of 0.5% to 1% for 2017 while we continue to be encouraged by the increased expansion and diversification of our service territory. We continue to work closely with the governor's office, the legislative branch and the key regulators to bring business to Michigan because we win when Michigan wins. Moving onto enterprises, DIG continues to drive the performance of this business unit. Enterprises was ahead of both the plan and the corresponding period in 2016 due to operational efficiencies attributable to upgrades completed in 2015 and higher capacity prices. As you'll note on the bottom of the slide, capacity remains open in the future years to take further advantage of attractive pricing. As Patti noted, we'll have more visibility on the Palisades result by the end of September which will dictate our longer term plans for DIG. And as stated in the past, we remain cautiously optimistic as to the outcome of the Palisades' proceeding but have not factored that pending decision into our plans. As we approach the back half of 2017, we continue to evaluate potential risks and corresponding mitigating factors to minimize volatility in our plan as evidenced by our sensitivities slide. A noteworthy opportunity includes energy efficiency incentives, which were doubled under a new Energy Law but we have only accounted for half of the increase in our financial planning with another $0.02 of potential upside yet to be reflected. In closing, the last slide provides a reminder of our financial objectives for 2017, all of which are well on track. Needless to say, we remain acutely focused on delivering another year of consistent industry-leading growth with minimal rate impacts to the benefit of customers, investors. At this point, Brandon, please open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you very much Mr. Hayes. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Our first question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, good morning. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Michael. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about the RFP or the process that's ongoing at the Commission for securitization to improve securitization of the payment to Entergy as well like, what timing do you see on that. And then also, what kind of timing do you see on getting a replacement for Palisades that you did dig (22:27) into? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Right. So just a couple of high level dates. So first of all, we expect the order from the Commission on the securitization at the end of September. And keep in mind that's just approving the financing mechanism for the payment to Entergy of $172 million. And then after that we'll be \u2013 and they may provide some color in that order about the replacement plan but the replacement plan really is filled out in a forward-looking rate case that we'll be filing later. So it is definitely a process. Now they may give some clear indications that say they want us to sign a contract or they give indications they would want us to bring DIG for example into the utility, but none of that would be necessary. We don't expect that to be binding. We expect the really just the order to be about the securitization and then forward cases about the backfill plan. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right. Hey, Rejji, you made an interesting comment, you said that as an outsider looking in you were skeptical of how CMS could achieve growth you know without that large cost increases on rates. And I'm just wondering if what have you learned since you've gotten there that has surprised you. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Well, first I would say skeptical as a paraphrase that was not a quote, but I would say I've been pleasantly surprised on the inside now at how well the company has managed to not only execute on its capital plan, which as you know is quite robust as well as risk mitigated, but also to realize significant savings year in and year out. And so you're familiar with that slide where we show our benchmarking relative to sector and that's a real achievement of O&M cost reductions of 3% per year over the last 10 years. And if you look at the next three years going forward we think that there are significant opportunities to realize additional O&M cost reductions. We've talked about this in the past, but you know candidly, I would submit that a lot of the cost savings we've realized in the past are really through sheer will and just a lot of good discipline. But through the CE Way we think we can offer much greater level sophistication in realizing cost savings in a scalable and replicable way. And so we think a combination of process-oriented related savings as well as technology-enabled savings through smart meters and other measures should continue to lead us down this path of consistent cost reduction in the years to come. So I've seen a lot of opportunities within these walls. And if you look at some of the other metrics that Patti highlights in our stories of the month, there's a lot of low hanging fruit here. And so that's what encouraged to me that this path we've been on for so long is sustainable in the long run. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: One last question on the \u2013 you said that there was a filing at the Commission to approve your packaged renewable offering, right, to customers that's going to be competitive. Can you just talk a little bit more about that? What kind of an approval you're looking for and when that might come? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, so it's a tariff and they do have to approve that tariff and there's a range of time. In the next couple of months, we expect to hear the results of that tariff approval. So, what we like about it and what we think is particularly unique is that it does not have a cross cost shift. It really provides the access for our large business customers to have access to renewable energy. They remain a full bundled customer, but then they're able \u2013 they have a couple of options they can either bring their own PPA, which we're agnostic to or we will provide the renewables for them and they can then sell that on in MISO. And if prices go up then they get the upside because we've signed a fixed contract with them so that's very appealing to them. What's appealing to us is they remain full bundled customers and we're able to provide the energy in the form that they prefer. So what we've heard from our large business customers is I mean a direct quote from one of them was this is the first time a utility has figured this out. This is exactly what we need and it makes Michigan very attractive. So we're optimistic that the Commission will approve the tariff especially since it doesn't have any kind of cost shift to others. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Is that something you expect to happen in the next month or two or is this kind of a rough... Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. In next 90 days we expect an outcome. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning guys. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Jonathan. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Quick \u2013 so I was just looking at your 2017 first half to full year bridge slide, I think slide 13 and you're showing first half cost savings of $0.04 through the first half but it was $0.08 through the first quarter? And just kind of judging by how you tend to manage the business, I would have thought that you would have been pushing for more cost savings outside of storm, given the storm experience you were having during the quarter. So just curious why we've seen the cost saving number reverse in the second quarter. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, I wouldn't say it's necessarily a reverse, Jonathan. This is just the math. If you're specifically referencing on slide 13 or slide 14 this bucket we have here of what bridges the gap, if you take into account the rates and investment or the rate net of investments and then the $0.12 to $0.16 with six months to go. Well, the reason why we feel confident in our ability to close this gap is that we have all of these activities that we've put in place which are really discretionary in the second half of 2016, which we don't need to replicate in this year, as we think about closing this gap. And so the only specificity we have is, as it pertains to the cost savings as other is just this math here that closes the gap between the discretionary items that we won't have to replicate again in 2017 and then there's cost savings in other line item, that gets you the $0.12 to $0.16. But we believe that we can realize cost savings beyond that. So just to be clear that number is effectively just a plug here for illustrative purposes, but we believe we can realize more cost savings over the course of the second half of the year. We're already seeing that in the form of customer operations billing. Patti highlighted a lot of good achievement (28:54). And we think there are much more cost things beyond what's just on this page. So again the math here is more for illustrative purposes that just closes the gap on the $0.12 to $0.16, but we think there's a lot more opportunities on that going forward. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: But the fact you are $0.08 a head of savings plan or you were getting $0.08 benefit from cost in the quarter it is only $0.04 in the first half, can we just kind of dig into that a little? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: So in the first half we had improvement in benefits of about $0.04 and that was largely due to an accelerated pensions funding that we did in the fourth quarter of last year. So that helped us out by $0.04. And then we had some other good news on property tax related to our Zeeland plant in the first quarter of the year. So that drove a lot of the performance. But as we go into the second half, again, we have additional cost savings that we have factored in the plan, again, that should help us get through to the second quarter through to the second half of the year, and get us to our guidance of $2.14 to $2.18. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: So again \u2013 sorry. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, sorry. Okay. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: I guess, I would just add Jonathan too, remember we don't work to the quarter we work to a year end number. And we're \u2013 as you know our little S-curve that's on slide 16 shows that every year is a little different and the comparison sometimes from one quarter and one year to the quarter before. It's not necessarily reflective of the year in confidence which is what we're trying to express with our re-affirmation of our year-end guidance. We feel real good about the full year performance. That's what we're working to. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, Rejji, you did allude to the fact you feel that this cost savings number for the second half is kind of a (30:37) things that you just have coming to you anyway. So you did have continued storm and/or unfavorable weather. Can you give us some sense of how much you think you could flex the business if you get further headwind? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. So we're already anticipating if you look again on slide 13, if we have a weather-normalized second half of the year that will cost us $0.07 because we obviously had a very nice second half of the year in 2016. And we think rates net of investments, again, that's comprised of our electric self-implementation and then where we end up on gas, the gas rate case in this upcoming Monday and so that should offset the weather. And then as you look at the latter portion of this year, we think that a combination of cost savings and again discretionary activities that we executed in the second half of last year, because we had a very good summer and had the opportunity to reinvest back in the business. We don't have to replicate such activities going forward. So we think a combination of those, or the lack of those activities, or the absence of those activities coupled with uncollectible account (31:43) and we also have some items that we've forecasted rather conservatively at the parent level that we could potentially defer going into 2018. The combination of all those items should get us through to next year. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Through our guidance for this year. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Could I just ask one other thing? I noticed on the cash flow side, the NOLs and credit line now has $700 million in 2020 and 2021 where it was only 200 last quarter. Seems that has been a change at the back end there. Is there anything to explain that? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yep. So there are couple of changes that have come about reflected in our NOL and credit, so you're referring to that bottom yellow row on slide 20. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, yes. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Sorry. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. It dropped off pretty much, much faster before. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. So what we're seeing there is obviously, we have to plan to invest about $1 billion or so to get to our RPS standard of 15% as stipulated by the Energy Law. And so, obviously, by increasing our estimates for capital expenditures related to renewables that does help the balance of NOLs and credit we have forecasted for the next four or five years. And, again, as we sit here today, we don't expect to be a federal tax payer all the way through 2020. And so we only start paying a portion of federal taxes come 2021. So a lot of it has to do with basically pulling forward spending to meet the new RPS standard. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Does effectively could help to defray equity a little further? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Precisely. And so, again, we do not anticipate through our five-year plan issuing dilutive block equity in the next five years or even beyond that potentially. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for all the help. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morning. First question, you know I noticed that in the second quarter the weather-normalized electric sales actually decline. They were down 0.4%. Does that still keep you on track for the plus 0.5% to 1% you're budgeting for the year, anything particularly that caused that decline? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. It's a good question, Ali. We have said for some time now that we foresee weather-adjusted electric sales of 0.5% to 1%. And as you may recall in Q4, on the Q4 earnings call and also in the Q1 earnings call, we historically had attributed that to strong performance in the industrial side. And we have very good visibility on the performance of that segment as you probably saw that has been tailing off quite a bit. But what encourages us and the reason why we still feel good about that 0.5% to 1% percent forecast is we are seeing a wonderful trend in terms of sales mix. And so our residential performance has been well in excess of our expectations, and so we're about 0.5% up for residential on the electric side on a weather-adjusted basis, and almost 2% up for commercial. And so we're seeing a nice bit of favorable sales mix, which gives us confidence in that 0.5% to 1%. And what I would also say just peeling the onion a bit on industrial, the downward trend you see for industrial, that's largely attributable to our retail open access customers and then one large customer who has had lower than expected performance. And so there is a lower margin customers and our remaining balance of industrial customers have performed quite well. And so we feel very good about the 0.5% to 1% weather-adjusted sales forecast. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then secondly, more conceptually, when you talk about the ability to keep customer rates at or below inflation, one of the categories that you put in that is the no-block equity requirement. So I mean intuitively, you know, the equity whether you want to issue or not shouldn't have a direct impact on customer base, but to interpret that, is that saying to get to the 6% to 8% growth rate to solve for that equation, the fact that you don't need equity helps you in keeping customers rates down, is that the way to interpret that? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: That's exactly right because, obviously, if you issue a significant portion of equity, it's going to be dilutive on your earnings. And so we take pride in the fact that we have enough capability on the cost cutting side to fund a good portion of that capital investment backlog execution, the $18 billion plan. We've been realizing cost cuts to say 2% to 3% over the last 10 years and are forecasting that going forward. And so that coupled with the very good tax planning that has allowed us to not pay federal taxes for the last several years and for the next four or five years forward. Coupled with a little bit of sales performance at the utility has enabled us to avoid doing those real dilutive block equity deals which others may need to do and that obviously keeps our EPS right where we'd like it to be at that healthy 6% to 8% adjusted growth level. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. And then as you mentioned the gas rate case decision should be coming out next week. Currently there is a slight variance between your last authorized electric ROE and gas. For planning purposes, do you assume that they would align and that 20 basis point reduction that you're seeing in electric that gas probably gets to the same level? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: So, just to align on the facts, so we requested to be clear a 10.6% ROE for the gas rate case, obviously, as a result of the self-implementation order as well as what we're seeing in terms of some of the other data points (37:25) expectations have been tempered. And so we have assumed a double-digit ROE to be sure. And you know there may be a chance that we get to at levels either obtained by DTE in recent cases or closer to electric. And so we'll see where we end up, but it's I think a little early to speculate as to where we may end up on the gas rate case. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Patti. Good morning, Rejji. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just a clarification. Are you $0.04 ahead of plan on a weather adjusted basis or absolute? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Absolute. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. And then, Rejji, you mentioned that you've got $0.02 in your hip pocket around energy efficiency. How challenging is that to execute? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, I'd say if you look at our track record over the last couple of years, we have been quite good at realizing the required reductions on electric and gas and so. In the prior energy law, you needed to get basically a 1 gigawatt hour reduction on the electric side and 0.75 billion cubic feet reduction in gas and that is now changes for the new Energy Law to 1.5% and 1% for electric and gas respectively. And then you get now 20% of the cost to achieve those savings. And so we feel good about our ability to execute on that. What remains to be seen is how much of that upside we can realize in this year because as you may know, the new Energy Law came into effect in April of this year and so there's only a question about whether that should be prorated earnings or should it be the full year. If it's full year, it could be worth $0.02. If it's prorated portion, it could be a $0.01. And so that's the only concern we have at this point. But we, looking at our historical track record, are highly confident we can execute on realizing those customer savings and then realizing the benefits associated there with. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: And we'll get clarity on that by September 30 in a final order from the Commission. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Is the test based on a cumulative amount or a run rate at a certain kind of a snapshot date? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: It's a cumulative amount. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Good morning. Thank you. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Morning. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Morning Travis. Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hey you answered most of my questions. But I have one longer strategic one. At what point do you look for landmarks for that extra $7 billion of CapEx? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: So the key signpost that we would look for as we execute on our capital plan and potentially realize those upside opportunities and just to be clear what's in that. So to go from $18 billion to $25 billion, you really have a few pieces in there. You've got gas infrastructure, which is just north of about $2.25 billion. And then you've got just under $750 million attributable to grid modernization and then potential Palisades replacement and the balance is really a potential replacement option for the MCV contract which expires in 2025 and that's about call it $3.5 billion or thereabouts if you include potential wind replacement coupled with gas peaker plant support. And so as we think about what may allow us to pull those levers, it really is the historical constraints and that's customer affordability and/or the need to fund that an efficient way on our balance sheet. And so the signposts we'd need to see is how economic does wind become over time. What cost savings are we able to realize to self-fund the business and again permit us to fund or execute on the capital plan of that magnitude? And, again, if the economics associated with renewables or other potential alternative means to replace that MCV PPA come into effect. So it's a combination of I'd say affordability and balance sheet capacity in order to take that on. Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. And with that the Palisades replacement portion of it, is there any kind of indication that that might be out of the capital plan after the regulatory proceedings? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: As Patti highlighted, we should have visibility by the end of September as to where we'll come out on Palisades. And then with respect to whether DIG or some other entity becomes being part of the longer term plan, we won't have visibility on that until we a file rate case in the subsequent year. And then there's a bit of process that would need to take place. We'd need to get approval from the Commission for whatever purchase plan we have on the gas side. Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay great. Appreciate it. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Travis. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please go ahead. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Just maybe it's a little too early but following up on a question around the Palisades replacement and DIG. Is that something that you would like to do or that's still a bucket of options that you're looking at? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: I would call it in your words the bucket of options. You know the one thing that we want to make sure that we're doing is reducing and passing along the reduced cost to our customers and we think that's most important. And you know, on one hand just on the question of DIG inside the utility or outside the utility we think it's a win either way. When it's outside of the utility, it's available to provide bilateral contracts and we think there's potential in that market. If it's inside the utility, we think it can add value to utility customers. And so we feel very comfortable working through the alternatives and making sure that both the Commission and we are aligned and satisfied that we've got the resource adequacy for the State of Michigan, the visibility that we need for that resource adequacy and most importantly that we're able to pass along the savings as a result of the early termination of out-of-market PPA. So we really are at the end of the day just going to look for the lowest cost method to backfill that PPA. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yep. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Donnel with Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Jonathan Donnel - Scotia Howard Weil : Good morning. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Jon. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning. Jonathan Donnel - Scotia Howard Weil : Hey. Just a couple more details on the waterfall slide there kind of bridging the last six months of the year. In terms of the rates and investment piece of the $0.07, are you assuming anything for the gas rates beyond what you've self-implemented today or just sticking with the $20 million? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: As you know, historically, we've been very conservative around our accounting and expectations and so we've self-implemented $20 million and so that's where we're at. Jonathan Donnel - Scotia Howard Weil : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, similarly for the Foundation spending, I think that was higher than normal in 2016. Is the $0.05 delta that's kind of baked in here, does that assume any payments made in 2017 or is there still just kind of a normal year expectation on what you would spend on that? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. In our financial planning, we always presuppose that we'll make donations to the Foundation, but it's always a function of how well the business performs over the course of the first few quarters of the year. And so we'll see where we're at by the fourth quarter and if we continue to trend well economically, we'd love to take advantage of those opportunities to put more money in the Foundation. Obviously, last year, the second half was quite good and so we really stepped up on the donations, not just the foundation, but for other opportunities of interest. And as I've said before, if we see a soft or mild summer and we don't have those sorts of opportunities this year, we can clearly pull back on that sort of activity to meet our earnings guidance of $2.14 to $2.18. Jonathan Donnel - Scotia Howard Weil : So there could be some more room besides just the $0.05 that's baked on that side, theoretically? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Potentially, but that said, we're still focused on $2.14 to $2.18 and 6% to 8% growth. Jonathan Donnel - Scotia Howard Weil : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Jon. Operator : This concludes our questions. So I would like to turn it back over to Ms. Poppe for any closing remarks. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you, Brandon. And thanks again for all of you for joining us this morning. I'll just reiterate that we feel good about our performance in the first half in spite of the headwinds. While we are ahead of our plan and it's why we're reiterating our year end guidance of 6% to 8% EPS growth, as you know you can count on us to deliver. And we definitely hope to see you September 25 at our Investor Day in New York. Thanks, Brandon. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation. Now release your lines.",

Analysts: Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Ali Agha - SunTrust Travis Miller - Morningstar Andrew Levi - Avon Capital Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CMS Energy 2017 Third Quarter Results and Outlook Call. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.[Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at 12 :00 pm Eastern time, running through November 2. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Sri Maddipati : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I will turn the call over to Patti. Patti Poppe : Thank you, Sri. Good morning, everyone. We are happy to have you with us. I know that we saw many of your at our Investor Day on September 25th and we'll see many of you at EEI, so I'll be brief this morning. But we do have a few updates to share, including our results for the quarter, and not to worry, we have another exciting story of the month. Rejji will walk you through the financial results and our outlook. We're happy to announce that for the first nine months of 2017 we reported $1.66 of adjusted EPS. On a weather normalized basis, this is up 8% from last year. Despite challenging weather and storms through the year, we are well on track to meet our guidance, and we're raising our bottom end of our top -- of our full year guidance from $2.14 to $2.15 per share. Our top end remains unchanged at $2.18 per share. We're also introducing 2018 full year guidance of $2.29 to $2.33 per share, which implies another year of 6% to 8% annual growth. Now this is a good opportunity for me to remind you what we mean when we say 6% to 8%. For 14 years in a row, we have delivered 7%, so it would be easy to assume that we when moved from 5% to 7% to 6% to 8% we meant to imply 8%. What we actually signalled is our confidence in 7%, and frankly, we took 5% off the table. Our self funding model and our adaptability under a variety of changing conditions each year puts us in a unique position to deliver sustainable 6% to 8% annual growth. This is why we have confidence in the midpoint of our range. In years where we have particularly strong performance and don't have higher priorities for reinvestment, we could go to the high end. However, our bias is to reinvest in the business and to stack the deck for next year and deliver our growth trajectory for longer. We know it is both our growth rate and the consistency of it that is valued. To that end, we remain unwavering in our commitment to the triple bottom line. Our focus on people, planet and profit underpinned by our performance will deliver the consistent and sustainable results that you have come to expect. When we say people, we are referring to our customers, our co-workers, our communities, and of course, our investors. Driving economic development in Michigan is a great way to enable growth and to serve the people of Michigan. We know that when Michigan wins, our business wins. It's a competitive environment and these large site selection efforts and Michigan is winning. In part, due to the speed of our in-house economic development team which has identified 23 energy ready sites so that when a company wants to locate here we can quickly help them find a site that's available and best suited to their needs. For example, we were pleased that when Lear Corporation, a large auto supplier was looking for a place to locate a new manufacturing facility, we were ready. As a result, Lear recently announced plans to invest in a new plant in Flint, a community we are proud to serve. This is another win for Michigan creating approximately 450 new jobs. Turning to the planet, we're thrilled with the response to our renewable tariff. This program allows us to partner with our large business customers to meet their commitment to renewable energy at a very competitive price. We're already looking for ways to expand this program to keep up with our customers demand and partner with them to protect the planet. Finally, our commitment to people and the planet can't be fulfilled without the critical capital that you have all provided. We know that pensioners, retirees and moms and pops have entrusted you with their life savings to invest in safe and reliable places. We want you to count on us to be just that sort of place. Therefore, we are equally committed to delivering consistent and predictable financial results. We continue to progress on the regulatory agenda and look for ways to support longer-term planning. The 2016 energy law creates a framework for the governor's long-term energy plan and our commission has been systematically implementing the different elements of it. For example, we'll be filing our integrated resource plan required by the new law next year. Combined with the commissions ordered 5-year electric distribution plan, we'll be providing a vivid picture of the future replacements, upgrades and enhancements to our large and aging electric supply and distribution system in partnership with the commission and its staff, yielding more transparency and regulatory certainty going forward. Our rate cases remain on track. Our gas rate case was approved at $29 million and it included and expanded $18 million capital tracking mechanism. We plan to file our upcoming gas case in the next couple of weeks. Our new electric rates were self implemented at $130 million on October 1st. We expect a final order in March of 2018. These rate cases enable the infrastructure improvement that deliver real value to our customers and reflect the cost savings that help reduce the price of that infrastructure. One way we are driving our ongoing cost savings is through the implementation of the Consumers Energy Way, our lean operating system. Most of the coverage about the Consumers Energy Way has been about the benefits of those cost savings. My story for this month however, demonstrates the power of the CE Way to not only reduce cost through waste elimination but also to enable better system performance and areas like electric reliability to the benefit of our customers. You know we've been in business for 130 years, and yet, we still find things we can improve every single day. About a year ago, we realized that our approach to improving reliability was just not working as fast as we wanted, so we stepped back and leveraging our CE Way playbook, we tackled the systemic issue in a whole new way. The result speaks for themselves. In spite of challenging weather and storm activity, we had our best system reliability ever recorded this quarter. Our talented team tackled the problem through the use of data and applied problem solving techniques, and as a result, we improved the prioritization of capital investments on our worst-performing circuits, we actually call those our Dirty Thirty. We had more targeted tree trimming and we realized that we could effectively engineer animal mitigation at our substations. Yes, the CE Way even helps us protect our local critters. This coordinated effort resulted in a 40% improvement in reliability for this quarter versus our last 10 year average. Every dollar we spend is more effective. The waste is eliminated, and our customers have a better experience. I am sure this sounds simplistic, but when we apply the CE Way every day all across our system in big and small ways, we fuel our simple but powerful business model, higher value at lower cost built on our consistent past and yields a sustainable future that you and your clients can count on. Now I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Patti, and good morning everyone. We know how busy, this time of the year is for the investment community, and as such, we greatly appreciate your interest in our company. As posted earlier this morning, we reported $0.61 earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the third quarter and $0.62 per share on an adjusted basis. Our third quarter results are down $0.08 from last year, largely due to continued mild weather, however, on a weather-normalized basis, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 7% year-over-year. Year-to-date, we reported per-share earnings per share of $1.65 on a GAAP basis and $1.66 on an adjusted basis, which is down $0.07 from the prior year due to mild weather and significant storm activity, but up 8% year-over-year on a weather-normalized basis. We remain quite pleased with our performance to-date, which is $0.16 per share, ahead of plan, largely due to favorable sales mix and strong cost performance. We're well on track to meet our annual financial objectives, and as a result, as Patti highlighted, we decided to raise the low end of our 2017 EPS guidance range so our revised range is now $2.15 to $2.18 per share. As you can see on the waterfall chart on Slide eight, weather and storms have negatively impacted our year-to-date results by $0.24 per share. As noted, we have largely offset those impacts through strong cost performance and favorable sales mix, coupled with rate relief and our performance at enterprises which positions us well for the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, you'll note that the regulatory outcomes achieved this year, including the aforementioned electric rate case self implementation of $130 million provided $0.08 of pickup relative to last year, which gets us over a third of the way home. As we've discussed in the past, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we took on a number of discretionary reinvestment activities which equated to $0.14 per share on aggregate that we do not need to replicate this year. But some of those two factors alone put us within the implied range for required EPS outperformance versus Q4 of 2016 to meet our revised 2017 EPS guidance range. Consequently, we have a great deal of optionality in the final months of the year to manage weather uncertainty and/or to reinvestment business to support our future financial and operational objectives. Our 2017 EPS outlook curve on Slide nine embodies our efforts to date, and the goods financial flexibility that we have going into the fourth quarter. As you'll note, weather and storms have hurt us in every quarter this year. And every quarter, we've responded with sound operational and financial planning to stay on course to meet our financial objectives while delivering world-class customer experience. As mentioned, favorable sales mix has been helpful to date, and we have supplemented that with strong cost performance, including lower than planned financing cost, higher energy efficiency incentives and strong property and income tax planned. As always, every year offers varying levels of uncertainty such as weather and storm activity, but we have always managed to work and driven cost savings to position ourselves well to deliver another year of consistent financial performance. As Patti noticed -- as Patti noted, our bias is to reinvest in the business, to stack the deck for the next year, and we are cautiously optimistic about our ability to do so again this year. In order to stay on this path over the long term, we remain focused on executing on our capital planet utility going forward while self funding roughly, 70% of that rate-based growth. This approach minimizes customer rate impact and allows us to grow at 6% to 8% annually. This simple, but unique, business model has driven our historical success and offers a sustainable plan to deliver the triple bottom line in the years to come. At our Investor Day, we highlighted the current customer investment plan at $18 billion over 10 years. We also reiterated the incremental $7 billion of customer investment opportunities which is evenly split between infrastructure and supply investments. We have a relatively large and old system and our proposed investments would improve system reliability and safety to the benefit of our customers and investors. We will look to execute on these incremental opportunities overtime, assuming we can continue to identify cost savings opportunities to fund such investments. As we've said in the past, our key constraint is customer affordability and we do not intend to compromise that principal going forward. To that end, in order to fund our robust capital plan, we will continue to [Indiscernible] our cost structure for savings opportunities. We've emphasized O&M as a key component of our cost reduction strategy in the past and we'll continue to do so. But O&M only represents about $1 billion of roughly $5 billion cost structure, so we don't limit our thinking to just O&M. For example, future expirations of above market PPAs will reduce fuel and power supply cost and our clean and lean capital investment philosophy will prioritize modular investments to reduce cost and allow us to adapt to changing load patterns. Through the CE Way, we will identify process improvements and efficiencies to eliminate waste and we'll couple that with good business decisions such as attrition management to reduce future O&M cost and we'll always seek opportunistic, non operating savings on our balance sheet or through good tax planning to supplement our operational efforts as we've done for the past several years. These are just a few examples that would enable us to reduce cost well into the future for our customers and create headroom for future investments. Moving to operating cash flow, we have generated approximately $1.2 billion year-to-date and we feel good about our ability to deliver approximately $1.65 billion for the full year with steady growth thereafter. As a reminder, our cash flow generation coupled with strong tax planning will enable us to fund our capital plan cost efficiently by avoiding black equity issuances. On Slide 14, we show our historical EPS trajectory for the past few years and where we're headed. And it should come as no surprise that our guidance is consistent with the past and reflects our long-term growth aspirations. As we've done the past, we've raised the bottom end of this year's guidance and initiated next year's base in the midpoint. As you know, we grow up our actual results without adjusting for things like weather, or rebasing off a prior midpoint. Needless to say, we've been on the steady climb for more than a decade and we plan to continue to deliver well into the future. In closing, as we look ahead, we see a number of customer investments and cost reduction opportunities that will enable us to continue to deliver the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit underpinned by performance. And with that, we would like to open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you very much Mr. Hayes.[Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning. Congrats on a impressive results given the weather and everything. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Julien. Rejji Hayes : Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. So a quick question, perhaps starting a little bit bigger picture here. You talked about the IRP coming up here, you also have in your slides talk of a kind of a gradual coal evolution in the plan and ops of 21% to 15%. Can you talk about how the IRP might reconcile against the Slide 15 here and what you talked about in terms of future coal capacity in the portfolio? Patti Poppe : Yes, it actually will provide a lot of visibility to that, Julien. We're really excited about having the IRP available to us. It provides a framework and the certainly so as we make those long-term transitions, we are able to have alignment with our commissions and make good decisions together about balancing a variety of factors; fuel diversity, cost for customers, how we want to fulfill the RPS standards, how much energy efficiency and demand response we want, in fact, our IRP, looks like it's going to have 47 different model runs that we're undertaking right now, as we speak. And so it's a complex set of variables and we're excited about what the opportunities will be provided and the transparency and frankly regulatory certainty that will be a result of it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. If I can delve...oh sorry, please go for it Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Julien, this is Rejji. The only thing I would add is, as you look at Slide 15 and that coal capacity from 21% to 15%, one of the underlying assumption is the conversion of the Filer City plant at enterprises. And so we're planning to convert that from coal to natural gas, so basically going from 60 megawatts of coal to about 225 megawatts of natural gas. That is in the regulatory process and it's trending well. So that is one component of the road to get from 21% to 15%. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Can you elaborate a little bit just on what the timing of that transition is as well, and how you think about that. And maybe perhaps, So you can tell what may not necessarily be finalized, what the key variable you all are thinking about in that transition there? Patti Poppe : Yes, I would say, the timing is over this 10 year time horizon that we're looking at, making these transitions. We have -- at 22% coal we're already one of the lowest in the country. We feel good about that. The fuel diversity of having our sites remaining is an important part of the mix. And so, we'll build that into the plan. And frankly, we look forward to the results of the model because they'll be informing to us about when the best time is to utilize those -- or to transition those plants. The reality is, we've done some environmental upgrades at those facilities, so they're best-in-class environmental controls currently. And so to rush any -- any additional retirements probably isn't necessary but they do have a natural end-of-life within that cycle. So we'll be thinking through that the -- through the IRP, and frankly, with all of our critical stakeholders, internal and outside the company. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just a quick one on the numbers here, obviously, you've done very well on cost management and some of the recovery factors on slide 9 there again this year. Since you've launched 2018 guidance, you might you be able to elaborate a little bit on some of the key factors we should we thinking about in the year-over-year comparison in that range? What are perhaps some of the known variables that you might be thinking about or leveraged as we say, in cost management next year? Is there anything that you can kind of say today that we should we paying attention to as we think about that plan? Rejji Hayes : Yes, so we offer a couple of thoughts. And so when we talk about, particularly, O&M cost-reduction opportunities, we've talked in the past about the very nice annuity that we\u2019ve gotten through attrition management over the years. And so that has been something that we've said has been a benefit in the past, and should be an ongoing benefit in the years to come. So specifically on average, we've got about 350 to 400 employees who turn over, who are on defined benefit plans, which obviously are not as cost-effective as defined contribution plans and we froze those plans in their early thoughts. And so now when we have new employees come in, by definition they are on defined contribution plans. We generally save about $40,000 per FTE when we have turnover between defined benefit plan employees and then defined contribution plans employees coming in. And so if you have $40,000 of savings per FTE and you turnover about $400 per year, that generates about $16 million of savings per year. And you think about our cost structure and the O&M side of about $1 billion, that's got about 1.5% savings. And so that gets us a good portion of the way there. Obviously, we always look to do opportunistic refinancings and so we do have some high coupon bonds in our portfolio that we may look to be opportunistic around. And so that introduces opportunities for savings. And clearly, as mentioned before, we are always looking at tax planning opportunities on the property tax or income tax side. So there's a variety of opportunities we look for. And then also as I mentioned, because we're in reinvestment mode for the fourth quarter, this is the time of the year where we look for pull-aheads and if there are operational-related expenses that we have currently forecasted in 2018 that we can pull forward because we're trending well this year, we'll look to do that as well. So that's a small list of the opportunities that we have before us, Julian. Patti Poppe : And Julian, I'll add just a couple more, just to reinforce at there's plenty. We've got -- the CE Way is just taking shape and so we're finding operational savings across the board, around the organization. Our technology adoption, so going from our traditional phone calls to our digital channels is a fundamental cost savings and cost reduction, and so part of what you're hearing from Rejji and I here and for everyone on the phone is that we have the luxury of focus. Our business model is not complex. We don't have big bets, we're not betting on big outcomes. We've got a series of small, focused efforts that allow us to deliver consistently. And the consistency is what we know you've come to expect and we're pretty excited about the breadth and depth of opportunities that are in front of us. Rejji Hayes : Julien, the only other thing I would note and this is not related to the cost savings but it is worth noting that for the first 9 months of the year, storms have hurt us to the tune of -- sorry, weather and storms have hurt us to the tune of about $0.24. And so we don't plan for that type of extreme or mild weather and that type of extreme storm activity. And so in a normalized year, we'd like to think that, that offers a tailwind going into 2018. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Just a quick clarification, since you mentioned the tax item just not for 2018. Anything about describing the $0.05 benefit here in the -- I suppose it would've been the third quarter here on this Slide 2? Rejji Hayes : Yes, happy to provide some color on that. So the $0.05 benefit realized in Q3, that's largely attributable to a reduction in deferred income taxes associated with electric sales into MISO. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much for the detail. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hi, guys. Rejji Hayes : Hey, Michael, how are you? Michael Weinstein : Hey, just a follow-up on some of Julian's questions. When you think about the $7 billion of opportunity for CapEx, how do you say -- I know that half you said is from distribution transmission that were have been supply. Understood the supply is probably going to be dealt within the IRP. But on the T&D side, how do you think about pacing of when you can possibly move that into the official $18 billion side of the forecast, the one that's not an opportunity, but actually part of the plan going forward? Patti Poppe : I'll start and then as Rejji wants to add some additional comments. We have this -- the commission has requested a five-year distribution plan and we will -- we filed an initial version in August, we're receiving comments and having working sessions with the staff at the commission right now. We'll be submitting a final plan in January. And as through that plan -- and this is what I think is really a great part of what the commission is leading right now, these longer-term viewpoints of where the right investments in infrastructure exist. And so what will -- filling in our IRP in the spring of next year in conjunction with this T&D distribution, in particular, five-year modernization plan, we'll have a really good picture about where the investment opportunities are and have some real alignment with the commission and agreement about what those investments will be. And frankly, because of the age and the size and scope of our system, we have internal competition with trying to decide where best to put the dollars because there's so many parts of the distribution system and the supply system that require investment. And then when you layer in our gas, our large gas system, we've got -- our constraint is not \u2018Do we have capital we can do?\u2019 The constraint is customer's ability to pay, which is why we put so much emphasis on reducing the cost of that infrastructure in any way possible, so that we can provide more value for every dollar that we invest. And so that's where been working on. And so with the five-year distribution plan and the IRP combined, we'll be able to build out that five-year investment strategy in much more detail and with a lot more certainty. Michael Weinstein : Do you think there is a possibility that the $7 billion on opportunities can also be expanded as you work your way through, both this plan and the IRP? Patti Poppe : Yes, we do. And again, it's only constrained by customers' ability to pay, so that in the 10-year time horizon, in particular, when we have these PPAs that do peel off and are at the end of their contractual life, that creates some real headroom to make additional investments without raising customers' prices beyond what they can afford. And so that definitely is a key ingredient in our 10-year plan. Rejji Hayes : Michael, this is Rejji. The only thing I would add to that's all 100% for right. And just to give you some specifics, as you may recall from Investor Day, Garrick went into great detail on the volume of capital investment opportunities that we have, just given the age of our system. And so on the electric side, we talked about the average age of the system, I think 75% to our assets were constructed before 1970 and the industry average about 65%, we also just have a very old gas distribution mains, most of which -- a good portion of which were constructed around World War II. And so there's a lot of opportunities there, if you extrapolate on that math, there well in excess of the $25 billion that we've highlighted in our $18 billion 10-year plan plus $7 billion of upside opportunity. So there's a lot of capital investment opportunities. And as Patti noted, the key constraint is, obviously, affordability, so if we can accelerate the cost reduction or savings and that will allow us to execute on the upside opportunities as well. Michael Weinstein : Right. Make sense. Thank you very much. Patti Poppe : Thanks Mike. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Jonathan. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : I was just curious, so again this tax item in the quarter sounds like it was largely to do with cross period, so probably a one-timer, is that fair? Rejji Hayes : Yes, largely one-timer, there could be a little bit of upside to the tune of about $0.01 in 2018, but largely one-timer. Jonathan Arnold : Rejji, my question is, is there something that you sort of anticipated going into this year or was it the timing or fortuitous or had it not -- had you not got this, how would you be feeling around the range? What are the other things you could've done, et cetera? Rejji Hayes : I'll answer the last question first and then I'll get to your initial part of your question. But we would feel good about our ability to hit our fourth quarter full year, and then going forward, feel good about hitting our financial objectives, irrespective of whether this tax opportunity came about. The reality is, we're $0.16 ahead of plan and the tax savings that we realized in this quarter would have -- absent that, would have still be about $0.10 ahead of plan. And so it was helpful but it's not what we\u2019re hanging our hat on. And as always, we managed to work accordingly in the event we have unexpected variances like weather, like storms and this is just yet another example of us identifying cost savings opportunities. So that's sort of quick answer to the last part of the questions. As for the initial part, we've actually been evaluating this deferred income tax reduction opportunity for some time and what allowed us to take advantage of it this quarter was that there were couple legal precedents that emerged that allowed us -- and there will be more disclosure around this in the queue but allowed us to revisit our methodology for portioning electric sales into MISO and that's really the gist of why we took advantage of this opportunity now. Jonathan Arnold : Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you. Good morning. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Ali. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha : Good morning. Looking at the data, year-to-date weather normalized electric sales were running behind your full year target, any insight into that? And does that change your long-term planning for weather normalized sales going forward? Rejji Hayes : The quick answer, Ali, and we've -- this has been kind of recurring theme for the first couple of quarters of the year and now the third quarter. We actually feel like we're trending quite well on a weather normalized basis. And so as you may recall on our fourth quarter earnings call, we forecasted about 0.5% growth on the weather normalized electric sales. And that's net of energy efficiency programs. And if you look at the data on Page 13 of our pack, we're about, call it, 40 basis points. And what has been really in excess of our expectations has been the performance on the commercial side. And so you can see from a commercial perspective, we are about 1.5% up year-over-year. Industrial, which was down 1% in the first half of the year is now, basically, flat and so that's starting to turn around, so we're seeing good industrial activity. And residential was strong for the first half of the year, up about 50 basis points or 0.5% and it's now about flat. But I think what the residential trends do not pick up in the third quarter is that, like most of the country, we had very nice weather and the latter part of September, which effectively is not picked up in our performance but will be picked up in October. So effectively, those sales are still on the meter. And so we're trending not only on target to get to about 0.5% to 1% of growth year-over-year by the end of the year, but also the sales mix has been quite favorable over the first half of the year and it continues on to this Q3. So we're very pleased, actually, with the performance to-date. Is that helpful? Ali Agha : Yes, yes. It is, thank you. And secondly, the last 12 months earned ROEs weather normalized both electric and gas are above your authorized, any concerns with that as you're going through the rate cases or do you think that gets reduced by the future CapEx opportunities? Rejji Hayes : Yes. That should normalize over time. I think we're, maybe 10 to 20 basis points on the electric side above the authorized ROE, and so that's probably has to do a little bit of lag attributable to some of the cost savings, and just not having the opportunity to pass this on as soon as we'd like. But we obviously, as we always do, we pass this on as quickly as we can through the annual rate filings. And on the gas side, I'm sure you noted that we are well below the authorized ROE and that's because of the loss of self implementation attributable to the new energy law that was implemented in April of this year. And so again, we expect those to normalize over time and 10 to 20 basis points above the authorized level, we think, again, that will get back to authorized levels fairly very soon. Ali Agha : Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller : Good morning. Thank you. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Travis. Travis Miller : I was thinking about the regulatory activities. One short-term question, one long-term question, just wondering if you could point out one of the key 2018 regulatory decisions or filings or other activities that might change that guidance range or put you at the top-end or the low end? Patti Poppe : Well, okay, so we do have some significant regulatory outcomes in 2018 planned. But as it relates to our guidance, our 6% to 8%, that's -- as I mentioned, we work every year under a variety of changing conditions, whether regulatory outcomes, politics et cetera, we always work to make sure that we can adapt to those changing conditions, and that's the strength of this business model. So I think, as you're thinking about our 2018 guidance, I would stay anchored in that point that our strength comes from our simple but powerful business model. It has strong CapEx underpinned by cost savings, ongoing throughout the year. And then a real core competence and adaptability. A lot of people do point to our business model and I love it and it's straightforward and I can see why we would. But one of the core strengths of this company, and Rejji highlighted it in his remarks, is the fact that no matter what comes we managed to work it out because we don't have big bets, because we're not waiting on one big regulatory outcome because we're not waiting on one big project to get approved, we can adapt to make those changes throughout the year and manage to deliver for all of you. And for 14 years in a row, delivering 7% EPS growth. We feel pretty good about our track record and what we're trying to share is that we have plenty of visibility and to being able to deliver it to again going forward. Travis Miller : Okay, and then the long term question was how sensitive is that long-term growth number to that IRP filing and whatever outcome plus or minus that might come about? Patti Poppe : I think, if anything, the IRP provides more certainty to the performance because we'll have more visibility into longer-term planning and be able to do more cost effective investments and cost effective generation, which is how our model works. The heart of our model is that our system is large and aging and we have significant infrastructure replacement upgrades enhancements required. And so any certainty we can have going forward allows us to most cost effectively do those upgrades and make the changes necessary. We have a large and aging system between the gas and electric. And so really we look forward to certainty that the IRP can provide so that we can do really even better planning than we've been able to do in the past. Rejji Hayes : The only other point I would add is, obviously, the utility drives a good portion, the lion share of our earnings on an annual basis. But we still have the unregulated businesses as both enterprises and other banks that provide additional levers to risk mitigate our annual plan, and then obviously, we will seek out cost reduction opportunities, either operating our non-operating to make sure that we can again risk mitigate any unfavorable regulatory outcomes. Travis Miller : Great. Thanks. I appreciate it. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Travis. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Levi of Avon Capital. Please go ahead. Andrew Levi : Hi. Good morning. Patti Poppe : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Levi : Just real quick, because I've been off and on. Just on this deferred tax item, I don't know if I heard it correctly, but is it what potential that there could be upside to this year's number if you deem to book more of that? Is that... Rejji Hayes : No, no. We would say the $0.05 of realized benefit in this quarter, that respectively it for 2017 and there may be $0.01 of upside next year as I highlight. But I wouldn't expect anything further beyond that in this fiscal year. Is that helpful? Andrew Levi : Okay, okay, because I thought -- first I heard there would be higher 2017, obviously this rate can change your 2017 a little bit. And then you'd have a higher base to grow off of, and that would change 2018, 2019, whatever. But that's not the case so I missed -- I misheard. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Andy. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Poppe for any closing remarks. Patti Poppe : Well, thanks everyone for joining us and we do look forward to seeing you at EEI, right around the corner. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

Analysts: Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Ali Agha - SunTrust Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CMS Energy 2017 Year End Results and Outlook Call. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call beginning today at 12 :00 pm Eastern time, running through February 21st. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Sri Maddipati : Good morning and Happy Valentine's Day, everyone. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I will turn the call over to Patti. Patti Poppe : Thank you, Sri and thank you everyone for joining us today. Rejji and I are excited to share our 2017 results with you and our 2018 goals. I've scrubbed all of our stories of the month and have selected our wining story of the year, which I will unveil today. Rejji will provide the financial results and an update on Federal Tax Reform and as always we look forward to your questions. We delivered a strong performance in 2017 adding another year to our consistent track record of 7% EPS growth without reset. Operationally we manage challenging weather and storms throughout the year and financially we were able to deliver the results you have come to expect. I'm pleased to report that our adjusted EPS was $2.17 a strong 7% above the prior year which excludes the one-time non-cash effects of Federal Tax Reform. As Rejji will discuss in more detail tax reform will have a long-term positive impact on our business model. In the near term given the significant savings provided our customers will benefit from lower rates which leads to manageable operating cash flow reductions in longer term the lower builds will provide headroom for necessary capital investments. In 2017, we continued to grow our operating cash flow well surpassing our target and yielding an FFO to debt ratio of approximately 20%, which provides plenty of cushion for the potential cash flow impacts of tax reform. For 2018, we are raising our guidance to a range of $2.30 to $2.34 which reflects 6% to 8% annual growth from our 2017 actual EPS. We are also increasing the dividend to $1.43 per share consistent with our expected earnings growth. Longer term we are reaffirming our growth rate of 6% to 8% and we continued to be confident in our ability to deliver another year of consistent industry-leading performance. As I stated in the past, we're highly confident in 7% annual growth has demonstrated in 2017, a year where we experience atypical weather and a record level of storms in our service territory, yet we still delivered. As we think about our guidance range for 2018, we will focus on executing our capital plans and realizing cost savings to the CE Way. Admittedly given the strength of our plan for 2018 and the reinvestments we've made in 2017, we'd be pretty disappointed if we didn't finish the year toward the high end of the range. Our commitment to people, planet and profits are tripled bottom line continues to serve us well driving a year of record setting milestones in safety, service and customer satisfaction. In fact, our safety performance was our best ever and put us number one amongst our peers. Nothing is more important and it's a great demonstration of the quality of people here at CMS that are focused and safe every single day. We were ranked and awarded a number of third party surveys including being named the Best place to work and the Best Employer for Diversity in Michigan by Forbes Magazine and the number US utility by Sustainalytics for the second-year in a year. It's no surprise that my co-workers and I love working for such a purpose driven company that continues to demonstrate the financial performance and sustainability go hand-in-hand. Yet we're dissatisfied and committed to continuously improving our performance every day. For example, we told a year ago that we only fulfilled our customer commitments on time 9% at the time. Our goal was to reach 50% by the end of 2017, dramatic improvements. With the utilization of the CE Way, the team was able to deliver even better than planned. I'm happy to report that we finished the year at 60% commitments made on time and yet, we still have so much work to do. Each of these remaining missed appointments is a cost both to our customer and to our [audio gap] proved customer experience and cost savings that the CE Way unlocks. I applaud my co-workers and their relentless dedication to continuously improving our performance. You can count on us to leverage the CE Way to enable our triple bottom line of serving our customer and communities, protecting and improving the planet and delivering strong and predictable financial results. Now as you know, I've a series of stories that I call my story of the month. There is nothing like an example to bring to life the power, the consumer's energy way and its impact on our continued performance. I reviewed all of our stories last year and have selected the best of the best for my story of the year. As we shared many times, our business model is fueled by needed infrastructure investments on our aging system partially funded by cost reduction to protect customers from prices they can't afford. Our core competence of cost reduction is enabled by capital investment which often reduce O&M. our process improvement to the CE Way and effective technology deployment. My story of the year is an example of how the whole model works. Last year, we completed the installation of our smart meters which was a multi-year capital program designed with customer benefits in mind from day one. Our smart meters have enabled a dramatic improvement in meter read rate and thereby improved billing accuracy while significantly reducing costs. When we don't read the meter rate the first time, we rely on estimated bills which are inevitably error-prone and create waste for both customer and the company. Utilizing smart meter technology and significant process improvement we've been able to reduce invoice reversals by 90% since 2013, reduced calls to our call centers and reduced truck rolls investigating perceived billing errors. As a result this has saved well over $10 million for our customers and better yet, it freed up time to solve another problem. Customer's struggling to keep up with their bills. The very same people who were spending time correcting bills were freed up and they designed and launched a new payment program called CARE. Which enables customers to pay on time and rewards them for doing so, by reducing their arrears adjust as they go creating a new pattern of payment and household stability? We've reduced shut-offs by 30%, while at the same time reducing our uncollected accounts by $34 million or over 50%. We were able to protect our most vulnerable customer and lower cost for everyone. We awarded our billing team our first Annual Purpose Award this year for their demonstration of world-class performance delivering hometown service. We're creating a culture of performance and celebrating our success. And 99% meter-read rate, a 90% reduction in invoice reversals and a 50% reduction in uncollected accounts was definitely worthy of celebration. True waste elimination. By making smart investments, improving our processes enabled by the CE Way and deploying technology we've substantially reduced cost. Which we will return to our customers to fuel new investments which can add even more value for them. This model works and there is lot more steam in the boiler for the future. Stay tuned for more stories to come. We're celebrating on the run and have kicked off 2018 with gusto. Safety is always our number one priority and we aim to make this year's safety performance even better than last year's record result. We have a strong regulatory model in Michigan that is time bound, transparent, allows us to have forward-looking visibility as well as utilization of our investment recovery mechanism in gas. And as a result of the 2016 Energy Law have added an IRP filing. In parallel the Commission had ordered a five-year electric distribution plan as well. These long-term regulatory filings allow us to plan for the future, which reduces risk and provides for more predictable regulatory outcome. As always we plan to meet all of our financial objectives for the year and Rejji will take you through those along with tax details. We will continue to drive our triple bottom line delivering the consistent world-class results for our customers and you. Our model is simple, durable and continues to deliver. The self-fund a large portion of our earnings growth. We look at our cost structure. We look at everything. O&M, fuel, PPAs, interest expense and yes, taxes. Tax reform is good for our customers and our model. We believe tax reform will fuel the economic momentum across the country and especially right here in Michigan and we plan to be a bit part of that growth. I attended our State of the State Address in mid-January and the optimism was palpable. The Governor even bragged a little bit which is pretty uncharacteristic of Michigan's famed nerd. Governor Snyder shared that Michigan is the number one Great Lake State for inbound college educated talent. Has the sixth highest income growth in the nation and has created the most manufacturing jobs in the country. The Governor reiterated his commitment to infrastructure in Michigan. All of this is good news for our customers and CMS Energy. As we've mentioned. We have a very large and aging system because we have so much needed infrastructure investment. Our internal teams literally compete with one another for project approvals. We have a rigorous prioritization and approval process for work that significantly improves the safety of our system, the reliability of our systems and often reduces our cost, which is the trifecta for customers. We're the fourth largest gas utility in the nation in terms of miles of pipe and that system is going through a refresh overtime. With nearly 1,700 miles of large transmission pipe and 27,000 miles of distribution mains. It will take decades to replace all of it. We plan to continue to align with our regulators on the prioritization and sequence of these needed investments. Our electric distribution system is older than our peers. Our current plan calls for focus on poles, wires and substation nothing fancy, but the basic building blocks of a resilient system. Finding mains and making every capital dollar count. We can deliver more value for customers and enable the long-term delivery of our financial objective. In the latter half of our five-year distribution plan, we began to add smarter grid technology and modernization which can better optimize and utilize our infrastructure. And we're proud of the way, we self-fund these necessary infrastructure investments through our commitment to cost reductions. When we look at the total cost structure we realized the bulk of our cost are not just to operate and maintain the system. Fuel and purchase power costs are larger than O&M and these are pass-throughs than our regulatory construct here in Michigan, but they're still real expenses for our customers and add no value for our investors. We've reduced fuel prices by shifting from colder gas generation and that saves our customers money, but there is more work to be done. Our PPAs provide a significant opportunity in the very near future to reduce cost for our customers even more and fund necessary capital investments across our system at a lower cost. As we lower total cost, we can be more attractive to companies considering Michigan for their expansion or relocation because when Michigan wins, we win. When Michigan grows, so does our business. We are actively engaged in economic development and in fact we're awarded the Deal of the Year for our work with the locating of switch data center in Grand Rapids, the heart of our electric service territory. By providing energy ready sites we work closely with our communities and policy leaders to make it easier for new businesses to expand or move to Michigan. Last year alone we attracted 69 additional megawatts of new load and there is more fish on the hook. In addition to growth, many of our new and expanding customers are looking for help to achieve their renewable energy goal. We're partnering with those companies for success with our recently announced Green Pricing package. Yet we still plan conservatively. We only add the load to our model and our sale forecast when it has actually materialized. The proof is in the pudding. We achieved almost 2% industrial load growth in 2017. Our regulatory calendar is on pace this year, especially with the continued implementation of the 2016 Energy Law and the new Federal Tax policy. We are working with our regulators to pass the tax savings onto our customers. We made a filing on January 19 indicating our preference which as you'd expect, is to keep it simple and apply a credit on every bill and we are waiting the MPSC's order on [indiscernible] like this credit applied. The new Energy Law requires us to file a long-term integrated resource plan. We anticipate filing that in June. Furthermore, to meet Michigan's new 15% renewable portfolio standard we have filed a plan to build over 500 megawatts of new renewables and expect the commission order on that plan later this year. Our IRP will provide insight to our future generation mix and enable the commission to go on the record with their view of our plan. Again the regulatory construct in Michigan is transparent, directed through statue, time bound and forward-looking. Therefore provides investment certainty ahead of our actual expenditures no big bets and no surprises. Our rate cases remain on track to deliver cost savings and service improvements to our customers, we expect an order by the end of March on our electric rate case and we're still in the gas case, but expect a constructive outcome there as well. No matter the external factors, our business model has stood the test of time in changing environments. For us to deliver the consistent strong performance you come to expect. We work closely with everyone. Without counting on the weather or other recess [ph] to EPS. Over the last 12 years, we have continued to pay a competitive dividend that has grown along with earning. When we combine the two, our earnings and dividend growth, we yield a double-digit total shareholder return. Over the past 10 years in fact, we've delivered TSR that's three times the performance of the UTY and more than twice the performance of the S&P 500. 2018 will be the 16th year of track record you've come to know and enjoy and we intend to keep it that way for many years to come. Now I will turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you Patti and good morning, everyone. As always we greatly appreciate your interest in our company. As we reported earlier this morning for 2017 we delivered adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.17 which is toward the high end of our guidance and reflects at another year of 7% annual growth. Our adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter excludes $0.52 non-cash, non-recurring charge associated with Federal Tax reform. This charge is largely attributable to the remeasurement of deferred tax asset, which now reflect a reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate to 21% and 35%. We're quite pleased with our performance for the year particular in light of the $0.15 of negative variance associated with mild temperatures and storms realized over the course of the year, which more than offset by cost savings, rate increases, net investments and outperformance at dig among other factors. As always, we take the good with the bad and manage to work accordingly to meet our operational and financial objectives, the benefit of our customers and investors. Slide 14 best illustrates the resilience of our business model, during periods of unfavorable weather. We rely on our ability to flex operational and financial levers to meet our objectives. 2017 was no different as we experienced mild temperatures and heavy storm activity throughout most of the year and our team responded with cost performance and sound financial planning to deliver the consistent and predictable results you expect. Similar to our past practice, we continue to reinvest in the business during periods of favorable weather or upon realization of cost reductions in access of plan. These reinvestments entail pulling ahead work such as forestry, refinancing high coupon bonds and supporting our low income customers among other opportunities. In fact over the past five years we've reinvested almost $500 million in aggregate due to favorable weather and strong cost performance. These reinvestments support our long-term goals and provide more certainty around our operational and financial objectives in the next year and for years to come. Rounding our 2017 Slide 15 lists all of our financial targets for the year and as noted, we met or exceeded every single one of them which adds another year to our long history of delivering transparent and consistent performance. The highlight of couple of noteworthy items in addition to achieving 7% annual EPS growth, we grew our dividend commensurately and generated over $1.7 billion of operating cash flow. Our steady cash for generation over the years continuous to fortify our balance sheet as evidenced by our strong FFO to debt ratio which had approximately 20% at yearend exceeds both the 2017 target and our historical target range of 17% to 19%. Our conservative of the balance sheet provides sufficient headroom to manage unforeseen headwinds and support strong investment grade credit ratings which enable us to fund our capital plan cost efficiently to the benefit of customers and investors. Lastly, in accordance with our self-funding model we kept annual price increases below 2% for both the gas and electric businesses which align with our target of keeping annual price increases at or below inflation. All well investing a record level capital investment of $1.9 billion at the utility. As you've grown accustomed, we usually take this time to adjust our EPS guidance based on actual results as such you'll note on Slide 16 that we're increasing both the bottom and top end of our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance to $2.30 to $2.34 which is a $0.01 above our initial guidance during our third quarter call and imply 6% to 8% annual growth off our 2017 actual results. As for the path to our 2018 EPS guidance range as illustrated in our waterfall chart on Slide 17. We plan for normal weather, which in this case will contribute approximately $0.16 of positive year-over-year EPS variance given the substandard weather experience in 2017, however needless to say we believe we have sufficient risk mitigation in our plan in the event the weather does not corporate. Additionally, we anticipate about $0.06 of EPS pick up associated with our pending electric and gas rate cases, net investment cost and another $0.03 from cost savings which implies a 2% year-over-year reduction in costs which we believe is highly achievable given our track record. For our estimates, these sources of positive variance will be partially offset by select non-operating savings realized in 2017 that will either be passed onto customers through our pending cases or one-time in nature. We also have embedded the usual conservatism in our utility sales and non-utility performance forecast. Moving onto Federal tax reform like most large companies the new tax law impacts our business in a variety of ways. And as Patti mentioned, we believe tax reform will ultimately be accretive to our long-term plan. At the utility, we filed a recommendation on January 19 to the MPSC on how to reflect the new tax law in customer rates. As part of that filing we proposed an estimated $165 million rate reduction for customers in 2018 and a separate proceeding to determine the treatment of deferred taxes. We were working closely with the Commission on this matter and though the amount and the pace at which the tax savings will be provided to customers in 2018 have yet to be determined, we believe the rate reduction could be up to 4% which clearly facilitates our self-funding strategy by creating meaningful headroom for future capital investments. As you know, we have significant investment requirements at the utility in the form of gas and electric infrastructure upgrades, PPA replacements and renewable investments. And the estimated cost savings associated with tax reform increase the likelihood of us incorporate more projects into our capital plan over the next five to 10 years to the benefit of customers and investors. In fact every 1% reduction in customer rates equates to approximately $400 million of incremental capital investment capacity. On the non-utility side tax reform impacts CMS in three ways. First, the new tax law establishes potential limitation on parent interest expense deductibility however we're uniquely positioned in this regard because our parent interest expense will be largely offset by the interest income generated by EnerBank, our industrial bank subsidiary. Second, our non-utility businesses would realize some upside given the lower federal income tax rate although this will not have a material impact on our consolidated earnings since those businesses are relatively small. And third as we've discussed in the past, the sum of non-utility operations produces an overall pre-tax loss due to our parent interest expense. In the past the overall loss of our non-utility operations produced a larger tax benefit at 35% tax rate than it will going forward at 21% rate. This equates to about $0.02 of EPS drag in 2018 that is already baked into our guidance and fully mitigated. Lastly the repeal of the alternative minimum tax provides us with the opportunity to monetize our substantial AMT credits over the next four years to the tune of approximately $125 million in the first year which partially offsets the likely near term operating cash flow reduction at the utility. In summary, the effects of tax reform manageable in the near term and create long-term opportunities which provide more certainty around our operational and financial objectives. To elaborate on the magnitude of the potential long-term opportunity. As Patti highlighted we have a robust capital investment backlog at the utility due to our large and aging electric and gas systems which has historically been executed at a measured pace given customer affordability constraint. Given the substantial rate reduction opportunity presented by tax reform in addition to the other aspects of our self-funding strategy we're forecasting a five-year capital investment program of approximately $10 billion which extends our runway for growth without comprising our annual price increase target of at or below inflation. The expected composition of this plan will be waited toward improving our gas infrastructure as well as upgrading our electric distribution system and investing in more renewable generation. This level of investment will increase our utility rate base from approximately $15 billion from 2017 to $21 billion in 2022 which implies a 7% compound annual growth rate. This extension of our five-year capital plan will further improve the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems, the benefit of our customers, evolve our generation portfolio to the benefit of the planet and extend the runway for EPS growth to the benefit of investors. Beyond the next five years our capital investment needs are significant likely in excess of $50 billion in the long run. As we discussed during our investor day in September and as evidenced in the circular chart on Slide 19. As you can imagine over the next 10 years our capital plan will be greater than our previously disclosed $18 billion plan out of the amount and composition of a revised 10-year plan. Will be dictated by the analyses being performed in our upcoming long-term electric distribution and integrated resource planned filings as well as the commission decisions as to how they intend to address the new tax law. As such our longer term estimates will evolve as our regulatory filings progress. From a liquidity perspective while tax reform alleviates the customer affordability constraint, it does create manageable headwinds in regards to operating cash flow as I alluded to earlier. As a result of the potential reduction of customer rates due to tax reform we anticipate a flat year-over-year operating cash flow trend from 2018 to 2019 at $1.65 billion but expect to resume our trend of $100 million per year increases by 2020. In aggregate we're forecasted to generate approximately $9 billion of operating cash flow over the next five years which will play a key role in the financing strategy of our five-year capital plan. In support of our liquidity planning, we also expect to continue to avoid paying substantial federal taxes until 2022. In sum, our forecasted OCF generation coupled with our tax yield portfolio enables us to continue to finance our capital investment program in a cost efficient manner. As result of our solid cash flow generation and conservative financing strategy which includes a modest ATM equity issuance program, our credit quality has improved significantly over the past 15 years as evidenced by our strong credit metrics and numerous ratings upgrades. We've also opportunistically refinanced high coupon bonds such as the partial redemption of our eight and three quarter senior notes at the parent in the fourth quarter which has reduced cost and mitigated refinancing risk. As of December 31, our fixed to floating ratio was approximately 95% with a weighted average bond tenure of 13 years. Which largely insulates our income statements in the prospect of rising interest rates? This prudent balance sheet management has enabled us to absorb the effects of tax reform while extending our capital plan without issuing substantial amounts of equity. As you can see on the right-hand side of Slide 21 our FFO to debt ratio is projected to be approximately 18% by year end which includes the effects of federal tax reform and assumes no change to the size of our ATM equity issuance program in 2018. On Slide 22, we have listed our financial targets for 2018 and beyond. In short we anticipate another great year with 6% to 8% EPS growth, no big bets and robust risk mitigation. This model has and will continue to serve our customers well they realize lower gas and electric prices from our self-funding strategy which is enhanced through tax reform as well as our investors who can continue to count on consistent industry leading financial performance. Few companies are able to deliver top end earnings growth while improving value and service for customers year after, year after, year and we're pleased to have delivered another year consistent industry leading performance in 2017 and expect to continue on this path in 2018. On Slide 23, we've refreshed our sensitivities for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note with reasonable planning assumptions and robust risk mitigation the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. There will always be sources of volatility in this business be it weather, fuel cost, regulatory outcomes or otherwise and every year we view it as our mandate to do the warning for you and mitigate the risk accordingly. And with that I'll hand it back to Patti for some closing remarks before Q&A. Patti Poppe : Thank you Rejji. With our unique self-funding model enhanced by tax reform, a constructive regulatory environment and a large and aging system in need of fundamental capital investments. We feel that our investment thesis is quite compelling. Now Rocco, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you very much Patti. [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So perhaps just first thing on the EPS growth you guys talk now about enterprises and tax planning. I know you talked broadly about it, but how do you reconcile against this 2% addition that you throw in there in terms of self-funding and then also, can you just be a little clear about the year-by-year equity contemplated in the current plan? Rejji Hayes : Yes, so with respect to enterprises Julien as you know that has always been kind of one of several components of the self-funding strategy and so our self-funding strategy is largely predicated on the cost cuts as well as little bit of sales growth and then a combination of tax planning unregulated or non-utility contribution and other have allowed us to get to that sort of 75% of funding of the 6% to 8% growth which again minimizes the annual rate relief request. And so enterprise has always been part of that plan as EnerBank and their contribution is relatively modest but helpful. So that's effectively how we see that one. With respect to your second question on the equity issuance, it's historically our at-the-market equity dribble or equity issuance program was around $60 million to $70 million on a run rate basis and that's what we've been doing for some time and so foresee based on the implications of tax reform we don't see that changing in 2018 but longer term we expect the modest increase of that, to call out the tune of about $20 million to $30 million and so we think, run rate it's probably around $110 million to $115 million but not much higher than that, so we still think we can comfortably fund that within the dribble program it's well south of about 1.5% of our market cap and we think again highly digestible. Is that helpful? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. Thank you. Perhaps turning to the CapEx side of the equation, perhaps two-fold here first. If I have this right, you increased the overall pie to $50 billion number now and just curious if there is anything to read into that, just in terms of the updates, it give you that incremental confidence now. And then secondly more specifically, as we think about this upcoming filing on the distribution front and finalizing that here. Is there anything else from a regulatory perspective you all might be looking at to improve your ability to concurrently earn on that maybe thinking of trackers here on the distribution front, but you know curious? Patti Poppe : So on the $50 billion, I think we were pretty clear at our Investor day and we continue to be consistent in our message that our system is large and aging and so the point of the $50 billion and you'll see that it's a - at least or approximately because the size of the opportunities is well more than our customers can afford and so this constraint of customer affordability and a healthy balance sheet and our credit ratings and credit metrics is an important combination that we're always trying to work, so the issue and what we're trying to reinforce is that there is no limit to how much work needs to be done, it's all about managing our cost and making sure that we can get more value for every single dollar that we invest all across the system and so that our customers can have a better experience at a lower price and so - capital is not the - availability of capital opportunities is not the constraint and that's the point of the $50 billion. On the distribution front, we're excited about this filing for a couple of reasons. Number one, its paints a nice five-year picture of the investment potential and strategy and results and outcomes that can be delivered from those investments. It also creates the framework for discussion with the commission. There is nothing embedded in that filing that changes the regulatory construct or modifies our approvals or implies long-term tracking mechanisms but I do think that, by having the open visibility the opportunity to have a good rich discussion with both the staff and commission about the investment priorities. We can provide more certainty to our regulatory outcomes and de-risk the financial plan in the long run. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you all. Operator : And our next question today comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : First question on the electric rate case, can you just remind us how to reconcile the ALJ proposed decision to your ask? I mean just the dollar amount there's a huge difference there. How are you looking at that in the context of how that fits into your financial plan? Patti Poppe : The ALJ is just another step in the process. It's not a file Commission order just to be clear. The Commission speaks with their orders. There's a couple big discrepancy, number one is their ROE of 9.8. we look at the most recent gas order that the Commission issued and they reiterated that 9.8 is too low and 10.1 wasn't appropriate ROE at this time and so that was not that long ago and so we feel that's a difference as well as, they had two other what I would describe as distinct differences to traditional rate making that we've been doing specifically around forecasting sales, around our energy efficiency and including them or not including them. We've always included our forecasted energy efficiency sales reductions in forward-looking rate making and so the ALJ opted to eliminate that, that was about $18 million difference as well as discount rate calculation. So there was very specific things that the ALJ pointed to that were very different than what has been traditional. So our final order is expected near the end of March and our commission is very competent and capable and they'll weigh all of the inputs and we expect a favorable outcome. Rejji Hayes : Ali this is Rejji. The only thing I would add to Patti's good points is that, as it pertains to ROE. If you look at the fac [ph] pattern now versus where we were in not too distant past, when the commission gave the decision for the gas case at the end of July. The tenure treasury was about 2.3% and well I think we all know what has taken place since then, we've had about 55 to 60 basis points of ascension and then you've had tax reform which has taken place, which is obviously leading to inflationary pressure as well as the prospect of rates rising beyond where they are today, you couple that with what is realistic credit quality deterioration across lot of utilities in the sector and so I think in light of how the fac [ph] pattern is changed to me again. I think ROEs and where they will ultimately end up. I think it's very difficult to make a case for something below 10% at this point, but ultimately as Patti highlighted the Commission will speak through their order, so we'll see. Ali Agha : Right and then second question, the weather normalized electric sales for the year ended up 0.4% which was below your targeted range for the year. I'm just wondering if that changes your thinking going forward. I think you've been assuming like a 1% or similar kind of growth rate for sales going forward, just wondering how the 2017 outcome impacts your forward thinking there. Rejji Hayes : Yes, so Ali I would actually beg to differ slightly with your position, yes we talked about electric sales forecast between call 0.5% to 1% beginning of the year and that's obviously weather normalize in net of energy efficiency, but as we've said throughout 2017 we've actually been tickled pink with the mix of sales that we've seen throughout the year, so it's interesting as you look at that and 40 basis points where we ended up and peeled the onion on that some residential was roughly flat, our forecast beginning the year assumed about 1.5% decline again net of energy efficiency and weather normalized and so flat performance there was really above expectation and so that is higher margin sales as you know and so that was upside relative to plan. And then on the commercial side that's really where we saw a quite a bit of performance there and so we're just under 1% weather normalized net of energy efficiency and our plan beginning of the year was about 1% down and so and that implies where you saw a little bit underperformance was on the industrial side, but to end the year got it just under 2% weather normalized net of energy efficiency again below our plan, but still that's a very nice mix and really suggest that we have a pretty good economic environment and pretty diversified service territory which is not nearly as cyclical as other parts of the state and so we were quite impressed with that and going forward we do not expect to see a modest degradation of that performance from a sales perspective going forward, but generally we do plan conservatively so we'll see, but again not disappointed at all with where we ended up. Ali Agha : I see and last question, just to clarify if I heard the remarks right. As you look about your CapEx plans and factored in the headroom from tax reform. Did I hear it right the next five-year CapEx plan we should not expect any changes in terms of the amounts to that but likely the 10-year plan amounts will likely go up? Did I hear that correctly? Rejji Hayes : No, no so just to be clear. You have a couple of things that are moving in the five-year plan. So the prior five-year plan was 17 through 21 that was $9 billion plan which presuppose about $1.8 billion per year, we've moved one-year forward, so this is now 18 to 22 plan and so this plan five years in aggregate is about $10 billion, that implies about $2 billion of spend per year, so you've seen a step up there in terms of the aggregate spend and where we have decided to err in the side conservatism is we're not in a position at this point to provide more disclosure on the 10-year plan. Now the only thing we've highlighted on the slide is that, we fully expect it to be an excess of $18 billion given that the prior 10-year plan pre-tax reform was $18 billion and so if you assume with the likely significant customer rate reductions associate with tax reform, that gives us substantial headroom to increase the capital plan to the benefit of customers and investors. So hopefully that's clear now. Ali Agha : Yes, thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : I heard you mentioned the IRP is kind of the next catalyst to talk more about - expansion of the five and 10-year plan, but is the five-year distribution plan which I think is coming up, the filing is coming up in March. Is that also another point where you might see more of that $50 billion talked about? Patti Poppe : Yes. And this really - the timing of these in parallel is really productive to have the IRP and the electric distribution plans filed within a couple months of each other. The distribution plan does not result in an order per se, financial approval, but the IRP does and so I would say the IRP provides more financial certainty but the distribution plan in concert with it does show and will demonstrate than the mix of electric spend for sure as part of that five-year $10 billion plan. Michael Weinstein : Great that makes sense. Maybe you could just highlight a little bit of the possible upside for dig as it results of the state and liability mechanism which just was recently set? Rejji Hayes : Michael this is Rejji. So couple things to think about there, so the charge was established in late November by the MPSC and I think they assumed about just over $300 per megawatt day for the charge that would potentially be levied to AES, is our Alternative Electric Supplier who cannot demonstrate they have requisite capacity four years forward. That translates into about $9 per kilowatt month price in the capacity market and so we assume that anything above $3 per kilowatt month is upside dig and so while we don't think that will create opportunities in the near term certainly longer term particularly if there is a local clearing requirement that's established beyond 2021. We definitely think there could be some opportunities for dig to be competitive in that environment, but certainly we haven't baked in any of that into our plan because it's too premature for that. Michael Weinstein : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question today comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Most of my questions have been answered, but I do have one with regard to the IRP at a very high level. 15-year plan. You still have a fairly significant amount of power generation coming from coal. You also have you know Palisades and MCV PPA is expiring in the mid 2020s. So should we expect to see sort of resource plan that talks about how we're going to replace those PPAs and sort of decarbonize the remaining fleet in the context of this IRP. How aggressive a tilt towards renewable might we see given how much more economic they're becoming especially as we move out into that timeframe? Patti Poppe : Great question Greg. Thanks for asking. The IRP plan will definitely reflect our clean and lean generation strategy that will have retirements of coal and it's actually a 20-year time horizon that you'll see, you'll see through 2040 in that plan and our decarbonization of our generation fleet will be a big thing that you'll see, the economics of renewable continues to improve and we see that as an important part of our mix going forward in addition to energy waste, reduction through peak reduction through demand response as well as our energy efficiency programs in total. So we're excited to get that IRP out in public that will really show our commitment to being a key part in sustainable energy future. We're excited. I will just make one note Greg that we have retired seven of our 12 coal units. We've retired almost a gigawatt of coal and so we're actually down dramatically in our generation fleet, with coal. And so we feel great about where we are, we've reduced our carbon intensity by 38% since 2008 levels. We definitely are leaders that's why Sustainalytics I think continues to choose us as the number one utility and Newsweek Magazine selected us one of the greenest companies. Independent of industry and the nation top 10. We're flanked by Apple and J&J in that top 10 ranking. Our commitment to carbon reduction is both in our actions and our forecasts. Greg Gordon : Thank you, Patti. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : When I look at Slide 15 while you give the target for 2018 financial targets and then I think the greenbox is the 2017, but can you just talk about what you've assumed on tax reform in terms of the pace of refund to customers in that plan. Does that assume what you mentioned so that would be relatively quick? So is that sort of some wiggle room around that, if it comes out slightly not so quick. Rejji Hayes : Yes, so we assumed we erred on the side of conservatism I'll say and so Jonathan for 2018, we assumed an excess of about $165 million of operating cash flow reduction. Where there is a little bit of I'll say uncertainty is around how the commission might treat deferred tax liability. So in the filing that we submitted on January 19, we highlighted that there was about $1.5 billion of deferred tax liabilities as of September 30 and we have proposed that matter should be adjudicated through separate proceeding and so as you know through normalization that could be basically returned to customers, over the life of the assets at least with the property related deferred taxes, but for the non-property it's, the new tax law is quite opaque and ambiguous around that. so it remains to be seen exactly how the rest to be returned, but to answer your question we're assuming I think something around 165 to 200 of degradation on 2018, but I could [indiscernible] once there is a decision around deferred tax is going forward. Jonathan Arnold : And as well as in that 18% FFO to debt. Rejji Hayes : That's exactly right and so we also have assumed as I highlighted that there is a modest countermeasure in the form of the monetization of the alternative minimum tax credits and so we have assumed that we will monetize about half of that, maybe $270 million on the sidelines and so we're getting about half of that. There's a little bit of sequestration around 7% so that equates to about $125 million. So that's a partial countermeasure and we'll do what we can do with cost reductions to offset one of that. But that's what [indiscernible]. Jonathan Arnold : I understand rightly Rejji. There's no doubt that you've got that in the lower, is that or on the AMT? Rejji Hayes : Yes - could not be more clear about that. The only risk is if there is a government shutdown or something that's very low probability, but you never know these days. Jonathan Arnold : All right and don't you have $500 million of deferred tax assets as well as the $1.5 billion of liability or excess? Rejji Hayes : That's correct, so we have it was subject to impairment of course as a result of the federal tax rate going from 35% to 21% and that's the lion share of that $0.52 non-recurring charge that we stomached in the fourth quarter, but still have a pretty large balance. And so at the end of 2017 it was just under $900 million now that's the gross value, it's not the cash benefit, but we still have a significant amount. By 2018, we expect that to step down to just over $500 million again on a gross basis and the cash benefit is less than that and so we still expect to utilize a lot of that NOL balance going forward. And at the utility there is about $500 million of deferred tax assets and again it's pretty ambiguous as to how quickly that might be returned or recovered by us and that's subject to separate proceeding that we proposed to the MPSC. Jonathan Arnold : Okay, can you just? That was the bit I was asking about. What have you proposed in terms of timing on that part? Rejji Hayes : We have basically said we - in our filing in 19 to the Commission that we would propose having that as part of the separate proceeding and so in our modeling we have not assumed that has resolved in any point soon, maybe a safe assumption is that, it aligns with the normalization of the property of deferred taxes but it all remains to be seen quite frankly. Jonathan Arnold : Okay, thank you. And then just can I clarify one other thing. I think if I heard you right, you said at various point that you thought that the tax reform will ultimately be accretive to the long-term plan and I think you said that you have about 4%, you anticipate having about 4% headroom and that each percentage point would give you capacity for another $400 million of investment. So if I can do that math that's sort of $1.6 billion potential incremental rate base. I know you've touched around this but what sort of timeframe should we think about partly extending the runway or is it bringing things forward and when you say accretive, are we talking earnings as well as whatever else? Patti Poppe : Jonathan what I would say, it's a tailwind to our model. It is consistent with our methodology of offsetting cost of capital by reducing cost for customers and enabling our long-term commitment to 6% to 8% EPS growth and so I would best at the highest level characterize it as extending the runway de-risking the plan further, making us to continue to sleep at night stock. It just enables us to continue to do what we do so well Jonathan. In fact you could probably sleep through the call if you want because there is no news, no surprises here. Jonathan Arnold : So if it's a tailwind does it by extension become something that makes it more likely that you'll execute above the 7% number or not. Patti Poppe : We've been very, very consistent. I appreciate the push Jonathan, but we're very confident around 7% and I know you're very happy with our 7.4% performance this year. We're shooting for that 6% to 8% range and certainly we'll be disappointed again as I mentioned in 2018, if we didn't hit near the top end of that guidance and we're just going to continue to work that direction and everything positive that helps, is exactly that. It's a tailwind. Jonathan Arnold : Well tailwinds are good. All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Greg [indiscernible] of UBS. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : In the slide deck you had equity infusion to consumers of about $300 million in 2018, $450 million in 2017 just wanted to understand how you think about that and sort of going forward? Rejji Hayes : So specifically Greg are speaking how we might fund that, is that the direction question? Unidentified Analyst : Really do you expect should we be thinking about what level of annual contributions to consumers going forward, if there is a way to think about how to model that? Rejji Hayes : Yes, so we can certainly spend some more time offline on that, but I'd say the quick answer is that we do expect obviously because of the elimination of bonus depreciation that you'll certainly get a bit more equitization from the parent down into the utility and so $300 million, I think it's a pretty good run rate from a financing perspective as to what you might expect going into the utility. And then we would also anticipate roughly a flat to maybe modestly declining equity ratio at the utility. But again we'd assume that 300 or so really of infusion is probably a pretty healthy and appropriate run rate of dollars that would go down into the [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Paul Ridzon : I've question relative to before tax reform. What is maybe looking five years out, what delta do you have in your rate base, absent any investment changes? Rejji Hayes : So you're saying absent tax reform and what specifically is the elimination, bonus depreciation and what that might do for rate base? Is that what you're implying just to make sure? Paul Ridzon : Yes. Rejji Hayes : Yes, so it's interesting. We have a fairly different rate construct in other and some rate constructs across the country. You'll see basically the deferred tax liability served as a deduct from rate base and so when you take reform obviously that's skinny [ph] and so you get a net increase in your rate base. As you may know in our rate construct deferred tax liability is a component of the rate making capital structure. And so it doesn't necessarily lead to a direct increase in rate base, but at the same time the economic effect is comparable because as you skinny [ph] that deferred tax liability in your rate making capital structure you'll offset it presumably with debt in equity. And so you have the effect of potential equity thickness overtime which leads to comparable economics, but don't view the elimination of bonus depreciation again in the context our rate construct as a net increase in rate base. But obviously because of the headroom created by tax reform it's going to create more headroom for capital investments and so we're increasing our five-year plan by about $1 billion so that will lead to higher rate base growth and what we initially pre-supposed. Paul Ridzon : Thank you and then switching to Slide 28, the dig slide. Just want to make sure I'm looking at this properly. It looks like there is a step down in 2018 is that just a hole to be filled. Is that the right way to look at that? Rejji Hayes : No, I just - I think what you saw in 2017 because we had as we see it some non-recurring benefits at dig. So obviously we have the layering strategy there that has gone well for us in the past and so we had nice capacity prices as well. We've been contracted for the long run on the energy side for a good while. But what we also saw and this is what I think with somewhat atypical because we had pretty good off peak margins merchant sales and so we do not expect that to resume going forward. Now in interest of full transparency and the context of Palisades transaction we did have about just over 400 megawatts of capacity sold to the utility as part of that transaction on a near term basis and so that did impact our layering strategy a little bit and so we're little open. So [indiscernible] about 30% for calendar year 2018 so there's a little bit of softness there, but at the end of the day I think most of that outperformance that you saw in 2017 versus what we're expecting in 2018 is really attributable to off-peak merchant sales which we don't expect recur. Paul Ridzon : In that 35 assumes a typical market price at that 30 [indiscernible]. Rejji Hayes : Well remember most of the portfolio is already sold, so we got 70% and we view as upside to plan as anything above $3 per kilowatt month and so you can assume that, good portion of the portfolio is already sold in excess of that and then we're assuming little bit softness on the amount, where we're open. Paul Ridzon : Got it. Patti Poppe : And as we look forward Paul, dig as always serves its role as the Tesla in the garage and as the state reliability mechanism and the local clearing requirement determinations are made by the commission that could be provide in the out years certainly dig as one of the few remaining sources of excess power available in the state, some real upside in the out years. So it has a lot of value to us, right where it sits. Paul Ridzon : That car just keeps changing, doesn't it. Patti Poppe : It's all electric baby, you can count on that. Paul Ridzon : And then lastly I think you're trying to do some upgrades to dig, can you just refresh us where that process stands? Rejji Hayes : So we had at one point contemplated some potential upgrades to dig and I would say, it wasn't in the near term it was more sort of beyond 2020, we've since reconsidered that and so we don't have any capital investments associated with that - baked into our plan and so you shouldn't assume that there is upside there. Paul Ridzon : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Patti for any closing remarks. Patti Poppe : Excellent and thanks for joining us everybody. Happy Valentine's Day. I hope you felt the love. We can't think of a better way to spend our time than with all of you. Rejji and I will be on the road in the coming weeks and month and I look forward to seeing you then. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

Analysts: Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Travis Miller - Morningstar Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CMS Energy 2018 First Quarter Results. The earnings news release issued early today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website, in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 PM Eastern Time running through May 3rd. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Srikanth Maddipati - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Patti. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Sri, and thank you, everyone for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. This morning, I'll share our strong first quarter financial and operating results, and review our regulatory calendar. Rejji will add more details on our financial results and outlook, and then we'll close with Q&A. We picked up right where we left off, at the end of last year where we're at, we are now delivering solid first quarter earnings of $0.86 per share, up 21% year-over-year or up 5% on a weather-normalized basis. The year-over-year comparison was largely driven by weather, given the unusually warm first quarter in 2017, as well as cost savings achieved already this year. Our solid start to the year gives us confidence in our ability to deliver the results you come to expect, regardless of weather or other changing conditions around us. Our strength is our agility and ability to flex. While it's early in the year, we continue to reaffirm our year-end guidance of 6% to 8% off of last year's actual results. And we reiterate that we'd be disappointed not to be towards the high end of our range again this year. Our focus and commitment to our triple bottom line people, planet and profit, underpinned by financial and operating performance is a low risk and sustainable business approach, and it continues to deliver. My story for this month starts at our Campbell Generating Station, I was able to join my co-workers as we celebrated a record run on Unit 3, prior to entering our planned periodic maintenance outage. We're proud of the maintenance work we've done and the environmental upgrades made over the years to protect the land, air and water for Michigan residents. We were excited to celebrate this record run, knowing that the power we generate at the Campbell plant is not only more reliable, but it's also cleaner than it's ever been. Yet, we are still dissatisfied. Longer term, we know that to reach our Clean Energy Breakthrough Goal that we announced in February, there will come a time when these plants will need to be retired. Some of these plants have served our customers for over 60 years. This decision has a real impact on the lives of the people and the communities surrounding our remaining plants, and my co-workers who are employed there. For that reason, like our handling of the Classic Seven retirements in 2016, we plan to work with these communities and our co-workers to ensure a smooth transition. Our previous coal retirements involved partnerships with developers to decommission these plants and then redevelop them for the good of the local community, which would all done at a lower cost for customers and perfectly exemplifies our triple bottom line. I'm excited to share some of the details of our Clean Energy Breakthrough Goal that we announced in February. As you know, we've already taken a leadership position in the sector by reducing our carbon emissions by 38% from 2005 with the closure of approximately 1 gigawatt of coal at our Classic Seven plants in 2016, which exceeds the requirements outlined by the Clean Power Plan. We've committed to cutting our carbon emissions by 80% and retiring all of our coal plants by 2040, which is a decade ahead of the targets in the Paris climate accord. In that timeframe, we anticipate that more than 40% of our energy will come from clean sources, such as wind and solar and from energy storage. Our goal doesn't end there. Over the next five years, we plan to save 1 billion gallons of water, reduce waste going to landfills by 35% and protect 5,000 acres of land in Michigan. These industry-leading results and commitments along with our social and governance practices have made us the number one U.S. utility in the Annual Sustainalytics Rankings for the second year in a row, all while continuing to deliver top tier financial results. On the regulatory front, you may recall that we filed our five-year electric distribution plan in the first quarter. We believe the five-year plan will provide a visible road map of our electric investments on needed infrastructure, and our upcoming electric rate filing in the second quarter will align nicely with that five-year plan. We received an order in our Electric Rate Case in late March, which authorized a 10% ROE, and a $66 million in revenue. We view this outcome as constructive and a confirmation of the robust design of Michigan's Regulatory Statute. We have one additional rate case yet to be determined this year. We expect an order in our Gas Rate Case at the end of August. As a reminder, we initially requested $178 million of rate relief and a 10.5% ROE, which excluded the impacts of tax reform. Just to walk you through the math, we've revised our request down by $33 million, largely related to cost savings already achieved, such as benefit savings, as well as capital and other O&M that were pushed beyond the test year. We're reducing our requests even further by including the impact of tax reform, which results in a revised request of $83 million, and reflects a 10.75% ROE, given the implications of tax reform and current economic conditions. Given tax reform and low commodity prices, this is a great opportunity to make significant safety and infrastructure upgrades to our system, while still protecting customers from bills they can't effort. Finally, in June, we plan to file our long awaited IRP. The new energy law requires us to file the IRP, which will provide more insight to our future generation (07:36), and allows the commission to go on the record with their view of our plan. The IRP will also provide investments certainty ahead of capital expenditures and will align with our clean and lean philosophy. We are at a unique moment in time. As we are retiring our traditional coal assets, and out of market PPAs, we have choices about how to replace that energy and capacity. We're opting to leverage this moment, and we don't plan to replace that capacity on a megawatt per megawatt basis right away. Instead, we'll primarily use a modular build out of renewable sources of power coupled with energy waste reduction through energy efficiency and demand response. Our incentive mechanism for energy efficiency and investment in renewables make these choices good for customers and for investors. This is the essence of our clean and lean investment philosophy, which allows us to eliminate energy waste, rightsize our energy supply and distribution system, and minimize exposure to high price PPAs, fuel, O&M and future stranded costs through big bets. We can then deploy that capital into renewable investments in other areas of the business that provide additional benefits to our customers, including electric distribution and gas infrastructure, which improves safety and reliability, while executing on our commitment to the planet. As we focus on the road ahead, it's important to note that we continue to deliver regardless of weather or any other external factors, just look at our track record. We provide consistent results supported by strong operations performance and no resets. Our agility and conservative planning are our strengths. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you, Patti and good morning, everyone. As Patti highlighted, we are pleased to report that we've kicked off 2018 with a strong first quarter, achieving earnings per share of $0.86, up $0.15 from the first quarter 2017, which implies 21% period-over-period growth, largely driven by weather and cost savings. Weather-normalized earnings were up 5% from the prior year, which reflects colder winter weather to the benefit of the gas business, and a lack of significant storm activity relative to Q1 of 2017. As a result of this strong start, we're ahead of plan, which is always helpful prior to storm season. That said, it is still early in the year, so we'll continue to plan conservatively and manage the business with a focus on executing on our capital plan and identifying cost savings to mitigate future risk to the plan and to perpetuate our self-funding strategy for the benefit of customers and investors. On slide 10, on the left hand side of the waterfall chart, you can see the favorable comparison of the first quarter 2018 results versus Q1 of 2017. Favorable weather provided $0.14 of positive variance and cost savings including reduced benefits, expenses and minimal storm activity contributed $0.07. Also, rate relief net of investments provided a $0.01 of EPS upside relative to the comparable period in 2017. These sources of positive variance were partially offset by lower non-weather sales, largely due to our energy efficiency program. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2018, we are encouraged by the path required to achieve our 2018 EPS guidance range, which includes modest pick up later in the year from our already approved electric rate increase, a constructive outcome in our pending gas case, and normal weather. However, as mentioned before, we'll continue to plan conservatively with a keen eye on risk mitigation, given the inherent variability that we have experienced in our business over the years. To that end, slide 11 best illustrates said variability, but more important highlights of resilience of our business model. During periods of unfavorable weather or other sources of downside, we rely on our ability to flex operating and non-operating levers to meet our financial objectives without compromising customer service. During strong periods, we focus on reinvestment into the business to achieve longer term benefits for customers and investors. Every year is different, but we always expect to meet our financial and operational objectives year-in and year-out. On slide 12, we highlight as a reminder, the model that facilitates our ability to deliver consistent industry-leading financial performance. With our extensive backlog of capital investments which drives earnings growth, significant cost reduction opportunities and a diverse economy in our service territory, we are confident that we can maintain our success for many years to come. The multifaceted nature of the self-funding strategy, which is comprised of cost reductions, tax planning, sales and non-utility earnings contribution facilitates risk mitigation. In fact, our ability to self-fund the vast majority of our capital investments enables us to meet our financial and operational targets, while minimizing the customer price impact every year. To elaborate on the magnitude of our organic growth opportunity, as noted on slide 13, that we have an extensive inventory of capital investment projects at the utility due to our large and aging electric and gas systems. As we have historically invested in our system at a measured pace given customer affordability constraints. As highlighted on our fourth quarter call, given the substantial rate reduction opportunity presented by tax reform in addition to the other aspects of our self-funding strategy, we have forecasted a five-year capital investment program of approximately $10 billion, which extends our runway for growth without compromising our annual price increase target of at or below inflation. The expected composition of this plan will be weighted towards improving our gas infrastructure, as well as upgrading our electric distribution system and investing in more renewable generation. This level investment further improves the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems to the benefit of customers, evolves our generation portfolio to the benefit of the planet, and extends the runway for EPS growth to the benefit of investors. Our capital investment needs remain significant beyond the five-year period as evidenced in the circular chart on the left. As we work through the aforementioned regulatory proceedings and our ordinary course financial planning cycle, we expect that the longer term capital mix will continue to evolve, and we look forward to providing an update on our 10-year capital plan in due time. As mentioned, our model is successful, because we largely self-fund our capital plans through cost savings to minimize customer bill impact. Now, historically, we have emphasized our substantial focus and achievements on reducing operation and maintenance expense, and rightfully I might add, since we have reduced those costs by 11% since 2013, we also foresee sustainable process improvements through waste elimination and Lean Principles embodied by the CE Way, which can lead to future savings within and beyond O&M. To that end, it is important to note that we do not discriminate when it comes to cost savings, and we view literally every component of our cost structure as an opportunity. In fact, the non-O&M portion of our cost structure represents a pool of approximately $4.5 billion, which is roughly 80% of our costs. Needless to say that pool won't go to zero, but it offers a significant cost savings opportunity, which creates headroom to invest capital to improve the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems, while minimizing customer bills. The expiration of our large PPAs will create substantial cost reduction opportunities in the future, and in the interim, we'll continue our efforts to reduce fuel and power supply cost, interest expense, and property and income taxes. As for the latter, over the course of the next several months, we'll provide bill credits to customers through a three-step process, which will ultimately equate to a rate reduction of up to 4%. I'll refer you to slide 21 in the appendix of our presentation for additional detail. And as noted in the past, every 1% reduction in customer rates equates to $400 million of incremental capital investment capacity. The benefits of our cost reduction efforts and financial discipline over the years are illustrated on the right hand side of the slide. As you'll note, residential electric and gas bills have declined relative to inflation over the past five years, despite the fact that we have invested approximately $8.5 billion in aggregate into those systems over that period. And we expect that trend of maintaining customer bills, at or below inflation while continuing to make substantial investments into the system to continue for the foreseeable future. Our capital investment program and self-funding strategy is complemented by an investment grade balance sheet, which is underpinned by solid cash flow generation and a conservative financing strategy. Our financial discipline has led to strong credit metrics in numerous ratings upgrades over the years as highlighted on slide 15. This prudent balance sheet management had enabled us to absorb the effects of tax reform, while extending our capital plan without issuing substantial amounts of equity. As a reminder, our FFO to debt ratio is projected to be approximately 18% by year-end, which includes the effects of federal tax reform and is in line with our targeted range. On slide 16, we've provided the sensitivities to our plan for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, upon receipt of the Electric Rate Case order in March, with no further electric order scheduled in 2018, we have struck that sensitivity for the balance of the year. So, suffice it to say with reasonable planning assumptions and robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. So we feel quite good about our ability to meet our financial targets this year. Slide 17 summarizes the low risk nature of our business mix, with significant utility earnings contribution coupled with largely contracted non-utility growth and prudent financial planning, we believe our historical success can be perpetuated in the long-term with no big bets. And with that, I would like to thank you again on behalf of CMS for joining us this morning, and I'll hand it back to Patti for some closing remarks. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Rejji. With our unique self-funding model enhanced by the Consumers Energy Way and tax reform, a constructive regulatory statute, a large and aging system in need of capital investments and a healthy balance sheet to fund our plan cost effectively, we believe our financial performance is sustainable over the long-term. With that, Francesca please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you all. Good morning. Congratulations on the results. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. So perhaps just first quick question here, with some preliminary guidance out of IRS on interest deductibility, how are you thinking about your relationship with EnerBank ultimately, I'll leave it broad here? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, I'll just start with \u2013 as we've always said, EnerBank is a small part of the big picture. It certainly provides a nice buffer in light of tax reform. Given that, however, we still think that in the long run EnerBank might have more value to someone else. And so we'll keep our eyes open, but while it's still in the family, we're going to definitely leverage it for its full potential, but again it's a small part of the total picture. But Rejji might want to touch on some of the tax benefits of EnerBank more specifically. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, I'd echo that Julien. I mean we have said for some time clearly it's a non-core business, but historically it has not provided any sort of drag on the consolidated return on equity of the business nor has it offered up a drag with respect to growth, and the business has been largely self-sufficient for some time now, and so we haven't equitize it for a while. So provided it continues to do that, we view it as a nice contributor to the total pie. And as mentioned in the context of tax reform, it does provide a shield, and we still believe that it does in light of the new bill. And so, we'll keep an eye on the IRS guidance, but at the end of the day we're fiduciaries, and at the right valuation we're certainly obligated to take a look at it as a potential disposition. But for now, we'll continue to leave it chugging along, and we'll continue to enjoy the tax shield that it creates. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. Just moving on to the latest MISO auction, if I'm reading between the lines a little bit, it seems like you're saying for DIG on 2018 guidance below $3 versus kind of roughly $3 before, I mean is that kind of an appropriate sort of teasing a part of your updated guidance here? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, I think that's fair, Julien. So, we have \u2013 as mentioned on the Q4 call, we had over 400 megawatts of capacity held up, effectively in escrow as part of the Palisades transaction, because one of the I'll say interim or short-term buyer replacement plans as a part of that transaction was to sell a capacity to the utility. And so while that 400 or so megawatts was held in abeyance, we missed a pretty good opportunity to sell down that capacities we often like to do in advance. And so we were left with a significant amount of open capacity in 2018. The economic impact is de minimis, and we were able to offload a good portion of that in the auction. But obviously at $0.30 a kilowatt month which is where the auction ended up, that wasn't in line with our plan. So there was a little bit of downside associated with that, but again the impact on 2018 is de minimis. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: And I'll just add that we had made some upgrades at the plant at DIG, and that has turned out to be a nice offset. We're actually getting a couple additional megawatts that's above plan, and so that's been a nice offset. So all-in-all, enterprise is in line with plan for the year. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, and the other point I would add is that, obviously given its unregulated status, the tax savings associated with federal tax reform, they get to keep on that side of the business. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. But ultimately, you wouldn't necessarily say that it's \u2013 that bilateral pricing has come off, meaningfully as we kind of think beyond 2018 here? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: No, I don't think the market has softened all that much, and in fact, we've said in the past, the context of the state reliability mechanism process and the charge that was established by the commission last year, I think we'll get visibility probably in the next few months as to whether or not there'll be a local clearing requirement beyond 2021. And so, that to me should materially tighten the bilateral market in which case there could be significant opportunities in the capacity side for DIG. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. And then, lastly the \u2013 basically the cost savings year-to-date, I think it's like $0.06 to $0.02, it's basically to say that you've got some room in the plan to hit the numbers, basically is that kind of a fair way to describe that, as you think about that waterfall through the year? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. That's right. I mean that last column or that last component of the chart has always effectively been the plug. And if you look at the opportunities we have within our plan, if you look at some of the activities that we've moved forward on in Q4, some of the reinvestment opportunities, the bond tender, those what I'll call discretionary activities, needless to say, we don't need to move forward on those this year, so we feel like we have a lot of optionality going into the last three quarters of the year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Well, thank you all. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you, Julien. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Julien. Operator : Next question is from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, good morning, guys. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Michael. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Michael. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, can you discuss how the state reliability mechanism is kicking in at this point, and what impact that might have or it might be having already on collection of revenues for future capacity? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: So, right now, we had to declare what our ability to serve our own load was, which we did back in December of 2016, and then in February, the AESs had indicate their ability to serve, and at this time it looks like they are able to serve their load, and so the state reliability mechanism is fulfilled. Sorry, we \u2013 in 2017 we declared our ability to serve our load. But, bottom line the AESs have demonstrated that they can serve their load and we have a capacity charge then that is assigned to customers, only in the event that they cannot. And so that's not yet materialized. But we expect that given the local clearing requirements that will be established later this year, that will be what forces, I think, more transparency about local load being provided to serve AES customers. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: And Michael, this is Rejji, just to be clear here, I think you may have described it as a revenue opportunity, if I heard you correctly. Needless to say, in the event you do have a situation in which these alternative electric suppliers and the choice customers that they have do not demonstrate that they have the requisite capacity going forward, and they are in fact levied a charge that they would pay back to us, that would go directly to customers. So that's really \u2013 we don't view it as an upside opportunity from the utility per se, but obviously it's a cost savings related opportunity which can create headroom. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, we think of it as more accurately reflecting cost of service, and cost allocation, if you will, to the appropriate parties who are utilizing the energy should be paying for it. And so, it's a cost savings for customers. But as Rejji articulated, it's not a definitely revenue upside if you will. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I see, sothose revenues really are just \u2013 it's the pressure on the customers to go ahead and do something about choosing some kind of capacity requirement, right -or capacity contract? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Correct. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Not really \u2013 yeah. And just one last question. Just to clarify on EnerBank, you're still offsetting the parent interest expense, right, with the interest income there. Are you saying that might not be necessary, and that's why it's being considered for a possible disposition at this point? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: No, no. There's certainly value that we ascribe to that tax shield, but we're just saying as a non-core asset, and as fiduciaries if there is a third-party that has an interest in buying the property we would have to evaluate it. And so we believe that that tax shield is certainly of a great value and it does provide a nice shield to the interest expense to the parent. But as a fiduciary, if somebody comes along with the right price, we have to have a discussion. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: So, it's probably fair to say that its value did increase given its role that it plays for the company. And so, certainly, we'll leverage that until there's a better offer. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Very good. It's fair to say that you're getting inbound calls from it or \u2013 at this point? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: We don't discuss M&A opportunities. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you. Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Shar. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hey Shar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Could we just real quick touch on stakeholder feedback so far that you're getting around the five-year distribution plan. How's dialog going? But really more importantly, could we touch on the timing and scope for a rider or tracker request? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Sure. A couple of things, first of all on stakeholder engagement we've had I would say a great amount of discussions, and it's been really good for us to have conversations with key environmental interveners, customer groups, customer types, as well as policymakers on both our distribution and our Integrated Resource Plan, that involvement from stakeholders, I think goes a long way to having positive outcomes of regulatory filings. Now, keep in mind that distribution plan, actually doesn't result in any kind of order if you will accepting the plan, it just creates transparency to the plan. And so the stakeholder involvement, I think just bodes well to say that we have thought of everything, and we're considering all the appropriate alternatives for our investments in the distribution system as well as the IRP. And the IRP, we're excited to publish that, we'll publish that in June. It will provide a great integrated look between the electric distribution and the supply plan. And so we look forward to getting those documents public, and that will them provide an opportunity \u2013 a window into really what the capital plan is more specifically on the distribution side. One other clarification on the IRP itself, it's going to be a 20-year look, but the first three years of it are really what provides some of the economic certainty for investments in the first three years of the IRP. So, it's obviously been a busy regulatory season for our regulators, and their staff, a nod to them all the hard work they've been doing to implement the 2016 Energy Law. It's been a heavy lift, but I think what we're putting in place then provides the framework for potentially tracking mechanisms, because you've got multiple years of look of an investment strategy. But, even without tracking mechanisms, I think it provides some more visibility and alignment around the infrastructure investment upgrades required in Michigan. I'll just add one last thought here that the amount of investment magnitude is driven by our aging system. And so, as we've reiterated multiple times, it's not a shortage of investments, it's just deciding the best investments. So, these proceedings really do provide an opportunity to align and have more regulatory certainty going into the filings. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. And is there any specific timing we should think about as far as a tracker request? What would be the right (29:53)? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Those were always hard \u2013 yeah, it will be part of any of our rate case filings. So, we have one tracking mechanism in our gas system right now for Enhanced Infrastructure Replacement Program, that's our mains and our service lines, we're looking at increasing that, we've got a current Gas Rate Case, it's under review right now, that expands it even further. We received an expansion of that tracking mechanism in our last order. So, we think we're developing a good track record of doing what we say we're going to do, and that's important when establishing a pattern for approval for these tracking mechanisms. So, in a gas case, we'd look for additional components to be included in that specific tracking mechanism or a parallel one for example on vintage services. And then, on the electric system, we would expect in our Electric Rate Case to file for a tracking mechanism that would align for example with that five-year electric distribution plan, and that would be resolved through a final order on that rate case. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay, perfect answer. And then... Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: So, we plan to file that rate case in second quarter. So, that's a 10 months from the filing date. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay, perfect. And then just one last question. Just thinking more long term on the back end of your 10-year plan, and potential upside around capital programs in the IRP and replacing above market PPAs. How should we sort of think about more specifically around renewables, mainly are you seeing sort of a same strong wind economics is one of your Michigan peers. And is there any sort of opportunities pull forward more of that spend, maybe because of incremental customer demand for it? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, you bet. In fact, we've already done some of that. We actually have the green renewable tariff approved and fully subscribed for our largest customers to have access to additional renewables, our Cross Winds, wind park, one of our expansions was dedicated to that tariff and serving load beyond our renewable portfolio standard. We are obviously also working to achieve the 15% renewable portfolio standard that was part of the 2016 Energy Law, and that will be about 500 additional megawatts, we have about $700 million in our plan to achieve that additional renewables. And then any of the incremental renewables either to fulfill our IRP or to serve additional C&I, specifically the industrial customers who have renewable energy targets, will be incremental to that. And so, again our IRP that we're going to file in June will be very reflective of what we see as that plan going forward, and renewable energy plays a very, very important part of our future. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: And Shar, this is Rejji, just to provide some additional context around the magnitude of the potential, I'd say a supply replacement opportunity, we have \u2013 as we've highlighted about 4 gigawatts of power coming offline over the next two decades. So, if you look at the 2040 you've got Palisades, in the next decade, you got MCV, those two alone are 2 gigawatts... Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Correct. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: ...if you look at. The coal units, that's another 2 gigawatts up to 2040, and so as we rolled out our Clean Energy Breakthrough Goal, we did highlight that if you did backfill a good portion of that energy and capacity with renewable, it could be up to about 40% of our fleet over time. And so, you think about the magnitude and size of that potential opportunity, it really is quite robust, and we're seeing \u2013 continue to see attractive capacity factors, we talked about the opportunities we've got in the context of RFP, and we're seeing capacity factors in the high-30s, which implies kind of mid-40s on a megawatt hour basis. And so we think Michigan and renewable opportunities here will continue to be competitive, and we think the cost curve will continue to trend in the right way. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, particularly as we look at the 10-year, 15-year plan, solar will play an increasing role, because we expect prices to continue to drop for solar just as technology advances plus its capacity factor at peak is like 50%. And so we can play a really important role in planning for capacity for the future. So, again our IRP, I think will be very reflective of the plan, and so we look forward to making that public in June. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Terrific, guys. That's all I had. Congrats on the results. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Shar. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Shar. Operator : The next question comes from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi guys. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Praful. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hey, good morning. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. So just staying on the EnerBank theme for a minute. You've talked about non-core asset, but wanted to understand, if there is an opportunity to sell, is there a tax bases or tax leakage that you see on this kind of transaction, would this be like a cash sale. And if it were a cash sale, what kind of tax leakage do you see in such a transaction? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: It's just a function as I see it, Praful, as the timing of a transaction, so we've owned the business for some time. So you can assume that basis is low. But remember, we're not scheduled to be a federal tax payer until the early 2020s. And so in the event it was a \u2013 it were a sale \u2013 if a sale or disposition were to take place in the near-term, you can assume you get a deferral on that gain for a few years, if there is \u2013 if it's to take place, say five, six years from now, you can assume there will be economic leakage. But needless to say, we would take all of that into account in the context of a potential transaction. And I don't want to set expectations too much. I mean, we're going to be thoughtful about this, the business contributes quite a bit, and obviously it has an enhanced strategic value in the context of tax reform. And so, we would take all of that into account if any inbounds were to occur, and again we won't talk about whether there are any M&A opportunities in play. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Fair enough. That's helpful. And then slide 17 is full too. Just wanted to understand on that, the parent growth rate where you have plus to minus 1%, I guess. Just wanted to understand what are the factors that could drive it both upwards and downwards from the midpoint? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, so embedded in that, I'll call it just corporate bucket, you have EnerBank within that. And so EnerBank is a component of that, you've got interest expense at the parent, which is non-recoverable. And so in the event you get economic refinancing opportunities, that could drive some potential upside there. And so it's a combination of EnerBank, interest expense, savings, those are really the core drivers as I see it. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks. And then finally just, I know, you didn't want to talk M&A, but just broader corporate M&A. I don't know if you want to touch on that, given your strong financial position right now; is there more activity you see in terms of conversations around broad corporate M&A, and how would you see yourselves both as buyers and sellers right now? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: You know our plan has so much organic potential, we really are not looking at M&A as a necessary part of our planning. We feel great about our plan. And if somebody \u2013 again as fiduciaries if a great offer came to us, it would have to be a great offer, because our plan is solid, and we feel good about the direction that we're taking. So certainly not on the front page of any of our planning is \u2013 M&A does not play a front page role of any of our planning. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: And Praful, this is Rejji. Just to circle back to your prior question about opportunities or the key drivers within the sort of corporate bucket, I would be remiss, particularly if I spend a lot of time with our head of tax to not mention the good work we've done on the tax planning side over the years, and so that also is a key driver of the corporate business. So, I would say tax planning, interest expense as well as the EnerBank contribution, those are all material drivers of the performance of that segment. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. Great. Thanks, guys. All super helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller - Morningstar: Good morning. Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hey, morning, Travis. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning. Travis Miller - Morningstar: Hi. Just a quick clarification. On that cost savings at $0.07, was that more pull forward or was that more overachieving or \u2013 and achieving in line? Just clarify that cost savings number relative to the rest of the year? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, I would say a small portion of it it's a pull-forward. So, we did a bond or a partial bond take out in Q4 of last year. We had some 8.75% senior notes, where it's a $300 million tranche, we took out two-thirds of it, and so that led to some savings. Obviously, you could do a little better than 8.75% in this market. So that was a small source of savings. The biggest component of it that was relative or was related I should say to benefits related savings, and that was due to changes we made in both our OPEB and pension plans which led to real cash and significant pension-related savings that we were delighted to pass onto the customers in our pending gas case, and so that's really the primary source. It's a combination of benefits and interest expense savings. Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. And those were part of your plan? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: So, they were not embedded in the plan at least in terms of the interest expense savings, so that created some upside. And then the pension, I would say, yeah, largely that was accounted for. So, don't believe that that's going to be a significant tailwind for what we deliver at the end of the year, if that's what you're thinking. Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. Okay. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: And keep in mind our model is all about deploying cost savings, finding them, implementing them, achieving them, and then redeploying operating and maintenance dollars back into the business to prepare for next year. So, when we are doing planning, we are looking at execution this year for sure, but we're also looking about execution in 2019, and building a plan and reinvesting those O&M dollars back into the business for the benefit of more predictable outcomes at the end of this year and next year, which is what really is our strength, our ability to flex throughout a year, put to work those cost savings to the benefits of \u2013 to the benefit of customers and investors. That's what makes us so predictable year after year after year after year. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: And Travis, sorry just to clarify, so both the interest expense savings as well as the benefit savings were embedded in our 2018 plan, but I was thinking about in the context of relative to the comp of Q1 of 2017, they create positive variance, because they weren't in [Technical Difficulty] (41:01) 2017. So, I just want to be perfectly clear about that. Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. Okay. Great. And then on longer term where does energy storage play a role? Either in what we'll see in IRP or just in your plan already? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, I think you'll see energy storage also as a part of our IRP. We've been doing work to learn more. We've got some demonstration pilots, we had an opportunity to visit with Tesla and Stamm (41:27) out in California on a benchmarking and learning trip, if you will. We see the opportunity for storage to fit into the plan nicely. Now, it's not economic today, but we think that those cost curves will continue to occur, and we think there are places both on the grid side and in residential applications for storage to play an important piece in maximizing the dispatchability of renewables, as well as providing more control and options on the grid. So, we're excited about that technology. But like all things, we're not making any big bets, we're not going long in new untested technology, we'll do our homework and apply it appropriately. Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hey, good morning, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Slide 10 on the waterfall, just the first quarter negative $0.07, one of the drivers there is cited as economy, can you just touch on that? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, sure. It's interesting. On the surface, if you look at the supporting slides or pages that we provide publicly, you'll see across electric we saw a little bit of softness, at least in the data around residential, commercial and industrial sales trends. And so just to give some specifics on that, residential was down between 1% to 1.5%; commercial down 1% to 1.5% and this is on a weather-normalized basis and net of energy efficiency, and then industrial was down about 3%. And so all of that was, again, on the surface a bit surprising, because we still see very good economic conditions within the state, particularly in the heart of our service territory. So, we're probing that. But I think over time, if you look back at our history, if past is prologue, we never get too excited good or bad about Q1, because it certainly is not indicative of the full year. So, just to go back to recent memory last year, in Q1 of 2017, we started out of the gate at about 1% to 1.5% up, we ended the year just under 0.5%. In 2016, we started the year out flat, and then ended up at about 0.5%. And so, Q1 does not a year make, but I'll also just point you to the EPS curve that we've highlighted in the past, it just shows the inherent variability in the business. And so, we never rely upon one driver to help us deliver our financial performance. And so, sales is a sort of one small component of the self-funding strategy. And we usually overachieve on the cost side, as well as some of the other drivers or levers to manage the work and make sure we deliver. The only other thing I'd mention again, because it's to me a little surprising, we did really peel the onion on just these data points I highlighted around commercial, residential, and industrial performance, and cycle billed sales in our service territory for the quarter were actually up quite a bit. And so, I'll just quote for you a couple of sectors that we dug into. As you know our service territory is pretty well-diversified. And so, we saw chemicals up 6%, fabricated metal products up 2%, we saw also transportation equipment up 5%, and then food manufacturing up 13%, and this is Q1 of 2018 versus Q1 of 2017. We have again many sectors within our service territory, but I'm not cherry-picking here, those are the most energy-intensive sectors within our service territory. And so, we actually think that suggests that there's actually a pretty good underlying economic story within our service territory. And the last two, transportation equipment as well as food manufacturing are actually pretty good leading indicators, because that suggests both for transportation equipment that the industrial side of the state is doing pretty well. And then with respect to food manufacturing, that usually suggests that commercial, retail activity, diners, restaurants, grocery stores are all still humming along. And so, again, I don't think it really tells the full story, but that's the data that we have at the moment. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: As I recall \u2013 I mean you had an extremely mild quarter last year and you showed outsized strength on the economy. Is this just the weather norm model breaking down on extremes? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, so that's an imperfect science, as you know, and so given that it was an incredibly mild winter from a weather perspective in Q1 of 2017, I also \u2013 we're going to have to dig in a bit more into that Q1 2017 comp, because I do think the weather normalization trends may also be leading to a little bit of the vagaries in the math we're seeing right now, because I do not believe that the statistics that I read off around residential, commercial and industrial performance in Q1 are indicative of what we're seeing again economically in the state. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then, obviously Governor Snyder is termed out, any candidates out there leaning towards energy as a policy to platform on? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, Paul, I don't see them leaning toward energy as a key issue, because of the law that was passed in 2016. I think a lot of \u2013 all of the candidates are aware and were in some cases involved in the passage of that law. And so I think, there's a lot of people who with a strong point of view that it's a good construct, it's a good statute that was passed with bipartisan support. And so to tackle that again it would be a big issue. But I will say all the leading candidates have good track records, and we as you know have always worked with whoever is in office to make sure that we're serving Michigan well. And so no worry be it on the election front. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : The next question is from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. So, I hate to go back to the Bank question, but so is the Bank a big contributor to your operating cash flows? I mean, I understand the earnings impact, but given the tax reform, I would have thought that this is actually a pretty important asset, because it's likely supporting your cash flows now? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Not a material one. So, we generally get a run rate of about call it $45 million to $50 million pre-tax from that business. And so if you tax effect that, that gives you a pretty good proxy for the cash flow generation. We did $1.7 billion of operating cash flow last year, and the target this year is $1.65 billion. So, it's not a material contributor from an OCF perspective. And again, it's a self-funding model, and so we're not equitizing that business, we're not getting dividends out of that business. And so, at the end of the day we don't rely on it for any of our liquidity needs. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: And remember it's an industrial loan corporation, so it doesn't have deposits if you will, it's \u2013 it does loans for home improvements. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Changing topics to the renewables, and growing investments in renewables. So, I mean initially to be honest, I thought that if you continue to add especially wind to your systems, then you will run your coal plants or gas plants less, and that will actually help your O&M expenses. But the more we're looking at it, it seems like the cycling of the conventional power assets actually increases O&M expenses, at least initially unless the addition of a wind farm coincides with over time and over coal plant. Is this a fair assessment? And also you know that you've always managed to beat all of your expectations regarding O&M efficiencies, but does it make it more difficult for you to hit your O&M target as you increase your renewable power penetration? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: I think it's a great question. The coal plants in particular were not designed for cycling. So the things that you observe are true, but there's an interesting asset in our Ludington Pumped Storage, which is basically the fourth largest battery in the world, it's a pump storage that allows for dispatching at peak times. And so it serves as a great complement to our renewable assets. And so that configuration for us combined at consumers are gas plants, really do, I'd say perform very well in concert with renewables, and therefore the O&M expenses associated with the gas plant and the Ludington Pumped Storage plant combined with renewables is actually quite favorable for our operating system. Now, I will \u2013 I agree that coal is harder to cycle like that which is why we retired a 1 gigawatt of coal, and is good economically and good for the planet. So, that definitely improves our operating expense profile with the transition to more renewables in that way. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Patti Poppe for any closing remarks. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, thank you everybody. Great, questions today, it was good to be with you. We look forward to seeing you at our upcoming events, and for those of you who will be at AGA, we'll be happy to see you there as well. Thanks so much. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

I would like to take a moment before turning the call over to Patti to congratulate Phil on his retirement. Phil served as a steady hand in the IR department for 22 years, and we have all been fortunate to know and work with him. Phil, thank you for your dedication to the company. We're sad to see you go, but it's a well-deserved retirement. Taking Phil's place will be Travis Uphaus, our new Director of Investor Relations. Many of you know Travis well and you can expect to continue communicating with me and Travis going forward. Now, I'll turn the call over to Patti. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Sri. Phil's been a great contributor to our company's success and he will be greatly missed. Frankly, we haven't had enough of Phil just yet. So later tonight, we're throwing him a surprise party. If you're listening in, Phil, and we know you are, bring your dancing shoes and we'll bring the Motown. Now, back to business. During this morning's call, I'll cover our financial results for the first half and recap the recently filed Integrated Resource Plan among other updates, and Rejji will provide more details on our financial results and outlook for the year. We continue to deliver solid results for the first six months of this year. Our adjusted earnings per share for the first half are $1.34 and that's up 29% from the prior year. We continue to guide toward a full year range of $2.30 to $2.34. We'd be disappointed if we didn't deliver it towards the high end of that guidance again this year, giving us our 16th year of consistent industry-leading financial performance. Longer term, we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver the consistent results on which you've come to rely. We're reiterating our long-term guidance of 6% to 8% annual adjusted EPS growth and we continue to expect our dividend growth to align with earnings growth. Our focus and commitment to our triple bottom line of people, planet and profit underpinned by financial and operating performance is a sustainable and low risk business approach that continues to deliver for you our investors and our customers. In fact, Market Strategies International recently named Consumers Energy as the most trusted brand in the Midwest for business customers. Our entire capital plan is designed with the triple bottom line in mind. For example, we currently have a gas pipeline project going on near Grand Rapids. The project itself will deliver additional capacity to help match the economic growth we're seeing in the heart of our service territory. It's really exciting. In fact, we're giving our board members a walking tour of this $47 million project next week to demonstrate the triple bottom line firsthand. As many of you know, there's no place I would rather be than out in the field with my team, with my hard hat and my boots on. We're utilizing our own employees to do the work because we have the foresight to create a seasonal work crew for our Main Replacement Program and projects like this one. With the labor market tightening, this has actually proven to be a real competitive advantage for us. The environmental soundness of the project through our modern water reclamation process is reducing waste and saving money. In fact, we anticipate saving millions of gallons of water and millions of dollars on this project alone. From a safe distance, our board of directors and our team will watch along Interstate 96 as our team boards beneath the lanes of traffic and I can assure you there will be nothing boring about that. The passage of the 2016 energy law provided us an opportunity to file a long-term generation plan. This key element of Michigan's legislative framework is forward-looking and enables us and the commission to align our long-term generation planning, providing greater certainty as we invest to transform Michigan's energy future. We're the first utility to file and our team has spent the better part of the year assembling our Integrated Resource Plan with the triple bottom line in mind. This plan follows our clean and lean generation strategy, which uses modular renewables and demand side resources to closely match supply with demand and avoid big bets. What we love about our approach is that it's flexible. We are required by statute to file an updated IRP every five years and are allowed to do it sooner as the business environment changes and technologies evolve. At the same time, the financial approval portion of the statute gives three years of certainty in our supply investments. Since we don't have any big bets and given the timing of our planned retirements, we're able to space out investments allowing us to build a more modular generation fleet and a smoother investment plan. The use of demand response and energy efficiency plays a prominent role in our near-term capacity planning and the 2016 energy law enables incentives for implementing these resources. It highlights the strength of Michigan's regulatory construct, which is directed by very strong legislation. From a timing perspective, the Commission will comment on our IRP within 10 months and then we'll have 60 days to address any feedback before a final order is issued. Because the IRP results in pre-approval of capital expenditures in the first three years, future IRPs with larger supply investment plans will provide more forward-looking certainty. As I noted, the IRP has very little near-term impact to our five-year $10 billion capital plan. As we look beyond five years, there are $3 billion of potential capital investment opportunities, primarily for solar included in the IRP. However, the majority of our electric system investments, whether it be the next 5 years, 10 years or beyond, are focused on our distribution system. When you include our gas system needed investment, it yields at least $50 billion of system-wide opportunity. Our customers trust us to make prudent decisions to provide safe and reliable energy delivery. Our biggest constraint is balancing the needs of the system with customers' ability to pay. We wake up every day focused on tackling debt balance by relentlessly pursuing waste elimination and cost reduction in all areas of our business which Rejji will discuss in more detail. Our IRP reflects a plan that exceeds our already announced clean energy breakthrough goals from earlier this year by reducing carbon emissions by over 90%. Over time, we'll focus on cleaner supply sources as we retire our remaining coal units and replace the Palisades and MCV PPAs with the build-out of modular renewables. Ultimately, more than 40% of our supply mix will come from cleaner renewable sources. Through these great efforts, my coworkers make me proud and remind me why we are ranked the number one U.S. utility by Sustainalytics for the past few years in a row. To continue to achieve these goals and accomplishments, we know we have to walk the talk. In the second quarter of this year, we secured the purchase of Gratiot Farms Wind development for consumers. Once we complete construction in 2020, the project will add 150 megawatts of wind to our portfolio at the utility. We're doing more work at the utility to expand our renewable portfolio and support our customers' renewable efforts with our renewable tariffs. This program allows our large industrial customers to receive the renewable energy that they are demanding at competitive and affordable prices, while remaining fully bundled customers, no cost shift. We're delighted to help our customers like Switch and General Motors receive cleaner fuel sources as we devote about 70% of the energy from our cross-wind to wind farm to the program. Beyond the utility, we're expanding our renewable portfolio at enterprises with a 15-year wind PPA with General Motors based in Ohio. This wind farm adds another 105 megawatts of clean power to our enterprises mix that will consist of zero coal by 2020 at the completion of the Filer City conversions to natural gas. We're pleased to highlight all of this great work we're doing at all levels of the business. Not only is it better for the environment, but we're supporting our triple bottom line by investing in customer-driven low risk opportunities. Our growth will continue to be driven by our utility which has a robust backlog of needed system upgrades on both the gas and electric distribution systems. We have a solid portfolio of investments and our plan continues to be de-risked with forward-looking filings that enable alignment around strategic investments in the future and provide optionality across the business. We'll continue to operate our existing enterprises fleet efficiently and take advantage of opportunities like we saw with the recent wind PPA where we can serve valued customers like GM and invest in projects with similar risk-adjusted returns as the utility. When we couple our utility earnings contribution with contracted non-utility growth and prudent financial planning, I think, you can see why we have confidence in our ability to continue to grow at 6% to 8% in the long-term. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji to cover our first half results in detail. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into the financials, I would also like to extend my gratitude to Phil for his wonderful service to our Investor Relations efforts over the past two decades plus. Phil, you'll certainly be missed and we hope you enjoy your well-deserved retirement. As Patti mentioned, we're pleased to announce our strong results for the first half of 2018 with adjusted earnings per share of $1.34, up 29% from the comparable period in 2017, mostly attributable to weather and cost savings. On a weather normalized basis, earnings per share for the first half were up 5% versus the first half of 2017. For the second quarter, we had adjusted EPS of $0.48 which compares favorably to the $0.33 per share that we delivered in the second quarter of 2017. It is also worth noting that our adjusted earnings per share information for the quarter and year-to-date differs modestly from our GAAP earnings per share data given the exclusion of a $0.01 per share gain realized during the second quarter to the expiration of an indemnity obligation associated with a sale in 2007. Although we're proud of these results, we're only midway through the year, so we'll continue to plan conservatively and manage the business with a focus on executing on our operating plan and identifying cost savings to mitigate future risk to plan and to perpetuate our self-funding strategy to the benefit of customers and investors. On our waterfall chart on slide 12, you can see the favorable comparison of our 2018 year-to-date results versus the first half of 2017. Favorable weather provided $0.28 of positive variance with two-thirds of that coming from mild weather experienced in the first half of 2017. And cost savings contributed $0.10, primarily from reduced benefits expenses and lower storm or service restoration costs. Also rate relief net of investments provided $0.04 of contribution to the EPS upside relative to the comparable period in 2017. These sources of positive variance were partially offset by lower non-weather electric and gas usage, largely driven by the successful implementation of our numerous energy efficiency programs. As we look ahead to the second half of 2018, we remain cautiously optimistic about the glide path required to achieve our 2018 EPS guidance range of $2.30 to $2.34. This includes normal weather in the second half of the year, modest pickup from our already approved electric rate increase and a constructive outcome in our pending gas case. Given the weather and cost performance related tailwinds we have experienced in the first six months of the year, we'll be focused on identifying and implementing operational pull heads and other reinvestment opportunities to mitigate longer term risks. Slide 13 serves as a good example of the variability that we can experience in any given year and more importantly highlights the sustainability of our business model. As a reminder, we reinvest in the business during strong periods to de-risk future years and to perpetuate our consistent industry-leading financial performance. At this point six months into 2018, we are currently $0.16 ahead of plan that we will look to pull ahead reliability improvement programs such as forestry and plant maintenance from an operational perspective and we're always scouring the balance sheet for sources of non-operating savings as evidenced by the early extinguishment of the remaining portion of our 8.75% new notes apparent in June. Conversely, during periods of mild weather, heavy storm activity and/or other vagaries we manage to work and reduce operating and non-operating costs to meet our financial objectives without compromising customer service. In either scenario, both our customers and investors do well. This approach is supported by our simple but unique business model depicted on slide 14 which enables us to deliver consistent industry-leading financial performance year-in and year-out. We have a robust backlog of capital investments which improves the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems or customers and drives earnings growth for our investors. We fund this growth largely through cost cutting, tax planning, economic development and non-utility contribution, all efforts which we deem sustainable in the long run. As such, we are confident that we can continue to improve the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems through capital investments while meeting our customer affordability and environmental targets for many years to come. We're often asked whether we can sustain our track record of cost cutting given that we have already reduced our O&M cost by 11% since 2013 and also because it drives roughly half of our self-funding strategy. In response, I think slide 15 best illustrates our opportunities for future cost reductions. To provide some perspective, our cost structure is about $5 billion excluding depreciation, of which over 50% is represented by power and gas supply costs. Within these costs, we have numerous off-market power purchase agreements, two of which will offer material cost reduction opportunities within the next 10 years. In the near-term, our Palisades PPA is scheduled to terminate in 2022, which will replace with a cost efficient blend of demand and supply side resources as Patti noted. And in 2025, we'll have the contractual option to extend our MCV PPA at a materially lower price until 2030 as per recently filed Integrated Resource Plan. With fairly conservative assumptions, these actions alone would generate approximately $160 million of annual cost savings over time, which equate to about a 3% rate reduction. As a reminder, every 1% reduction in customer rates generates about $400 million of incremental capital investment capacity. Further, we expect recurring savings in fuel costs and O&M as we retire our coal fleet over time, most notably Karn 1 and 2 in 2023. Our power supply related savings will be supplemented with continued gas and electric system upgrades, which reduce service restoration and leak repair expenses among other benefits, our continued efforts on waste elimination through the CE Way and good business decisions of the past, such as our smart meter installation and attrition management, to name a couple. Lastly, we will continue to seek out non-operating savings through opportunistic re-financings, tax planning or otherwise to meet our financial objectives. To that end, in July, we implemented a $49 million credit to our gas customers as part of federal tax reform, which reduced the rates by 3% on an annual basis. On August 1, we will implement a $113 million credit at the electric utility. These estimates are in line with our plan and create headroom for future capital investments for the benefit of customers and investors. The fruits of our cost reduction efforts and financial discipline over the years are illustrated on the right-hand side of the slide with both our residential electric and gas bills declined relative to inflation over the past five years, despite approximately $8.5 billion of cumulative spend in those systems over that period. As we work hard to cut cost to fuel the self-funding strategy, we're also benefiting from solid economic conditions in our service territory. In fact, Grand Rapids and its surrounding areas, which represent Michigan's second largest population center behind Detroit and make it the heart of our electric service territory have experienced roughly double the building permit and GDP growth of the U.S. among other attractive economic factors as you'll note on slide 16. Year-to-date, we continue to see healthy weather normalized cycle build sales and food manufacturing, fabricated metal products and transportation equipment, three of the most energy-intensive sectors in our service territory. We've also done our share to generate economic development opportunities in Michigan, achieving roughly 70 megawatts of new business in 2017 and targeting 100 megawatts in 2018. A notable example is Amazon's recent decision to open the new fulfillment center in Grand Rapids. This win will add $150 million of private investment to the area and a 1,000 new jobs in Michigan. By actively sourcing incremental load growth opportunities, we can spread our cost over a wider volume of usage, which further reduces rates for customers. Looking now to our cash flows on slide 17, we anticipate some potential upside in operating cash flow in 2018 due to the prescribed pace at which the benefits of federal tax reform are being incorporated into rates. We continue to target $1.65 billion of OCF this year, but we may overachieve largely due to timing. So, when we combine this year and next, we don't see a material change, the aggregate cash flow generated of about $3.3 billion and still anticipate a $100 million per annum increase beginning in 2020. Our strong and predictable cash flow generation supports the investment grade balance sheets of the parent and the utility which is underpinned by conservative financing strategy. Our financial discipline as well as credit supportive policies in the state legislature and the commission has led to strong credit metrics and numerous ratings upgrades over the years. To that end, both Moody's and Fitch recently reaffirmed the solid investment grade ratings of the utility as part of their annual reviews. As a reminder, our FFO to debt ratio is projected to be approximately 18% by yearend, which includes the effects of federal tax reform and is in line with our targeted range. As we look ahead, we believe the strength of our balance sheet coupled with our self-funding strategy will enable us to prolong our success for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Patti for some closing remarks and then Q&A. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Rejji. To summarize, our investment thesis is driven by a large and aging system in need of capital investments, a growing and diverse territory, the constructive regulatory statute, a unique self-funding model that's enhanced by the CE Way and tax reform and a healthy balance sheet to fund our planned cost effectively. We are confident in our ability to deliver consistent industry-leading growth and superior total shareholder return over the long-term. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you very much, Patti. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. And today's first question comes from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First of all, congratulations, Phil. It's been a pleasure working with you. And Patti, I don't think you're supposed to tell him about the surprise party 12 hours early, but I'll let you run your business as you see fit. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil : My first question... Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: I think it was planned, yeah. Thank you. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil : My first question, weather adjusted volumes have been a little soft year-to-date. Obviously, it's very hard to weather normalize the extremes we've had both years. So my real question is about energy efficiency. How should we think about the impact going forward? You mentioned in this slide that the incentive will be rising, your financial incentives, but how should we think about the impact on volumetric growth. And then as a related question, if you're able to give any detail on numbers around potential incentives for demand response? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Great questions, Andrew. Thank you. We do expect energy efficiency to continue to grow. We are at about 1.5% annually, we're going to 2% and we clearly identify that in the IRP. It is a key part of understanding our clean and lean strategy, reducing that energy waste is an important opportunity when we are at the same time reducing the structural costs associated with serving that load. And another important -- there's two important points about our energy efficiency program. First of all, the incentive which in the 2016 energy law was increased to 20% of cost to achieve. So currently, we're running at about $34 million incentive and that'll grow to the $45 million zone in \u2013 by 2022. But we also have with annual rate filings then we true up our sales annually. So that gets captured as we go forward. On demand response, we've filed recently for a demand response incentive mechanism similar to our energy efficiency. We expect it will be in about the $20 million range by the 2022 timeframe as well, that is just \u2013 we don't have the final determination about that. But in the energy law of 2016, it was also directed that there should be an incentive mechanism for demand response, because all of this is about shaving that peak. Our system is overbuilt for the purposes of serving a peak and so through energy efficiency and demand response, we can shave the peak and that's really a very important aspect of our clean and lean strategy. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil : Sounds great. Thank you. My other question is, on page 9 you show that you're adding wind in those three buckets. What I'm wondering is about your appetite for wind outside of the utility rate case at enterprises. I see the new one in Ohio is to service GM. Is that more about customer service than the earnings contribution, or is it all of the above? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, all of the above. It's always about the triple bottom line. And when we say people, plan and profit, people are our customers. And so, when a great customer like General Motors has an opportunity that we can serve elsewhere, we do it when it's opportunistic, we don't have a pipeline of projects, we're not trying to be aggressive in this part of the business, but when opportunities emerge whether it's with a customer like General Motors or perhaps a municipality like Lansing Board of Water & Light where we just did a solar project. The fact is we're good at this stuff. We have a core competence in building and operating renewable assets, and so when we can deploy that in a customer-centric way and grow earnings, we're not going to do it. We definitely want to grow earnings and have utility like returns with those projects and so it is the triple bottom line in action. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil : Very good to hear. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Oh. Good morning, guys. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Jonathan. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And congratulations, Phil, and thank you as well for many years of help. My question, Patti, do you have any early sort of feeling on how the commission and stakeholders are reacting to the IRP? In particular, you obviously choosing not to include a gas plant and this vision of a future was more modular. Just any sense of where the pressure points may be in that proposal? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. We are getting a lot of feedback and it's all extremely positive, Jonathan, as you can imagine. I think surprise might be a word that people would use to say, wow, the utility is actually doing what they've been talking about and they've really put the pen to paper to model out how this really clean and lean future could be possible. And so, I will also say that we did a lot of work prior to filing the IRP with stakeholder engagement with the staff, with the commissioners, with the community groups, environmental groups, our big business customers, et cetera. And so I think all of that hard work that the team did to enroll others has made this so far so good. It is a contested proceeding, so we will, over the next several months, get documented feedback from people who might want to intervene. I would suggest that the biggest challenge in the IRP is getting the pricing right for these new renewables, which is why in the context of the IRP we included competitive bidding and the potential to earn on PPAs where someone else has a better price to deliver the new renewables. That's an important aspect, and we made it really clear that this is a packaged deal. And there's not an opportunity to sort of cherry-pick pieces like, yes, do all the wind, and do all the solar, but don't do competitive bidding. That's not acceptable. We want to make sure that the price is right, and the model was built around having competitive prices. So we're pretty excited about it. I think we are definitely taking a position to put our walk where our talk is, and so far so good. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just as a follow-up to that, it would \u2013 clearly, you're not proposing bringing DIG into the utility, which, you at one point had talked about. So can you talk to us about your plans for that facility assuming the IRP goes along as filed? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. We talk long and hard about that and considered it in the model and decided that DIG actually has more value outside of the utility than inside the utility, particularly the price that we would have to bring it into the utility to get an affiliate transaction approved. And so, we felt like having it outside the utility has more growth potential. And as more base load power plants close, there's going to be more demand in MISO for power. And so DIG has a good opportunity to continue to serve the market well and be accretive in the long run. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And then, finally, Rejji, you mentioned the contractual obligation at MCV or the option to reduce the price. I think you said in 2025. Could you just remind us how that works? How much it can come down? How much headroom that creates, et cetera? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. So the current contract is around $55 to $60 per megawatt hour. And we have estimated that upon repricing and extending five years that there would be at a minimum about $55 million in reductions of fixed costs now. The equivalent dollar per megawatt hour I don't have those specifics, but we think about $55 million of fixed cost savings which make the contract certainly much more on market today versus where it is today rather. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Is that a annual number or is that the... Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yes, annual. That's a run rate savings and again that's just fixed costs. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: And basically the contract price comes down in half for those five years. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And it sounds like that price is necessarily set. You're talking about needing to kind of rebid or something? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: No, no, no. It's contractually \u2013 we'll revise and effectively, as Patti commented, cut in half. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that. I think that's it. Thank you. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Phil, congratulations. After the party if you don't mind calling me I wanted to dust off my old CMS oil and gas model on that Equatorial Guinea well that we used to do together. That's okay with you? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. You can have it, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. Back in 2001 or whatever it was. You've been around a long time, Phil. You've been great at your job. Thank you very much. The question I have is with regard to the IRP. Forgive me, if I haven't read it fully but is there anything in there that utilizes that battery storage technologies for load shift in your market? Patti, I presume you've looked at this because the lithium-ion battery technology comes from your former story arc in the auto industry. Is there a place for battery storage given the remarkable declines we're seeing in the \u2013 what the future delivery costs are for that technology in your service territory? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. We included some battery but that's the neat thing about this IRP. We have assumptions and we used what we considered conservative assumptions with a 35% reduction in battery cost and in most of the scenarios. There was another scenario where the costs didn't come down as much, but it turned out that renewables still panned pretty favorably even without a lot of storage. So I expect in future filings that the storage component will increase because we expect technology to evolve. We are very bullish that technology can change and \u2013 but we wanted to conservatively plan about the changes in the IRP itself. So we have some storage in it, particularly in the outer years, but I wouldn't be surprised in future filings if that number would grow and therefore reduce some of the renewable generation because as we can make these renewable assets more dispatchable, obviously, that's better. And I am a believer that even with the four-hour battery, with the nature of our peak in Michigan that could serve as a great complement to existing renewable assets. And I'll just remind you. We have a lot of experience with storage with the Ludington Pumped Storage Plant. That is a great big battery and we dispatch it every day, so we're very familiar with how it complements to our existing renewables today and how to maximize the value of that storage, we're excited about the technology breakthroughs. The automakers are telling us that their batteries aren't going to be available for reuse for some time because they're not failing as fast as they expect. And some people are predicting that these EVs are going to have 500,000 mile lifespan which makes the batteries not available as soon as we'd like but certainly our relationship with GM puts us in a good position as they become available, we can get creative with grid and applications and seeing where we could deploy modular storage. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : So that's interesting there's a difference between deploying a battery off the assembly line and then deploying a battery that's been repurposed from a used electric vehicle. So you don't see the technology yet or at least in the story arc of your current IRP competing head-to-head with a gas peaker, the technology hasn't crossed over on a... Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, we didn't add gas peakers in our IRP, so about 300 megawatts of solar in the outer years of the IRP, or 300 megawatts of battery storage rather in the outer years of the IRP. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Got you. Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Hey, Michael. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Just a follow-up on that, by the way, hey, Phil, congratulations and have a great retirement. Just to follow up on that last question if -- what kind of costs decline assumption are you making when you're forecasting $3 billion of opportunity in the latter part of the 10-year plan, that's pretty far out. We're seeing pretty steep cost declines. Does that mean we're going to see more megawatts of battery storage and renewables or is there going to be some other \u2013 would that lead -- could cost declines leave room for other types of projects? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yes. So we assume 35% cost reduction in solar throughout the life of the IRP. But I will tell you from the point that we started modeling and trust me we did hundreds of different scenarios and sensitivities. It might not have been in the capacity of like bitcoin mining and energy use, but if you might come close, we are modelers, we're running like crazy. But all the models that they ran in total had about a 35% price reduction for solar and for storage. Your prediction and my prediction are yet to materialize. There's a lot of discussion about that, but I will say from the point we started modeling to the point we filed our IRP, a lot of that 35% reduction in solar in particular actually had materialized and is showing up in some unsolicited bids for solar. And so we've recently done an RFP that we'll be reviewing and building in those cost savings to future filings, which is why it's so important that this IRP gets re-filed on a regular basis to make sure that all the assumptions are correct. But I would say if the prices drop more, it would leave room to execute the plan at a more cost effective method and allow us to do that gas distribution work and electric distribution work that is so important and we have such a backlog to do. Not everyone will love the clean and lean, not every utility could really subscribe to the clean and lean approach that we have, but the demands for capital in our gas system and our electric distribution system enable us to be extremely cost effective in all \u2013 in fact demand that we are cost effective in all aspects of the business. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's great. And just another question about the local clearing requirement. My understanding is the courts rejected it and I'm just wondering what the next steps are at this point? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. This issue -- first of all, let's just be clear, it has no impact on earnings or guidance or there's no effect of that court order though we vehemently disagree with the court order. When the law was passed, and trust me, I was at the table. The intent was very clear that this local clearing requirement be a component, because it's -- Michigan has unique characteristics and that we're a peninsula and there's limited transmission import capacity. Therefore, what the local clearing requirement was designed to do was to establish that if anybody was selling power in Michigan, it had to be some portion of it needed to be in the Peninsula. And so given that, the fact that it was ordered that the commission doesn't have the authority, we completely disagree with. So we will be taking it most likely to the Supreme Court here in Michigan, there are others who are joining us including the commission. We fully support that the way that they indicated their authority -- or exercise their authority was absolutely legal and authorized by the statute. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, and echo those thoughts on Phil. Thank you for all your help over close to 20 years now. Rejji, can you just review what you said about shifting cash flows between 2018 and 2019? What's behind that? And I assume that is earnings neutral because you'd \u2013 assuming those funds go to rate bears anyway? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yes. So to answer your last question first, yes, it's earnings neutral, no impact on earnings. The reason why we are anticipating a little bit of upside in OCF this calendar year is because the pace at which the tax related savings from tax reform getting returned to customers is a little slower than we had anticipated and that's because the process that was offered up by the commission suggests contested cases. So there's a little process and rightfully so because we need to make sure that we get the allocations right to the various customer classes and that's why it's taking a little longer than anticipated. And so we still plan to return $165 million to our customers, we initially anticipated most of that or good portion almost all would be done in 2018. But it looks like that will essentially drip into 2019. And so, as you think about the cash flow forecast, we said we'd be flat on the heels of tax reform for 2018 and 2019 at $1.65 billion. And so, if we overachieve to some extent this year, we expect we'll feel some of that hurt in 2019. And so you really should think about the two years collectively. And so assume $3.3 billion over those two years. And again we may be a little bit up this year and a little bit down next year. And all-in over the five-year period, more importantly, we expect to generate an aggregate $9 billion of cash flow and we should be back on that trajectory of about $100 million per year increase starting in 2020. Is that helpful? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Very much so. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Hi, Praful. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. So just another quick question on the IRP, I know you've taken plenty on those. But just to understand given you've run so many sensitivities on it, where are the pressure points and then are there any areas that you feel either gas prices go up or anything else that could spike up that could lead to either pushback or any responses from the commission or anybody else who kind of responds to the IRP? How do you see that playing out? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. The purpose for running all those scenarios and sensitivities is to choose and our preferred plan is the most resilient to changing conditions, whether it'd be gas prices or maybe the technology does not evolve as fast or maybe load doesn't materialize. An important part of our clean and lean strategy here is, as we add modular resources we can more quickly build out supply to match demand as we know it's materializing. It is so much more dynamic, flexible and adaptable which is the secret, frankly, to our financial success. Our whole business model hinges on our ability to be adaptable and be flexible under changing conditions no matter what they are. And so this IRP is reflective of our tradition of no big bet being able to have a plan that's both cost effective for customers but flexible if conditions change and so we really think the preferred plan is definitely the most resilient over a variety of changing -- potential changing factors. And then we get to re-file at a -- we're required to file every five years and if something material changed earlier than that, then we could file sooner. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Fair enough. That's super helpful. And then secondly, on the operating cash flow point, and for 2018 and 2019, Rejji, it's fair enough to look at it on a combined basis, but just wanted to confirm does that include the refunds for deferred income taxes or is that separate from that $1.65 billion? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. That $1.65 billion does not include the deferred income tax give-back. Now what we have highlighted is that we think the total aided that will be returned to customers over time is $1.6 billion. And that's largely the protected class of accumulated deferred income tax associated with property. And so, we think that if you add that to the $1.65 billion, that's probably another, if you take it over the average life of the assets, another $50 million to $60 million. So it's not included in that calculation, but rightfully so because the initial filing to decide how and the pace at which that money gets paid back, that has yet to be filed, that's scheduled for October 1, and then they'll be contested case or a process beyond then. So I think it's not until about 2019, and we will have a resolution as to exactly how much and when and at what pace. Is that helpful? Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. That's super helpful. And on the unprotected side, is that the same kind of concept where you kind of wait to see how it plays out first? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. That will be part of that calculation C-filing that we'll provide in October. And there we do have actually a pretty decent amount of both unprotected liabilities and assets that we'll have to think through, and there isn't the same level of clarity that you have run the protected class where it effectively follows the principles of normalization. There is a lot more ambiguity in the code as to how you treat the unprotected classes. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Fair enough. And then I guess from last call just to follow up, if there's anything incremental on EnerBank from a strategic perspective that we should be aware of? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Nothing has changed on EnerBank. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right (44:29). Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of BoA. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Julien. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. And congratulations, Phil. Congratulations, Travis, everyone is moving on up here. I like it. So perhaps just to follow up on a quick question here. I suppose first with regards to the IRP, can we just quickly discuss the $3 billion incremental in the timeline to see some of that reflected in the program. I suppose given the fact that that's predominantly oriented at least in your words towards solar, how do you actually see commence construction safe harbor drive some of the decision in time making, and could you actually see some CapEx dollars even flow out as soon as next year just to try to qualify some of the assets given just how solar oriented the incremental generation might be. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: So, a big part of when we will do solar is when we need the additional capacity on the system and we don't show in the near-term requiring new large capital investments around new solar to be added to the system. So the model definitely shows it in the outer years and we factored in the ITC ramp-down. And so the extension of it will affect the modeling in some of those years. We do have an RFP out for some small amount of solar in the near-term but the big bulk of it really comes in the outer years and again tax treatment is one of the sensitivities and we assumed the current tax treatment and solar still tend because keep in mind, Julien, in Michigan, our peak is in the summer and MISO gives a 53% capacity factor to solar on peak. And so it has a higher capacity factor than wind because it is available when we need it which is on those hot summer days in Michigan. So, it lines up very nicely and when combined with demand response, that is a very good combination and mix for us. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Understood. Okay. And then a little bit perhaps turning back to the last series of questions on perhaps the equity ratio, I know there's a variety of different pieces that contribute to rate base growth relative to earnings power growth of the core utility. Can you comment a little bit about the potential for higher authorized equity ratio and how that might mesh into your financial plan? And I know that the deferred tax balance has also kind of mesh into this as kind of previously described too, so. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Julien, I think you characterized it appropriately. I mean, there's a lot that would go into that equation. And as you know, we plan conservatively. And so, you have really a few sources of inputs that would impact the equity thickness. Now, at the end of the day, it's ultimately the commission's decision, but you have the aided return that I had talked about earlier. And so, at a minimum, if you assume $50 million to $60 million will do return to customers over, say, a 25-year to 30-year period, that's going to by definition as you reduce that zero cost of capital, that represents about 20% of the rate making capital structure. You're going to have some level of equity thickness accretion over time and so that would create upward pressure on the equity thickness. At the same time, the commission has asked us to glide path down to a level closer to 50%/50% over the next, I'd say, five or six years. Now, that perspective from the commission was offered up prior to tax reform. And so, once the law was enacted in December of last year, we have made the point in subsequent filings both in our gas case as well as our electric case that we filed in May that that has obviously balance sheet implications. And so the glide path should be reconsidered. And so, I think you put all that in a Veg-O-Matic. My sense is, we ultimately would like to see the equity thickness kind of level out and stay fairly consistent with where it is today, but it all remains to be seen. But suffice it to say, we'll plan it conservatively. Is that helpful? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Absolutely. And the timeline just getting that clarity, I mean, I imagine this is probably in tandem with the same 19 dockets that you alluded to just now with the taxes? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: We'll find out around where we end up, I'd say, on a case by case basis. In our recent electric case in March, we were at 52.5% and in the gas case, it's currently pending. I think we're ending up around there, call it, 52.5% equity relative to debt based on the staff position and the ALJ's position. So, we'll see where we're at on a case by case basis, but so far trending good as I see it, trending well I would say. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. All right. Perfect. And just to be clear about this is the last little detail in the IRP. The less than 225 megawatts qualification here, I presume almost the entirety of what you're talking about in terms of incremental generation given the modularity element would just not require the same kind of approval process, right? It would all fall under that threshold? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Correct. And so we put that in the no big bets category. The modular plan can match supply and demand more quickly and then we can have faster turnaround when we add new supply. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks for the clarity. All the best. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Julien. Operator : And our next question today comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Ali. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. First question, I wanted to \u2013 the point you all make when you look at your CapEx plans is the big constraint you put is that customer rates should be at or below inflation in terms of growth rate. So when you apply that I just wanted to find out how much capacity do you have over your 10-year plan to increase CapEx if you needed? I'm assuming that entire $3 billion can be absorbed if it comes to fruition, but do you have even more capacity than that? How should we be thinking about that? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Ali, I would just start by saying, as you know, we really do our detailed modeling on a five-year basis. And so, as you know, on the heels of tax reform when we provided our five-year plan that was revised to take tax reform into account we increased it from $9 billion to $10 billion. And we believe that we have \u2013 with that sort of capital investment program we can comfortably keep rates on a total basis when you include the commodity costs at or below inflation. So we feel good about that on a five-year basis. We have not yet provided a new 10-year plan, but we have noted in the IRP it does create $3 billion of incremental supply opportunities. And so it's too premature at this point to tell whether you take the $3 billion plus our prior plan of $18 billion and that we can comfortably afford. And so there's more modeling to come on that. But I would say at this point, we are certainly going to stick to our principles as we think about the next five-year tranche and we're going to try to make sure that we can afford to spend that as well as a CapEx on an annual basis and make sure that we don't again compromise our principles around customer affordability or balance sheet strength, I might add. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. So, but fair to say that at a minimum if it comes to that the $3 billion increment can be absorbed on a preliminary basis? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: We will certainly make sure that we can absorb it if we're going to offer up a plan that includes that for sure. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. And then separately as you alluded to this as well, so you still have some high cost debt at the holding company at the parent level. Can you just remind us what the earnings opportunity is from either paying that off or refinancing that just from a big picture perspective and is that all built into the 6% to 8% growth rate targets that you have out there? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. So, refinancing opportunities are not baked into the plan, or at least I'll say premature refinancing opportunities are not baked in the plan. And whether as it pertains to EPS accretion and upside, that's all a function of obviously the cost of debt that you get for the new money and so it remains to be seen the levels of accretion that we'll potentially get. We did get about a $0.01 or $0.02 of upside on the remaining tranche of our 8.75% notes that we took out which we'll realize next year but we still have, I think, at least one or two six handles at the parent coming due. I'd say the next big tranche is in Q1 of 2020 from a maturity perspective. So we'll keep an eye on it. But I think it's too premature at this point to talk about accretion, dilution and we haven't thought about what the cost of debt will be that we'll take it out and also what the tenure will be. So there are a lot of variables that go into that math, as you know. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: But that's a cushion that you still retain as you track your 6% to 8% target? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: It's certainly an opportunity and so we always think about sources or levers that we can pull either up or down to make sure that we can continue to prolong this path of 6% to 8% growth over the long-term. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Chris Morgan of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. It's actually Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. So just two quick follow-ups. So one is you mentioned that the IRP would allow you to actually potentially earn on PPAs which I've never seen and so I was just wondering how that's going to be structured. And secondly, given that more and more Midwestern utilities seem to be stepping away from adding gas-fired generation, does it change your views how your semi-merchant assets will be perceived as far as contracting and then demand for these assets going forward? Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Great questions, Angie. First of all, earning on the PPA is a part of our competitive pricing expectations associated with adding new renewables. So obviously, we are biased toward owning the assets and that would be our preference. We've learned over time that long-term PPAs no matter how competitive they are when you sign them are inflexible over time and can lock our customers into paying more than they should. And so when we own the assets, we have more flexibility about how and how long they are operated. And so it definitely is a preference. However, we're also very committed to competitive pricing for customers. And so in the event that somebody with \u2013 if we do a solicitation for new solar and new solar bids come that are competitive, that are supplied by someone else, well then, we would want to make sure that our balance sheet and our investors are rewarded for being able to back up their financing for those new assets. So, there's no doubt that they would be leveraging our balance sheet and we think that investors should be rewarded for that. So, we have a commitment or we have a proposal that would allow for that. There will be lots of discussion. And as I mentioned, the IRP is a contested proceeding and so I think that that definitely will be a point of discussion with interveners and with the commission and how that shakes out. In terms of the role that base load gas plays, I will say we at CMS are uniquely positioned because we do have two utility base load plants or gas plants, Zeeland and Jackson as well as our Ludington Pumped Storage. When you ask about \u2013 so they provide a nice base load combination to our renewables and incremental renewables. When we talk about then DIG, you bet, DIG plays a role in the future to provide that base load continuity and dispatchability that's a benefit to Michigan to their potential customers as well as to MISO. So, they definitely -- like I mentioned earlier, we see more value for DIG outside the utility than in at this stage for that reason. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Just on the PPAs, I mean I understand that you're trying to minimize the cost to your ratepayers, but PPA does embed a certain return and so a return on the PPA plus a return equivalent to the rate base value of that PPA, wouldn't that be actually earning a return twice on the same project? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: No. No, because if the asset was owned by someone else, you're not earning the return on twice. What's happening is, the only way that that developer can get financing for a large capital investment like that is to have quality off-taker like us and to be able to leverage our balance sheet with credit capability to show that they can then have a quality off-taker. So it's just giving recognition to the fact that we are the backstop and therefore, our investors should be recognized for that. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Andrew Levi of ExodusPoint. Please go ahead. Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP : Hey, sorry about that. Actually I think I'm all set. I mean, the only other question I have \u2013 the markets are developing \u2013 is just looking at the auto industry yesterday and the last couple days talking about steel and that cutting into their margins, obviously, you get it back through rate recovery, but just are you seeing the same thing as far as where there is pipe replacement or whatever other type of construction that you guys are doing? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: We're not seeing it yet, but I'm sure we will. It's impossible that all the prices of commodities are going up. We're longer term purchasers. We're not buying on a daily basis like the automakers are. And so, when we sign fixed contracts for supplies for construction projects, we're more forward. And so, again, this modular build-out of renewables actually protects us from some of that too because we can build in time and adapt the plan if prices change and they become more expensive, we can adapt to different plan. So, I would say that we definitely don't have the same kind of exposures that the autos have. Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Hey. Congratulations, Phil. Can you hear me? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Yes. Thanks. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : So, a lot of my questions have been answered. Just back to the Michigan Court of Appeals on Greg's question, you mentioned that it doesn't impact earnings. What impact does it have, if in fact the Michigan Court of Appeals ruling holds? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: So, the reason why we were fighting to get that corrected is because currently AES has leveraged excess capacity on the market and pass along to their customers -- to our retail open access customers basically for free and that's a cost shift to all utility customers. So, without correcting this, local clearing requirement of new generation sources, then our customers continued to pick up the tab for alternative energy suppliers customers, the retail open access customers. And so, it's all about price competitiveness. And we've gone through the math on this because we think it's wrong and we think there's two issues. One, we have to have visibility where the power is going to be supplied and because of the constraints of the Peninsula. It really does need to be -- some portion of it really does need to be located in Michigan. And in the absence of having a local clearing requirements and alternative energy supplier, then we have to build it and our customers have to pay for it even though it's benefiting retail open access customers, it's a big cost shift, it's complicated, it's not transparent and I can see how the appellate court was confused about it because it is complicated and that's why we spent so much time on the legislation, and that's why the commission plays such an important role sifting through complex issues like this. That's why we supported our commission and we think that they're absolutely in the right place on this issue. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Do you think it impacts the value of merchant capacity in Michigan? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, yes, because if a local clearing requirement was instituted, DIG would be more valuable because it is in Michigan. But that really is not factored into our plans. We definitely didn't build the LCR into DIG's forward-looking earnings. What we really are talking about here is price competitiveness and standing for our utility customers. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Fair enough. And then with respect to the PPA proposal, the making -- making the impact of a PPA be reflected in the regulatory proceeding with respect to the sort of parasitic -- sort of addressing the parasitic issue of somebody having a PPA with you guys, would you guys be indifferent, I guess, is what I mean I apologize too, I haven't read the full IRP. But I mean if it was a contract versus, A, I guess, if you could just elaborate a little bit more on how you guys stand with respect to some somebody winning a PPA versus you guys building the solar facility would have the debottleneck? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, I do, Paul. Paul, it's a good question. Indifferent is not the right word. We're not indifferent. We would definitely prefer to own the asset. There's no doubt about that. However, we also recognize that we want price competitiveness in Michigan, and so if a PPA with our earning on it is more competitive for customers, then that would be an alternative we would entertain on behalf of customers and we have so much CapEx required in the rest of the business that it actually frees up capital to be deployed to other critical assets. So that's really how we think about. We've just had all this experience with PPAs and we talk about them all the time that when we signed the PPAs, they were great prices. 20 years later, it feels like golly, why do we have these PPAs. We'd like to be -- we'd like to have more flexibility. And so we've just learned over time that a PPA sound good on paper, you can make the numbers pen, but then in reality conditions change and you'd like to have the kind of flexibility that can better serve customers. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, awesome. And then just finally one clarification with a question Julien was asking and your answer on capital structure, you guys said that you were being conservative. Did you mean conservative being that you guys were modeling in a lower equity ratio or did you mean more conservative in that like you -- could you just elaborate a little bit, is that what you meant? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. When we say conservative, like I said, ultimately, we'd like to see at the current levels of about 52.5% equity relative to debt. We'd like to think given the implications of tax reform, given the realities of that aided being paid out over time and having that natural equity thickness accretion. We'd like to stay where we are today, but we'll model with some assumption that things may change over time. And so when I say conservative, it means that we're not going to take too bullish a position on where the commission may end up here. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Is that helpful? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : That is helpful, because sometimes you might think equity's ratio being higher is more conservative, but... Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And that's it, and once again thanks a lot and congratulations, Phil. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Paul. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Patti Poppe for any closing remarks. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Excellent. Thanks, Rocco. Thank you everyone for joining us this morning and we really look forward to seeing you at our upcoming events. Operator : Thank you, ma'am. This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

Travis Miller - Morningstar Vedula Murti - Avon Capital Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CMS Energy 2018 Third Quarter Results. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 PM Eastern Time running through November 1. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Srikanth Maddipati - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Patti. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Sri, and thank you everyone for joining us on our call today. We're looking forward to Halloween next week but there are no tricks here, only treats, our predictable financial results. With that I'll begin with an overview and a focus on our triple bottom line and Rejji will follow up with more details on our financial results and outlook. With another great quarter behind us, we're pleased to report adjusted earnings of $1.93 per share through the first nine months of the year, which are up 16% from our 2017 results. We're also pleased to announce that we're raising the bottom end of our full year guidance by $0.01 with 2018 adjusted earnings guidance now at $2.31 to $2.34 per share, which further demonstrates our confidence in our ability to deliver again this year, giving us our 16th year of consistent industry-leading financial performance. Now as I've stated previously, when we moved to 6% to 8% growth from 5% to 7%, we were signaling that we raised the midpoint of our range from 6% to 7%, showing our confidence in continuing to deliver 7% as we have for 15 years in a row. Last year, we delivered a strong 7% which was towards the high end of our 6% to 8% 2017 guidance, so we would be disappointed if we did not deliver towards the high end of our guidance again this year. We're also initiating 2019 adjusted earnings guidance at $2.46 to $2.50 per share which reflects 6% to 8% growth, no resets or surprises here. As we typically do, we'll revisit our guidance based on our actual results during our fourth quarter earnings call. And we're reaffirming our long-term growth of 6% to 8% with a bias towards the midpoint. Slide 5 is a great reminder of how much work we're doing day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year to provide the consistent financial results you've come to expect. We focus on prioritizing reinvestment opportunities in periods where we experienced better than expected cost performance or weather benefits like we've seen throughout this year. In times like we saw last year with poor weather and significant storm activity, we'll rely on our lean operating system and our ability to optimize work to maximize safety and reliability for the benefit of our customers. Since 2013 we've reinvested millions of dollars at the utility, such as low income support of $24 million that helps our most vulnerable customers catch up on energy bills during hard times and reduces risk in our uncollectible accounts for all of our other customers. Right now we remain focused on the work that can be done this year to de-risk next year while providing immediate benefits to customers such as tree trimming in the electric business where we expect to spend $54 million and our gas pipeline integrity and reliability program where we'll spend around $37 million this year. This strategy allows us to deliver on our financial results this year while providing a longer runway for us to deliver the growth you have all come to expect in the coming years. The blue line that you see on slide 5 represents the volatility that we manage year after year to ensure that you continue to experience consistent financial results shown by that straight as an arrow green line. In short, we ride the rollercoaster so you don't have to. Our gas business is a perfect example of our triple bottom line thinking. We commit to a safe and reliable gas system, one of the largest in the country with over 28,000 miles of distribution mains and nearly 1,700 miles of transmission lines, to serve our 1.8 million gas customers. We protect our customers and the planet with every dollar we invest in our system. Our investment in the gas system will be about half of our total capital plan over the next five years. That's the triple bottom line in action. The skilled workforce serving our gas customers is a critical enabler to our ability to execute our plan. Not that long ago, we couldn't find qualified candidates for many of the positions we needed to fill, so we started our veteran boot camp in 2016. To date, Consumers Energy has hired 116 gas workers from the program with a 94% retention rate. It's a three-week training program followed by a 90-day internship and then full time job offers. The program accounts for 47% of the talent hired into that role over the last three years. This program is far more successful than the previous hiring plans, where we typically saw a 50% failure rates for the physical dig assessment which eliminated the candidate from further consideration. In fact, earlier this month, I was at our new employee orientation and I asked for all the veterans in the room to stand. I was overwhelmed to see that over half the room was filled with those who have served our country. I am so proud to have these veterans on our team and putting their skills and knowledge to work for our company and our customers. My coworkers are enhancing the safety of our system by replacing older services and mains that are a source of gas leaks. These necessary replacements not only improve the safety of our system, but also reduce potential methane emissions. We're proud to have reduced our methane emissions by over 15% in the last 10 years, but we are never satisfied and we have an internal methane reduction task force dedicated to improving our performance. All of this needed work requires capital at a time when the commodity price of natural gas has never been more stable or affordable. Now is the time for us to invest in our system in a way that customers can afford. Ultimately these affordable investments lead to attractive returns for you, our investors. And we're thankful for your support in enabling this work and for making Michigan safer. Our consistency and predictability are the hallmark of our financial results every year. Part of what makes us consistent is our ability to adapt to changing external conditions. With the gubernatorial elections next month, I know many of you may wonder what will change in Michigan and for CMS Energy. Regardless of who is in office we have proven that we are able to work with everyone. When we stand for Michigan, people want to stand with us. While we can't predict the results, I can tell you we know the candidates well and look forward to working with the new governor to serve the citizens of Michigan. As slide 7 shows, over the years we've seen governors from both parties and the makeup of our Commission change and have experienced varying economic and weather impacts as well, but regardless of all those factors we have an ability to deliver consistent financial performance year after year after year after year. With that I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you, Patti. And good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned we're pleased to announce our strong results for the first nine months of the year with adjusted earnings per share of $1.93, up 16% from the comparable period in 2017. On a weather-normalized basis earnings per share for the first nine months were down 6% versus the same period in 2017, largely due to the execution of operating pull-aheads over the past two quarters, given the weather-driven and cost savings upside realized to-date. Patti touched on a couple of examples already, such as tree trimming and our pipeline integrity program which deliver safety and reliability benefits to our customers. We've also pulled ahead additional gas pipeline maintenance work, to improve the reliability of our system and minimize gas leaks while opportunistically re-financing select bonds at the parent, among other customer and employee initiatives to de-risk 2019. For the third quarter we reported earnings per share of $0.59 this year compared to $0.62 per share for the third quarter of 2017. As noted, given our solid performance to-date, we have raised the low end of our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range and our revised range is now $2.31 to $2.34 per share. All-in, we are well ahead of plan and we'll continue to look for reinvestment opportunities in the fourth quarter including both operating and non-operating pull-aheads to improve our likelihood of success in 2019 and beyond. As you can see on the waterfall chart on slide 9, weather has positively impacted our year-to-date results by $0.42 per share, with more than half of that coming from last year's poor weather rolling off. As you'll note, the cost savings bucket has shrunk from $0.10 per share of positive variance through the second quarter to $0.03 per share for the first nine months due to the aforementioned reinvestment strategy and heavy storm activity. But we continue to see lower benefits expense and other operational efficiencies. The weather and cost performance related upside have also been supported by $0.06 of higher rate relief net of investment costs relative to 2017. These sources of positive variance have been partially offset by the absence of favorable tax benefits realized in the third quarter of 2017 and by lower non-weather sales, largely driven by our expanded energy efficiency programs. It is worth noting that reductions in customer usage attributable to our energy efficiency programs are trued up in rate cases through updates to our sales forecast. Given our sizable reinvestment opportunities this year, we have highlighted some of those levers that we have already pulled and some that are in process in the table on the right-hand side of the chart. But needless to say, we always proceed with caution in this regard particularly late in the year in the event we have mild weather and/or unforeseen storm activity, among other risks. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we are not awaiting any further regulatory outcomes in 2018 given the recent uncontested settlement of our gas case in August with an $11 million revenue increase and a 10% ROE. So, as mentioned, we will be acutely focused on operating and non-operating pull-aheads for the balance of the year to the benefit of customers and investors. As we turn the page on the regulatory calendar for 2018, we continue to parallel-path three major items. There is our pending electric case where we filed a revised revenue request of $44 million as part of rebuttal, down from $58 million largely due to a decrease in contingency estimates for select capital investments and lower realized debt financing costs. As always, we are eager to pass on these savings to customers to minimize the amount of our rate requests. We expect a proposal for a decision or PFD from the administrative law judge in late December, and a final order from the Commission in March of next year absent a settlement. In regards to the IRP, we're in the evidentiary phase of the process. The MPSC staff and other intervenors recently filed their testimony in mid-October, which we found largely constructive. And we expect the final order from the Commission around the second quarter of next year. Lastly, we'll look to file our next gas case with a revenue request of about $245 million which reflects our continued prioritization on safety and upgrading our gas system while we remain in an environment of historically low natural gas prices. Slide 11 highlights some of our key gas infrastructure projects and the significant investments we will continue to make to improve the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system. We have steadily ramped up our focus and spend in this area by building a skilled and dedicated workforce as Patti noted by identifying and prioritizing key areas on our system that are in need of upgrading and by finding ways to offset much of the bill impact to customers by capitalizing on low natural gas prices and through other cost reduction initiatives. As part of our pending gas rate case filing we plan to replace approximately 25,000 vintage service lines and roughly 140 miles of distribution mains, among other programs. We're also planning to inspect and remediate as necessary over 950 miles of pipeline. It is worth noting that many of these maintenance and inspection programs that we have in place are routine annual activities and have been incorporated in previous investment recovery mechanisms or trackers approved by the Commission. Lastly, we'll be extending our capacity to deliver gas on our system to accommodate customer requests and future load growth. Slide 12 illustrates our emphasis on gas as evidenced by our five-year capital plan of $10 billion, roughly half of which is comprised of gas infrastructure investments. We continue to focus on the needs of our aging gas system as reflected in the forecasted material increase in gas as a percentage of total rate base to 40% from 30% over the next five years, as highlighted in the chart on the right-hand side of the page. The balance of our five-year capital plan consists of substantial electric distribution investments in accordance with our five-year electric distribution plan filed in March and increased investments in renewable generation as per our Integrated Resource Plan or IRP. Our capital investment needs remain significant beyond the five-year period as well. As we work through regulatory proceedings and our financial planning cycle, we expect that the longer term capital mix will continue to evolve and we look forward to providing an update to our 10-year capital plan in 2019 once we have better visibility on our long term capacity plan. As we've highlighted in the past, the primary constraint on the pace at which we invest capital is customer affordability and we are confident that we can continue to deliver cost reductions to minimize customer bill increases. On the gas side, our numerous capital investment programs will enable reduced maintenance costs on items such as leak repair among other benefits. Reduced gas, O&M costs coupled with our expectation of relatively flat natural gas prices that are minimized through our purchase and storage strategy, among other cost reduction initiatives should keep customer bills affordable. We've experienced such success in the past as evidenced in the chart on the lower right-hand side of slide 13. Since 2013, our gas bills have declined by over 25% relative to inflation, despite approximately $4 billion of aggregate investment over that period. In the electric business, we will benefit from high priced, power purchase agreements rolling off over time while also realizing fuel and O&M expense savings as we retire our coal fleet. Our power supply related savings will be supplemented with continued electric system upgrades, which will reduce service restoration expenses, among other benefits. For the consolidated entity, our efforts on waste elimination through the CE Way continue to bear fruit across the organization and we continue to benefit from attrition management and non-operating savings from opportunistic re-financing and tax planning. Speaking of taxes, on October 1, we filed a proposal to return approximately $1.6 billion of deferred taxes from utility customers over the next several decades, in accordance with the federal tax code. As a reminder, the total impact of federal tax reform will deliver an estimated 4% rate reduction opportunity, and every 1% reduction in customer rates generates about $400 million of incremental capital investment capacity for the benefit of customers and investors. As we look prospectively at the consolidated business, unsurprisingly, our growth continues to be driven by our utility with its robust capital needs on both the gas and electric systems, and forward-looking filings such as the IRP and our five-year electric distribution plan provides long-term transparency for the MPSC and other key stakeholders, which should provide more visibility regarding regulatory outcomes in the future. Outside of the utility, we'll continue to operate our existing Enterprises fleet with a low-risk mindset and take advantage of attractive, contracted renewable opportunities like the recent wind PPA with valued customers like GM. When we couple our utility earnings contribution with contracted non-utility growth and prudent financial planning, you can see why we have confidence in our ability to continue to grow at 6% to 8% over the long term. And with that I'll turn the call back over to Patti. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Rejji. In summary, our investment thesis is driven by a large and aging system in need of capital investments, a growing and diverse service territory, a constructive regulatory statute, a unique self-funding model that is enhanced by the CE Way and tax reform and a healthy balance sheet to fund our plan cost effectively. We are confident in our ability to deliver consistent industry-leading growth and superior total shareholder return over the long term as we do the worrying for you and adapt to changing conditions. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you very much, Patti. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. And our first question today comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hi, Michael. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Michael. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey. What's the \u2013 sorry if I missed this. But what's the base that the 6% to 8% for 2019 is based off of? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. So, Michael, we at this time of the year, when we give guidance in Q3 it's always predicated effectively on the midpoint of our revised guidance, and so as Patti noted our revised 2018 guidance is $2.31 to $2.34 per share and so that's what it's driven off of, but as you know as we get actuals over the course of the fourth quarter and provide our fourth quarter earnings call we'll likely revise that number. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it, got it. That's off the midpoint now of the end in other words, right? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Precisely. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right. And then can you just give us kind of an overview of what you intend to update at the EEI this year? What are the categories of things that will be updated at that point? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. It should be more of the same, Michael. I mean, we generally try to avoid surprises and so if I could characterize some of the topics that will likely come up, we'll talk a bit more about the progression of some of our regulatory items. So there is the pending gas case which should be filed at that point. There's the electric case which continues to progress, and then there is the IRP which is in the evidentiary phase, so we look forward to providing updates on that. Always happy to talk about the capital mix and what we're seeing there and then opportunities to continue to save costs and reduce our cost structure to perpetuate the self-funding strategy. So those are I think the variety of topics we'll cover and we'll have visibility at that point as well on the electoral front and what's taking place on the political side in Michigan. So I think all of those will be things we'll cover, but I don't expect a whole lot new beyond that. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Are there any significant impacts that you perceive from the election, that goes one way or the other or do you expect you'll work well with no matter who wins at this point? And one thing I've heard is that the property tax might become an issue in the Legislature during the potential lame duck session, is that something that you understand? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. So there's is a couple of things. First on the elections themselves, as we said, we're very comfortable with either gubernatorial candidate. We do have term limits in Michigan, so it does result in a lot of turnover in the House and the Senate. But the good news is we passed that statute in 2016 and with large bipartisan support, so the idea of revisiting that would be a pretty long thought, I would suggest. But the new governor will obviously be able to appoint a new commissioner when Norm Saari's term ends mid-year next year. And the way the statute is written that establishes our Commission and our commissioners and their term really prevents what I would describe as shenanigans as a result of elections. We are very comfortable with the terms in statute, the number of parties represented on the Commission is in statute, so the idea that the new governor would replace Norm is very predictable. And they are six months into their new term and so we'll have an opportunity to help understand what the requirements and needs are of that new commissioner. So we're just not too concerned with any effect of the elections. On the property tax.... Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Property tax? Yeah. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: We \u2013 yeah, we've been working with the Senate, they passed a bill proposed on what's called PPT, personal property tax. And in Michigan, when the Michigan tax reform happened I think back in 2012 the utilities were exempted from the reform on PPT. And so we're suggesting that future increases would be capped. And so we're working on that. I think it will be good for customers. When we think about the cost stack for customers, taxes are in there. So any time that we can reduce the tax liability actually for our customers, it's good for Michigan. So that's why we're working on that. I wouldn't hazard to guess of whether it will or won't pass, but it is something that we think will be good for customers so we're for it. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you. Okay, thank you very much. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Jonathan. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good to know that you're riding the rollercoaster for us, so just thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: That's right. Rest easy, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: A question, Rejji, you mentioned that you would potentially \u2013 I forgot the exact word you used but you would perhaps update the 10-year capital plan next year once you have some of the regulatory proceedings further along. Are you talking about sort of rolling it forward because it will be further out in time, sort of fleshing it out or potentially that might change in some quantitative fashion? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. So it's a little of both. It would be a roll-forward of the timeframe but also we would likely increase the capital plan. And we just don't know the extent to which we'll increase it. We talked about in the past the benefits of tax reform and how it's created incremental capital investment capacity to the tune of about $1.6 billion but we also think that the IRP as well as other capital investment opportunities across the gas and electric distributions create opportunities as well. And so we know that there's a nice backlog of capital investment, but as I said in the Q2 call, we want to make sure that we can afford, and I say we, meaning our customers as well as our investors on the balance sheet, can afford to accommodate capital investments. Let's say something in excess of $18 billion which was the old plan. And so we want to make sure we get the math right and also get visibility on some of the regulatory proceedings that I covered. So that's really the gating item and what we'll effectively cover with the new capital plan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That was really all I had. Thank you. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : And our next question today comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning and congratulations on continued good results. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Stephen. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: We've had a \u2013 we had a terrible explosion in the Northeast earlier this year and I was just curious if there were any lessons learned or any changes in thinking in terms of gas safety spending or any other sort of operational adjustments you would make or updates you'd make based on lessons that may have been learned from those explosions? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Thanks for asking, Stephen. Obviously that was a serious situation and we've been very closely linked. In fact, we have about 30 folks who are out in Massachusetts right now assisting. I understand they're going to be coming home safely to us today, so we're wishing them a safe trip home, but we've looked closely. Our system configuration has one distinct difference between medium and standard pressure. We have relief valves that would prevent in an over-pressurized situation over-pressurizing that low pressure system. And so we do think that is an important feature that we have designed into our system. I would say from an investment standpoint, however, it is the enhanced infrastructure replacement program, which is our investment recovery mechanism for gas investment for our mains and now our vintage services is critical to this part of the system. And so we would \u2013 in fact a couple of years ago, we established our own public safety goal, a breakthrough goal that we've been working to replace more vintage services. And we do more inspections than are required by PHMSA on both high consequence and non-high consequence areas just because we know the safety of this system is so important. And given the commodity prices now, customers more now than ever can afford these investments to make the system safe. And it's really a unique point in time where we can do the right thing for the system and we don't have to trade off affordability for the magnitude of investment that we're doing. And so again we're thankful for our investors who make it possible to do that work here in Michigan. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's really helpful color. And Patti, is it your sense that the gas utility industry as a whole is going to respond with a number of proposed changes that could sort of result in a wave of updates of spending or is this more sort of each utility is going to approach this based on their own sort of unique circumstances. How broad I guess is my question in terms of updates or changes that you see from the industry as a result of these explosions? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: I think there could be revised regulations, particularly as it relates to PHMSA and remotely controlled valve configurations. Right now, a lot of times on our distribution systems across the country, it's not remotely controlled. We might have monitoring in place, but we can't control. And so there might be some potential regulations that would result in added investment across the country and across the system. I think for us when we think about our 6% to 8%, it will fit into our existing capital plan. I don't think it changes anything about our outlook. We would be prioritizing obviously safety as always number one in investment prioritization and meeting all regulatory requirements. So I think, again, it all hinges on the fact that safety is the overriding priority and potentially new regulations I think are possible, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's really helpful. And if I could, maybe just one last one on electric vehicle infrastructure. Patti, I was just curious if you would mind giving us your latest thinking on the pace of that spend, the sort of the regulatory steps or any other sort of thoughts you might have about how you're going to roll out EV charging infrastructure? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. And so, you know this is a near and dear subject to my heart, Stephen, as the co-chair on the EEI Electric Transportation Committee. I have been obviously paying close attention nationally, but here at home we filed for $7.5 million infrastructure for EV in our latest electric rate case. The Commission did a great job of convening parties ahead of that filing so we could have some alignment about it. And so I'm thankful for their hard work on that and the conversations that occurred ahead of our filing. We feel good about it. But as I've shared with you, Stephen, and with others, the idea that electric vehicle infrastructure is a huge capital play, I don't necessarily agree with that. I do think that it's an important component of the electrification strategy and as long as EVs are not charged on peak then it net and net reduces the unit cost of energy for all citizens. And so, there is benefit for all for enabling the EV infrastructure. But I'll tell you, in the Detroit Free Press, there was an editorial this week or maybe it was Crain's in Detroit, there was an editorial of a guy who bought an electric car and all his angst of getting around Metro Detroit to get charged and in fact he had his wife following him in his car so he didn't run out of charge. So there's infrastructure required for sure. It hit the press this week. And so I'm sure we'll have continued support to get that infrastructure built out. And faster is better, emission-free vehicles fueled by emission-free power is really our long-term vision. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very good, thank you very much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hi, Patti. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Greg. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Most of the \u2013 I think that the hugely salient questions have been answered. At EEI are we going to get a 2019 visibility on what you're thinking about DIG? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Greg, this is... So, you mean in terms of whether it would be in the utility or just performance, I want to be clear... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : No. I mean, slide 22 has the 2018 guidance and then the aspirational guidance. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: (00:31:57) Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : But it doesn't give us insight into what you're actually seeing and how it's contracted or what you expect market revenues to look like for 2019? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. So we generally have pretty conservative assumptions around capacity sales of DIG which do make up a decent portion of its revenue. But I'll say that the majority of its revenue is already locked in through energy sales forward through 2023. And so we tend to believe that there will continue to be a little bit of softening on the front end of the bilateral capacity mark and so we have pretty conservative assumptions around kilowatt per month assumptions. And then generally, because of the pace at which I'll say the decision around the local clearing requirement in Michigan is progressing where we're now filing an appeal from the Court of Appeals decision that the Commission didn't have an authority to set the local clearing requirement, we think it's going to be a while before you see outcomes like we're highlighting on the right-hand side of that chart where you're seeing $4.50, $7.50 per kilowatt month. And so I'll say our expectations are tempered, but as you think about our 2019 EPS guidance of $2.46 to $2.50 per share, we generally \u2013 I think we'll get about $0.01 of contribution from enterprises that supports that growth. And so, we do still expect decent growth from enterprises, but we're pretty tempered in expectations around capacity sales. Is that helpful? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Yes. Thank you very much. And then the economic conditions and market conditions, interest rates, etcetera. Obviously they don't really have a direct impact on how you plan for the utility, but can you tell us what's going on EnerBank and whether \u2013 I know it's also a very small contributor. But the bank stocks have been behaving, like economic conditions for their business have worsened. I just wonder what you're seeing there. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, I'd say in general EnerBank continues to perform well. And so we assumed in our guidance for 2018 about $0.15 of contribution from EnerBank. We think they are in that zip code. I will admit that the competitive environment has intensified a bit in that sector. And so we are feeling a little bit of pressure associated with that. But if you look at the quality of their portfolio in terms of average FICO scores, the annual growth and then our expectations going forward we still think the business will continue to perform as it has in a variety of different cycles and so EnerBank continues to trend along nicely and we haven't seen much erosion in terms of the portfolio FICO scores or any of that stuff you see when competition intensifies. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Have a good day. See you at EEI. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks. See you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Greg. Operator : And our next question today comes from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Horward Weil. Please go ahead. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Hi, Andrew. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Question for you on the reinvestment. There is a lot of detail and a lot of impressive numbers here with the $0.24 that you flagged down the waterfall chart on page 9. My question is when I think about reinvestments relative to weather it looks like versus normal the weather year-to-date impact has been around $0.20 benefit. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the budget perspective there of where those extra $0.04 are coming from and I believe that's outside of cost savings, maybe you could just elaborate a bit more on some of those reinvestments and how that might impact 2019? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. So a couple of things I'd say. So we're obviously at this point of the year we're well ahead of plan. I'd say we're over $0.20 ahead of plan and so we have been busy putting a lot of dollars to work as we have, really starting in Q2 once we had a very nice winter for the gas business earlier in the year and then a very early start to the summer. And so with that upside, we've put quite a bit to work and so that $0.24 that you see on the right-hand side of slide 9, it represents spend that we put to work in some regard and then spend to come and so we expect by the fourth quarter you'll see a pretty significant expansion of operations and maintenance spend attributable to those pull-aheads and so that offers a couple of benefits. So one, obviously it reduced potential costs in 2019. That's the definition of pull-ahead. You're spending money now that you won't have to spend next year, so there's risk mitigation in that. But also if you think about the bridge, that allows us to grow another, let's say, $0.16 or thereabouts. When you think about our guidance in 2018 versus our guidance in 2019, those are now all sort of discretionary, I'll say items that we're pulling ahead this year that we may not have to go and do next year. And so when you think about the path to delivering another year of 6% to 8%, you're going to lose the benefit of $0.20 of good weather that we had in 2018 and we plan for normal weather, but that will be offset by rate relief net of investments which should give us about $0.10 to $0.14 of upside based on our expectations. You'll get about as mentioned about $0.01 from enterprise, about another $0.01 from EnerBank for growth and then you're going to have about $0.24 of discretionary activities you took on in 2018 that you don't need to take on in 2019 and so all of that should bridge us very nicely to a very good glide path of 6% to 8% growth. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: This might overlap with that question, but the same waterfall chart, usage, enterprises and other year-to-date is down $0.24 year-over-year, but when I look at the reconciliation at the end, it looks it looks like enterprises are kind of flat and corporate and others kind of flat, so I can't imagine $0.24 of usage impact. Maybe you could elaborate what else is going on in there? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, there's quite a bit and it's a bit of a catch-all, but I will say that $0.24, about half of that is usage, so call it $0.13 and that's because we have seen at least a little bit of softening in our non-weather sales performance. But it's interesting. I think the data that we highlighted are \u2013 effectively the last page of our supporting financial document is a touch misleading because it's weather-normalized, which is an imperfect science. And so just to go through the numbers, when it comes to non-weather sales we're about 0.5% down year-to-date, but remember not only is that math weather-normalized but it's also shown net of energy efficiency. And so if you think about the programs we have in place for energy efficiency, we're compensated to reduce customer usage about 1.5% from the prior year. And so if you gross up that 0.5% for the effects of energy efficiency, we're actually up about 1% percent. And then within the customer classes we actually see pretty favorable mix which has been the trend we've seen over the course of the first three quarters. So residential is up about 0.5%, again weather-normalized net of energy efficiency. And so when you gross that up, we're actually up about 2% year-to-date, and that's higher margin of course of our customer classes. Commercial is flat year-to-date and so if you gross that up, again we're up about 1.5%. And then admittedly the laggard has been industrial which is our lowest margin portion of customers and that's down over 2%, but grossing that up it's down about 0.5%. So I'd say industrial is the one place where we've underperformed and that's what you're seeing, and some of that customer usage, that's flowing through that $0.24. But even within that I think the key question you ask on the industrial side is, are underlying economic conditions in our service territory softening, and the quick answer to that is we don't believe so. We continue to see good economic factors in the Grand Rapids area which is in the heart of our service territory and I always look at the cycle billed sales particularly in our most energy intensive segments within again our electric service territory. So food manufacturing is up year-to-date about 9%, so that's trending quite well. Transportation equipment is up approximately 6% and then fabricated metal products is up over 4%. And so again some of our most energy intensive sectors within our service territory continuing to trend quite well and so I still think the economic conditions are quite good and so even though we've been a little disappointed in non-weather sales I think there's a nice comeback story and so we continue to do well and we expect the future will look quite bright as well. The other thing that's in that $0.24 and then I'll pause and breathe is that we have the absence of a tax benefit that we realized in Q3 of last year. That was about $0.07 and so that is obviously no longer flowing through and that's what's impacting the comp. So if you take the absence of the tax benefit coupled with non-weather sales, those two really represent the vast majority of that $0.24. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Great breakout and certainly good from a mix perspective when you talk about the different customer classes. My last question is the rate case filing coming up early next year. I believe you set a $245 million rate increase but with a bunch of offsets. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit of maybe what the total impact to customer bills might look like and how much of that comes from the lower commodity versus cost cuts versus whatever else might be in the plan? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah, so we're still finalizing the case but we do think obviously on a base rate perspective before you take into account the commodity costs you are going to see an increase in base rates. We're still working through that math. But when you do take the commodity costs into account we do think that you'll probably see a customer bill impact that may be a little higher than inflation case relative \u2013 for this case relative to the last case. But at the end of the day the impact on customers' bills particularly the residential level is about $2 per month or something of that zip code. So at the end of the day, not material increases for customers. And when you think about the benefits of those capital investments, as Patti highlighted we prioritize safety and reliability and so we do think it's certainly worth the cost to make sure that we're being very proactive in our pipeline maintenance as well as our vintage service programs and enhanced infrastructure replacement program. So we think the cost is certainly worth \u2013 first, we don't think the cost is a great deal, but we think the benefits certainly exceed the cost. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Sounds great. Thank you. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of BoA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Julien. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. So I wanted to follow back up on the IRP filing here and I know we've chatted about it a little bit. Just wanted to talk a little bit more with respect to, A, just logistically the timing of when you think in 2019 you'll come up with the next update. If I look, right, like the second quarter 2019 with an order there you would imagine you'd be in a position by third quarter to get an update there? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Julien, we'll see. I mean, obviously we expect to get a decision, we're going to get a decision within 10 months. So that will be in the April timeframe and then we get an opportunity to react to that and so we should get a resolution on the IRP in June of next year, but we'll also get some visibility prior to that. And so I don't want to sit and represent that we'll provide guidance on a new capital plan in Q3, maybe sooner than that and then we'll also have to see how things are progressing with our pending cases. And so I think it's a variety of things we'll have to see on the regulatory front that will dictate the timing. I would like to think it's Q3 at the latest, but it may be sooner than that. So we'll see. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. And can you elaborate a little bit more about some of the nuances of the IRP doc a little bit, maybe some of the changes and how you think about the needs assessment moving around. And I suppose, if you will, like any of the nuances that you'd be paying attention to there? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, we're very excited about the IRP, Julien. It's a great construct the way it's designed. So we filed the IRP this fall where, and as Rejji mentioned 10 months out we'll get early indicators from the Commission on the record and then we have 60 days to respond and we could make adjustments. What we filed in our IRP has very little financial impact in the first three years of the IRP. But it does include an important resolution to PURPA here in Michigan and setting of avoided costs per PURPA is important across the country. But the Commission has stated clearly and reiterated most recently that the IRP is the vehicle that they will use to establish a mechanism for setting avoided costs for PURPA qualifying facilities and for establishing whether a utility has a need, therefore qualifying facilities would be added to the system. And so our competitive bidding proposal combined with the financial compensation mechanism or earning on a PPA will get concrete feedback from the Commission through this filing and so we're looking forward to hearing that. The staff's position recently published shows support for the thinking. Of course there's a range in the financial compensation mechanism between the staff's position and our own, but that's not unlike a range in an ROE between the staff position and the company. There's a process and potentially a settlement on the table to be able to come to resolution on that issue. So we're excited about what it holds for Michigan and we're excited about the future because of what we've been able to publish through that IRP. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Right. And so I think I just heard it from you, you think you could settle that issue? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: It's possible. You know settlements are hard sometimes, particularly in this IRP there is a lot of parties, there is a lot of people engaged. I think we have a proven track record on settlements. But this one would be complicated, and frankly the 10-month time clock is just fine with us. And so I would say I wouldn't put in over or under on that. I would just suggest that we'll work toward a settlement, but if we can't get one we're very comfortable going to a Commission order on the IRP. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, excellent, all right. All the best, guys. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks a lot, Julien. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Julien. Operator : And our next question today comes from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Hi, Praful. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Praful. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. So again lots of questions answered which is great. I guess I wanted to touch on the weather impact and weather-normalized, clearly there is like on slide 8 I see $0.47 versus the $0.59 that you had with the weather benefit. I guess given the rising temperatures and the impact of just some form of continuous increase in heat, is the definition of weather-normalized something that will change, you think, over time and does that impact you guys at all if the assumption of load just changes given weather. Is that something you think about? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Well, certainly I have been critical in the past of just the calculation itself. I think as I've said before it's a very imperfect science to weather-normalize, but I don't think the work we do to weather-normalize our performance or across the sector will change anytime soon and obviously when it comes to planning we do plan for normal weather and when we say that, we look at the last 15 years and so we don't just take a couple of years, we look 15 years, over a decade, around a decade and a half of weather trends to make sure we're thinking the right way about our plans for the future and so you know, yes, we've been wrong and we've outperformed in some cases. In some cases, we've underperformed and that's what averages represent. And so, again, we feel like we have a pretty long-term point of view when it comes to weather normalization. And we'll try to be mindful of the near-term trends, but not overreact to them. Is that helpful, Praful? Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, no, that is. But I guess what I'm also thinking about is if the definition changes as and if the weather-normalized number just goes up over time, is that an impact to you guys from an earning potential perspective given the denominator that the regulators use to kind of define rates just goes up? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Praful, I would suggest that if you look back, you don't even have to go back as far as 2015 or 2014. You see dramatic weather differences, the opposite direction. So it really is not \u2013 I wouldn't suggest that average temperatures are rising. I would suggest that there is temperature variation and we can see that in our actual results over the last couple of years. You don't have to go far back to see a mild winter and a hot summer or a mild summer and a hot winter because we're gas and electric. Weather has a longer-term effect on us and sometimes evens itself out between the two commodities. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: And the only other thing I'd mention, Praful, is remember when we file our rate cases we do take into account sales forecasts and because of the nature or pace at which we file, which is really on a serial or annual basis, we do reflect our latest sales forecast. And so you just have that natural true-up or correcting mechanism every time we file rates and get rate orders. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. No, that's a great point. Thanks for that. And I guess just quickly, it won't be complete without a question on EnerBank. You already mentioned EnerBank is performing pretty well even through this at least uncertain time for banks. I guess, is there any view that if CapEx plans increase and the opportunity to grow the utility side increases, again, I'm just asking the strategic question, the fit on EnerBank and if that is something that would be considered at some point? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. As we've said before, Praful, EnerBank, nothing has changed with our point of view on EnerBank. It is in the same place that it has been. We don't put additional dollars into EnerBank itself growing and it plays its role in the system. Someone would have to pay the right price for us to sell EnerBank. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Fair enough. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you, guys. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Praful. Operator : And our next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller - Morningstar: Good morning. Thank you. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning, Travis. Travis Miller - Morningstar: I was wondering on the electric case, you talked about the settlement and possibility of IRP. What about a settlement possibility in the electric case and how far apart do you think you are in terms of reaching a middle point for a possible settlement. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: So we have been having, in fact I think we have another iteration today and so we've had very productive settlement discussions to date. And when we think about the numbers where we are right now, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're at $44 million of deficiency. That presupposes a 10.75% ROE, the staff's at almost a $100 million difference at $44 million sufficiency. And so when you think about that delta of $100 million, it seems like you could drive a truck through it. But if you normalize for ROE and just go to the current ROE and I'm not conceding that 10.75% is not what we think the ROE should be, but let's just say you hypothetically do that math, you close the gap about $60 million. And then if you take capital structure into account, we're at 52.5%, I think the staff is just under 52% and kind of normalize that to where it is currently across gas and electric, that gives you another almost $10 million. And so you normalize for current ROEs and current capital structures, you close the gap pretty materially and so because of that, we are cautiously optimistic that there could -- that we could settle but as Patti highlighted in the context of the IRP, any of the electric-related proceedings are quite complicated, there are a lot of moving pieces and there are a lot of interveners and so we are cautiously optimistic but much too early to spike the football at this point so we'll see where we go. Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. Great. And then you talked a little bit here about regulatory outcomes in the near term could impact your capital spend outlook. What is that kind of if you get a good decision, what does that mean? If you get a bad decision, what does that mean just in terms of range of potential capital plans over the 5-year or 10-year period? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Yeah. So I think the absolute amount of capital investments we have whether it's 5 or 10 years, I think that we'll certainly on a five-year basis remain consistent and so right now we're kind of just over $10 billion across the next 5 years. What will change as a result of regulatory outcomes is potentially the composition of that quantum of capital that we plan to invest over the timeframe and so for example if we see \u2013 I don't foresee this, but let's say we get a gas outcome that we view as suboptimal, well then that may increase our emphasis on some of our renewable investments or potential electric distribution investments and vice versa. And so it really is a function of how we're trending on the various regulatory fronts which could change the composition of the capital investment program but not so much the quantum. And then as I think longer term, then obviously the quantum could expand as I highlighted earlier and so we think we'll certainly be above the $18 billion, 10-year plan that we proposed in our September of 2017 investor conference and so that number will come up, will go up, but again it's a function of how we trend in the longer-term items such as trackers, the IRP and so on. Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay, great. Appreciate it. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Vedula Murti of Avon Capital. Please go ahead. Vedula Murti - Avon Capital : Good morning. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Good morning. Vedula Murti - Avon Capital : I apologize if you addressed this. You may have, I think, in your discussion with Julien, but what's your current feeling about the prospects within the IRP process to achieve the type of tracker that you've been seeking? As I recall, I think the initial staff testimony was not particularly supportive of what you were requesting if I'm correct about that? If you could please address that? Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: So, Vedula, are you referring to a tracker or is it \u2013 because we don't really have a tracker embedded in our IRP, is it some other aspect of the IRP (00:53:51)? Vedula Murti - Avon Capital : Oh, then, I apologize if it is outside the IRP, I was referring specifically to the tracker, capital tracker. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: The five-year.... Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Maybe you're describing the five-year distribution tracker we filed for in our electric rate case? Vedula Murti - Avon Capital : Yes. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: So, again as Rejji was just describing, we're working towards a settlement on that. There is \u2013 we've had a lot of regulatory filings in Michigan as a result of the energy law in 2016, not necessarily rate filings, but regulatory proceedings and so there has been a desire to find a way to go in less often. And so we offered to stay out of rate cases for a couple of years with the implementation of this long-term tracker on our distribution system. It's a $3 billion proposal. That's a pretty big ask for the Commission to approve all of that spending. So we're not, I wouldn't put my bets on getting that full tracker approved. The staff has expressed our concerns about that full tracker, but perhaps a portion of it much like our gas, in our gas cases, we have an enhanced infrastructure replacement program tracking mechanism and that has worked out very well. It allows us to do longer term contracts with our contract providers. We're able to do a work plan that's more robust and reliable. We can eliminate waste in the system because we can plan ahead more effectively. So we're a fan of that kind of tracking mechanism. And we think that the detail provided in our five-year distribution plan was sufficient to support and maybe a portion, maybe it would be substation maintenance or maybe pole replacements or something like that as a first step toward longer term getting to a full capital tracker. But certainly we support the idea of the full capital tracker, but I wouldn't expect that it will fully be approved. But just keep in mind that just means that we continue to come in annually like we do. We have good outcomes from our regulatory filings and we're continuously improving our quality of those filings and we've seen good outcomes, and we feel good about going in annually if we need to, to make sure that we can make the necessary investments on behalf of our customers, and pass along cost savings that we realize throughout the year. Vedula Murti - Avon Capital : So you seem to be expecting that you could achieve a portion of this, but that it would still entail probably coming in annually as you have been? Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yes. Vedula Murti - Avon Capital : Okay. Thank you. Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.: Thank you. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Yes. Thank you. Operator : And this includes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mrs. Patti for any closing remarks. Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.: Thanks, Rocco. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us this morning. I wish you all have a very safe Halloween. And we look forward to seeing you at EEI. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The CMS Energy 2018 Year-End Earnings Call. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy\u2019s website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at noon Eastern Time running through February 7th. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy\u2019s website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Sri Maddipati : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Patti. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Sri, and good morning, everyone. Before I review our results for the year, I do want to touch on what you\u2019ve likely heard in the media. Michigan and the Midwest are experiencing extremely cold temperatures, which are attacking energy delivery throughout myself and driving record demand on our gas system. The Governor of Michigan has declared a state of emergency given the dangerously cold weather. Our number one priority is to keep people safe and warm. We\u2019ve seen record demand on our system, and while we are working hard to meet that demand, we did have an incident at our Ray storage field, which is now partially back online. But given the weather and demand, we have asked our customers to reduce their gas usage by turning down thermostats and conserving energy across the state. We thank all of our customers who are doing their part to help Michigan crews in dangerous weather, which we expect to last for the next 24 hours. 2018 was a solid year for CMS which Rejji and I will walk through in great detail in addition to sharing the Company\u2019s 2019 goals with the usual emphasis on the triple bottom line. With another year in the books, we\u2019re pleased to report adjusted earnings of $2.33 per share, which is toward the top end of our guidance range as planned. Building on those results, we have raised our 2019 full year guidance range from $2.46 to $2.50 per share, up by a penny to $2.47 to $2.51. This reflects growth of 6% to 8% on top of actuals, as we do every year with a bias toward the midpoint of 7%. It\u2019s also worth noting that earlier this month, the Board voted to increase our 2019 annual dividend to $1.53 per share, a 7% increase year-over-year, which was in line with our earnings growth. And we are reaffirming our long-term dividend growth plans as being in line with our earnings growth. As we look back at 2018, Slide 5 serves as a great snapshot of our triple bottom line in action as we worked hard for our people, our planet and our investors. In fact, we were able to reduce customers\u2019 bills by more than $160 million as a result of tax reform and provided over $10 million to our most vulnerable customers to help them pay their bills. We also released our clean energy goal and filed our integrated resource plan or IRP that firmly solidified our promise to care for our planet by eliminating coal as a fuel source and producing over 40% of our energy from renewables at the utility by 2040 with up to 6,000 megawatts of new solar and reducing our carbon emissions by more than 90% during the same period. We also expanded our renewable portfolio at enterprises with 105 megawatt wind PPA with General Motors and a 24-megawatt solar project for the municipality in Lansing, Michigan. And our triple bottom line is underpinned by our coworkers\u2019 performance operationally. We had a busy year, as we\u2019ve replaced over 13,000 vintage gas service line. We also spent a record amount on forestry at our electric business improving both the safety and reliability of our system. These achievements and others listed on this slide would not be possible without our investors, both large and small. We\u2019ve entrusted with us their savings and we thank them for that. Without the broad access to cost effective capital from our investors, we would not be able to make the necessary investments to provide safe and reliable energy to our customers. As we entered 2019, we\u2019re now laser focused on delivering for our customers and investors in the current year and preparing for 2020 and beyond. I can tell you safety is top of mind this year and that as it was last year and the year before that. From boots on the ground to safety in the office, every meeting and every job begins with, what we call, a safety tailboard. All potential hazards are discussed before the job begins and necessary precautions are addressed each day. That may seem simple and may be not that important. I can assure you creating and improving a safety culture requires daily attention and all of us here take that very seriously. Beyond that, we are planning to invest over $100 million more than the prior year and improving safety in both our gas and electric systems, so that our co-workers and customers are safe. This year, we will continue to focus on enhancing our customers\u2019 experience through targeted programs, increasing economic growth in our home state and protecting our planet, all while staying focused on our commitment to investors to deliver the financial results you\u2019ve come to expect. Our priorities are enabled by our implementation of the Consumers Energy Way which allows us to see and eliminate waste in all of our processes. Slide 7 highlights our success in attracting new businesses in Michigan. In 2018, we proactively saw and attracted 101-megawatt to load. This is up from 69 megawatts in 2017. This load growth includes key wins from large Internet-based retailers, dairy manufacturing farms and many other industries that chose to bring their business to our state and trusted us to meet their energy needs. We\u2019re proud of these wins and the associated economic growth that they offer including over 5,500 new jobs and $2 billion of investment in our home state just last year. We will also highlight that less than 2% of our customer contributions are from the auto industry, leaving us less vulnerable to any one sector of the economy. And we know that when Michigan grows, CMS Energy grows. And we will continue to support economic development that will diversify our customer base. As we continue to focus on delivering safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers, our performance is further enabled by our energy law, which provides a constructive regulatory framework and supports a forward-thinking energy policy. Today, we have an open seat at the commission as Rachael Eubanks has been appointed to State Treasurer by our new Governor. We\u2019d like to take this opportunity to congratulate the former Commissioner Eubanks and wish her great success as Treasurer of Michigan. I have no doubt that she\u2019s going to do a great job. We expect the Governor, Whitmer, will appoint a new Commissioner soon with two seats currently filled at the Commission. We do have a quorum as evidenced by the recent approval of our electric settlement in early January, and we look forward to working with the administrations pending the point he wants publicized and whoever replaces Commissioner Saari in July, when his term is scheduled to expire. As we look ahead to the regulatory calendar over the next couple of years, you will see less rate cases given that we managed and settled excessive gas and electric rate cases to close out 2018. The electric rate case outcome was particularly noteworthy since it occurred eight months after our filings and it\u2019s only the second time in our Company\u2019s recent history that we have settled an electric rate case. The highlight of the settlement includes $200 million for reliability investment, that\u2019s $70 million more than ever before plus the ability to true-up costs related to CapEx spending in new business for demand failures and asset relocations. This settlement allows us to avoid filing a new rate case until 2020. Our IRP filing is on track for a final order in the second quarter. We anticipate an order in our demand response filing and our final piece of tax reform related to deferred taxes in the second half of this year. Lastly, in November, we filed our gas rate case for $229 million at 10.75% ROE with a 12-month test period ending September 2020. This rate case will focus heavily on safety, as we look to replace around the 140 miles of main and 25,000 vintage services among other gas investments. The weather we\u2019ve been experiencing further highlights the need to continue to invest in our gas system to ensure safety and reliability. We expect a commission order by September of this year. As we turn to Slide 10, we\u2019re reminded of the work that our team does every day to adapt changing condition. As you can see, in 2018, we benefited from weather and we put those dollars back to work, which derisk 2019. We were able to leverage the early favorability to benefit our customers very effectively in the calendar year. If we experience poor weather and significant storm activity in 2019, we will rely on those pull aheads from the prior year, our lean operating system and our ability to optimize work to maximize safety and reliability for the benefit to customers. This strategy allows us to deliver on our financial objectives in the current year while providing a longer runway for our growth in the future. As Slide 11 shows, we\u2019ve proven our ability to deliver regardless of who is in office to make up of the commission for varying weather or economic conditions. I have said it before, the part of what makes us consistent is our ability to adapt changing external conditions, and we look forward to working with Governor, Whitmer, and the Commission to serve our friends and neighbors. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned, we\u2019re pleased to announce our strong results for 2018 with adjusted earnings per share of $2.33, up 7% in 2017 and towards the high end of our guidance as we\u2019ve predicted. Our adjusted EPS largely excludes modest non-recurring costs associated with select legal legacy business matters and federal tax reform, which resulted in a net difference of $0.01 per share between our adjusted and GAAP EPS. As is often the case, we do not carve out much and take the good with the bad with no excuses. Our 2018 results were largely driven by weather and rate relief net investments of the utility, as highlighted on the right hand side of Page 12, which were partially offset by substantial reinvestment activity or pull aheads as we refer to them particularly in the fourth quarter. We had adjusted earnings of $0.40 per share for 2018 compared to $0.51 per share in the Q4 2017. In addition to a record level of operating pull ahead in 2018 of the utility, we also capitalize on non-operating pull aheads by prefunding multiple debt tranches at the parent which is a key driver of the negative variance in our parent and other expense versus guidance. As Patti noted, the numerous reinvestment actions taken in 2018 benefit our customers by enhancing service and reducing costs, while serving to derisk our 2019 financial plan to benefit investors, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail shortly. Closing the books on 2018, Slide 13 lists all of our financial targets for the year and our success in achieving them. I\u2019ll highlight a couple of noteworthy items in addition to achieving 7% annual EPS growth. We grew our dividend commensurately and generated over $1.7 billion of operating cash flow, which exceeded our guidance and was roughly flat with the prior year as anticipated, due to the effects of federal tax reform. Our steady cash flow generation and conservative financing strategy over the years continues to fortify our balance sheet as evidenced by our strong FFO/debt ratio, which is at approximately 18.5% at year-end and also exceeded our expectations. It is worth noting that our outperformance for FFO to debt was in part driven by the prescribed pace which the benefits the federal tax reform when corporate entry, which enables us to issue less equity than we initially anticipated in 2018. Lastly, in accordance with our self-funding model, we kept annual customer price increases below inflation for both the gas and electric businesses, all while investing a record level of capital of approximately $2 billion at the utility. Moving to 2019, as Patti highlighted, we\u2019re increasing both the bottom and top end of our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance, $2.47 and $2.51, which implies 6% to 8% annual growth of our actuals for 2018. Unsurprisingly, we expect the utility to drive the vast majority of our consolidated financial performance, and we continue to target the midpoint of the EPS growth rate of 7%. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2019 EPS guidance range, as you will note on the waterfall chart on Slide 15, we plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.27 negative year-over-year variance given the better-than-normal weather experienced in 2018. However, as I highlighted in our third quarter call, we have largely mitigated that headwind with the substantial reinvestment activity that we exercised in 2018. More specifically, we made a number of discretionary pull aheads in 2018 that we do not need to repeat in 2019. The operational and financial flexibility afforded by these efforts coupled with our usual level of expected cost performance did result in a $0.27 positive year-over-year variance which fully offsets the absence of the favorable 2018 weather. And while we\u2019re on this topic, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t take a moment to thank all of our coworkers for their hard work throughout 2018. While the customer and financial benefits and pull aheads are relatively easy to identify, what\u2019s often underappreciated is the organizational burden that pull aheads create since we don\u2019t usually outsource incremental work and our coworkers effectively doubled their efforts to get this work done. As mentioned, we have mitigated some of our regulatory risk in 2019 with positive outcomes in the early settlements of our previous electric and gas cases. We also have a pending gas case as Patti noted, which in order is due in late September. Keep in mind we are showing the net pickup after the impacts of investment-related costs such as depreciation, property tax and interest expense. We have also embedded the usual conservatism in our assumptions around the sales and financing activity. Please refer to appendix Slide 25 on EPS and OCF sensitivity analysis, unsaid variables among others. As you can see, due to our significant reinvestment activity in 2018 and the constructive regulatory environment, we have a reasonable path to deliver another year of 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth. Our focus on cost controls, conservative financial planning and proactive risk management underpin our simple but unique business model depicted on Slide 16, which enables us to deliver consistent industry-leading financial performance year-end and year-out. We have a robust backlog of capital investments, which improves the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems for our customers and drives earnings growth for our investors. We fund this growth largely through cost cutting, tax planning, economic development and modest non-utility contribution, all efforts, which we deem sustainable in the long run. As such, we are confident that we can continue to improve customer experience through capital investments while meeting our affordability and environmental targets for many years to come. As you can see on Slide 17, we have updated our five-year customer investment plan by rolling it forward one year, as we often do on our Q4 call. This adds an additional $1 billion of capital investment, bringing the five-year plan to $11 billion in aggregate, roughly half of which is comprised of gas infrastructure investments. We continue to focus on the needs of our aging gas system. As reflected in the forecast, increase in gas as a percentage of total rate base from 30% to 40% over the next five years, which drives over 7% rate base growth. Please note the annual details of this plan are included in the appendix of this presentation. Our capital investment needs remain significant beyond the five-year period as well. As we work through regulatory proceedings in our financial planning cycle, we expect that the longer-term capital mix will continue to evolve. And we look forward to providing an update to our 10-year capital plan in the second half of the year once we have better visibility on the long-term capacity plan for the outcome of our IRP. As we highlighted in past, the primary constraint on the pace, which we invest capital is customer affordability. And we are confident that we can continue to deliver cost reductions to minimize customer bill increases. Our numerous capital investment programs will enable reduced maintenance costs on items such as service restoration, leak repair and meter reading among other benefits. We will also benefit from power purchase agreements rolling off in due time, while also realizing fuel and O&M expense savings as we retire our coal fleet. Speaking of the coal fleet, I am pleased to report that we have recently renegotiated our fuel transportation rates, which will yield over $150 million in customers savings customer savings cumulatively over the life of the new contracts. We also continue to seek out non-operating cost savings opportunities. In addition to over $1.2 billion of opportunistic refinancings collectively at the parent and utility in 2018, we contributed $240 million into our pension plan in late December to increase the funded status of our pension plans to approximately 90%. This sizable discretionary contribution coupled with prudent decisions of the past such as closing our defined benefit plan several years ago, utilizing conservative asset return expectations, employing a balanced asset allocation strategy among others, has more than offset the unfavorable asset performance experienced in 2018. In fact, we are estimating about $6 million reduction in our pension expense in 2019 versus 2018 as noted in the appendix. To put our strong cost controls into perspective, on the right hand side of the slide, you will note that our residential electric and gas bills have decreased on an absolute basis and as a percent of wallet for Michigan residents from 2007 to 2017 despite nearly $15 billion of capital investment over that time frame. Looking now at our operating cash flow forecast on Slide 19, as mentioned, we received some upside in OCF in 2018, due to the pace which the benefits of federal tax reform were incorporated into rates. And some are O&M, we took measures to derisk our 2019 plan, most notably through the aforementioned pension contribution and solid working capital management. As such, we continue to target $1.65 billion of OCF in 2019 and still anticipate a $100 million per year increase beginning in 2020. In aggregate, we are forecasted to generate over $9 billion of cumulative operating cash flow over the next five years, which will play key role in the financing strategy of our five-year capital plan. In support of our liquidity planning, we also expect to avoid paying meaningful federal taxes through 2023. This is the result of strong tax planning and the forecast layering in of renewable tax credit as we meet the 15% RPS standard in Michigan by 2021. And some are forecasted OCF generation coupled with our tax shield portfolio enables us to continue to finance our capital investment program in a highly cost efficient manner as you will note on Slide 30 in the appendix. On Slide 20, you will note that we have refreshed the outlook for DIG to reflect positive new developments in our energy contracts. In short, we have successfully amended and extended our existing energy contracts and entered into a new contract at our simple cycle unit in Kalamazoo. The revenue associated with these contract revisions has allowed us to weather the challenges presented by lower capacity prices and we\u2019ve reflected this in our guidance for 2019 and our plan going forward. As you can see, DIG is almost fully contracted for energy and capacity through 2022. So we feel quite good about maintaining the $35 million pre-tax income run rate. Also if capacity prices were to revert back to recent history, around $3 per kilowatt-month that we could see an additional $10 million to $15 million of upside. Alternatively, as the market were to tighten the levels comparable and MISO Cost of New Entry, or CONE due to looming coal retirements or the establishment of the local clearing requirement and this opportunity can more than double. Suffice it to say, the enterprise team has done an excellent job of managing risk and reducing the beta in their portfolio for the foreseeable future. On Slide 21, we have listed our financial targets for 2019 and beyond. In short, we anticipate another solid year of 6% to 8% EPS growth with a bias toward the midpoint. This model has and will continue to serve our customers, well, as they see affordable electric and gas prices from our self-funding strategy as well as our investors who can continue to count on consistent industry-leading financial performance. As we look prospectively at the consolidated business, our EPS growth continues to be driven by our utility given its robust capital investment needs and forward-looking filings such as the IRP and forward-looking filings, excuse me, such as the IRP provide long-term transparency for key stakeholders, which should provide more visibility regarding regulatory outcomes in the future. Outside the utility, we\u2019ll continue to operate our enterprises business with a low-risk mindset. When we couple our earnings contribution with contracted non-utility growth and prudent financial planning, you can see why we have confidence in our ability to continue to grow at 6% to 8% over the long term. With that, Allison, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Jonathan. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : And thank you for the update and good luck getting the \u2013 keeping everyone warm out there. Patti Poppe : Given our best. Jonathan Arnold : Just a quick \u2013 just Rejji, this might be for you, but I think you\u2019ve given us quite the granularity on timing of spend by segment, at least not recently. So can you perhaps help us see where the $1 billion of incremental electric investment installing, it looks like 2020 and 2021 are the peak spend years. But I\u2019m just not sure what those were before. Rejji Hayes : Happy to do that. Yes, so you\u2019re right, we do crossed over the five-year period in 2021 and that has a lot to do with the renewables and the trajectors and giving them timing of the tax credits. But if you look at the $11 billion in our new five-year plan versus the $10 billion in our prior vintage, the real difference is, one, you\u2019ve got about $0.25 billion of renewables flowing through our electric supply spend and that again is the gas to the 15% RPS. And then you\u2019ve got about a commensurate increase in electric distribution and gas infrastructure and as we roll forward one year. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s a combination of those three things. Incremental renewables, electric distribution spend as we roll our five-year distribution plan one year forward and then an uptick in gas infrastructure spend. So it\u2019s really those three things, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : So the revenue \u2013 I feel the renewables \u2013 $1 billion of renewables was already in the plan \u2013 the prior plan. Rejji Hayes : We had it close to those levels. I\u2019d say we were probably about $0.25 billion south. We were in that zip code, but at the end of the day, we wanted to make sure that the renewables we had in the prior plan and this plan reflected what we\u2019re seeing in our renewable energy plans that we filed in the RFPs. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. And it\u2019s a similar topic, last quarter, I think you said you were planning to give an update to the 10-year view on capital late \u2013 sometime later this year, you still think you\u2019ll do that and any sense of timing and what you\u2019re specifically waiting for before you do it. Rejji Hayes : Yes. So we would foresee rolling out a new 10-year plan by the second half of this year as we mentioned in Q3 and prior to that, I think I mean the real gating item is, we see it, is the IRP. And so we\u2019re going to get most likely a preliminary point of view from the commission in April of this year. We get 60 days to respond to that. And so that will most likely play itself out by midyear at which point we\u2019ll have better visibility on our electric supply spend over the next 10 years, particularly in those outer years, because that\u2019s when you start to see a ramp-up of, I\u2019ll say, renewables-related spend. So that\u2019s a key data point. And at the end of the day, we also have to spend a good deal of timing internally making sure that we can solve the customer affordability equation and would be irresponsible to roll out a capital plan that we couldn\u2019t when I say we, our customers and/or our balance sheet couldn\u2019t afford. And so we want to get all of that math right before we roll it out. I can say with great confidence that the 18 billion that we rolled out in the prior vintage in September of 2017 is well stale and we expect it to be higher than that, but want to spend some more time figuring out how much higher. Jonathan Arnold : I mean, would it be reasonable to think it would be more than double the five-year plan given the need to kind of \u2013 the compounding effects? Rejji Hayes : It\u2019s premature to guide you at this point. We had said that, we think there\u2019s about a $3 billion capital investment opportunity in the IRP in the outer years. And so we would feel pretty comfortable saying that we will likely be included in the new plan. And also we\u2019ve talked about this sensitivity in the past, where basically every $60 million or 1% reduction we can achieve in rates creates about $400 million of incremental capital investment capacity. And so if you think about our PPAs rolling off, if you think about some of the cost savings we expect as we retire the coal fleet over time on O&M and fuel side, we do think it\u2019s going to create substantial headroom to accommodate additional spend. So I\u2019d hate to guide you at this point and give you a directional number, but we think it will certainly be in excess of $18 billion. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. One final thing, how certain are you guys, you\u2019ll need to file another electric case in 2020? Is there a chance to get under the settlement you could potentially go longer? Patti Poppe : I think given the needs of the system, it\u2019s likely that we will file in 2020, Jonathan. We have the settlement this year. We\u2019re so happy about it, because it does enable certainty in our reliability spend and we don\u2019t have to trade off with some of the other more variable programs that often compete for the capital dollars on reliability, because we have this new regulatory mechanism, but it isn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t sell for a full tracker. We do think there is a basis in this settlement for a tracker in the future, but we know that there is significant electric investment required and our cost effectiveness is captured there. So we think that we will definitely be filing in 2020. Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thank you very much, guys. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Our next question will come from Greg Gordon of Evercore. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good morning. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Greg. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon : Couple questions. I was just a tad late hopping on the call and I just missed hearing the rollup of the actuals for 2018 and you had commented that there was a reason as to why the corporate overheads came in higher than initially budgeted. What was that if you wouldn\u2019t mind restating that, please? Rejji Hayes : Yes, happy to, Greg. It was largely due to the significant amount of reinvestment activity both in the operating and non-operating sides. So in corporate, you\u2019re going to have some of the non-operating related spend embedded in that. And so we took out at least two tranches of parent-related debt prematurely in 2018, $100 million remaining from our eight and three-quarter notes and then $300 million of the six handle note around midyear. And so a lot of those upfront costs flow through the corporate and other expense. Greg Gordon : Okay. I know you\u2019ve been just refinancing at a lower rate, or are you diffusing that debt permanently? Rejji Hayes : Combination of both. Greg Gordon : Okay. And so I guess I wonder why\u2026 Rejji Hayes : Hang on, to be clear, sorry, just to circle back here, when you say diffusing, do you mean just taking out altogether... Greg Gordon : Were you paying off or are you refinancing it? Rejji Hayes : No, we\u2019re refinancing, just to be clear. So we\u2019re extending maturities at a much lower cost. Greg Gordon : Okay. I guess what\u2019s driving the \u2013 if that\u2019s sort of a one-time expense to prepay the debt, what\u2019s driving the assumption of a flat corporate overhead number this year? Rejji Hayes : Well, the reality is we\u2019ve been so proactive over the last several years in taking out, I\u2019ll say, high coupon bonds that there really are too many opportunities left in the portfolio. So credit to Sri and his team for their wonderful prefunding efforts, but if you look at the rest of portfolio both of the parent and the operating company, you really see four and five handles and I don\u2019t think we have maybe one six-handle left, but we\u2019ve done a nice job. So, I don\u2019t foresee too many opportunities to prefund at attractive level. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019re being fairly conservative in the year-over-year corporate. Greg Gordon : Okay. And then my second question was your FFO to debt came in at 18.5% for 2018, you\u2019ve told us the expectation is that\u2019s going to be around 17% in 2019. What\u2019s driving that delta? And do you expect movement in your FFO to debt metrics post 2019 up or down in any meaningful way? Rejji Hayes : Yeah, I would say it\u2019s a couple of things. And so first, we talked about the prescribed pace at which the effects of tax reform are being passed onto customers and so we initially assumed at the beginning of 2018 that we have an outflow around, call, roughly $200 million and that\u2019s both sort of credits A and B to reflect the reduction in the current rate that flows through base rates from 35% down to 21%. And then we thought there may be resolution on the deferred tax-related refund to customers. That obviously has \u2013 was a little bit too aggressive in assumption. And so the fully adjudicated process will extend well into 2019. And so we had about, I\u2019ll say, $150 million of upside from an OCF perspective in 2018, because the outflows back to customers did not occur during this year. Now, there is no P&L effect. But there certainly is a cash flow impact. So we expect there will be a headwind in the form of giving those dollars back to customers in 2019. And so that\u2019s, I\u2019d say, the largest source of the variance year-over-year. And then what you also see, two, is just the reality, as we\u2019re increasing our annual run rate for capital investments. So we\u2019re going from $2 billion a year at the utility to $2.25 billion and so funding that also has credit metric implications and we also still assuming, that the equity, ratio at the utility is at that sort of 52.5% level. And so that\u2019s going to require infusions from the parent down there. And we do debt fund a portion of that. And so that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving us to that 18.5% or thereabouts down to, what I\u2019ll say is approximately 17% in 2019. And we expect to stay at that level for the foreseeable future. Is that helpful? Greg Gordon : That\u2019s extremely helpful. Thank you. Have a great day. Rejji Hayes : You too, Greg. Take care. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hi, good morning, guys. So could you talk a little bit about the equity issuance needs of $150 million a year? I guess that\u2019s a long-term plan and how that differs from the $70 million, like what\u2019s the increment between those two? Rejji Hayes : Yeah, sure. So similar to what I described in terms of the variance in our FFO to debt metrics year-over-year, it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s few things, Michael. It\u2019s again the increase in our capital spend rate. So our run rate historically has been about $2 billion or at least over the last couple of years and now will be at $2.25 billion with an increase in the new five-year vintage of $11 billion in total. So assuming about $2.25 billion per year at the utility. So that\u2019s going to drive our sort of leverage-related needs and our equity needs as well. And then again we\u2019re assuming that our equity component of our rate-making capital structure will stay at 52.5%. And so that\u2019s going to lead to fairly substantial equity infusions from the parent into the utility, most of which we fund with equity issuances. And so you have a couple things there. And then the other reality is to in 2018 again, we did not have a significant an outflow for tax reform back to customers as we had anticipated and so we didn\u2019t issue as much equity in 2018. And so some of that will flow into future years. And so we assume again we\u2019re going to \u2013 run rate will be about $150 million per year of planned equity issuance. We will be proactive about that as we can. So we did a good deal of forwards in the fourth quarter of last year, while we thought our stock was at a relatively attractive price and so we\u2019ve taken a lot of the price risk off the table in 2019 and we\u2019ll see where we end up going forward, but we think that that\u2019s a reasonable level if you\u2019re doing $150 million per year and you look at that as a percentage of market cap, we definitely think that that\u2019s doable in an ATM program. Michael Weinstein : Got you. And looking at the DIG slide, in the old slides, right, you had $75 million opportunity from a $7.50 capacity price getting out into the future and now it looks like it\u2019s $95. Is there \u2013maybe I just misunderstood why that I don\u2019t know if you explain that before. Maybe could you explain it again? Rejji Hayes : No, I mean the math that we have, it really is looking at just the potential opportunity that you would have. If you have either a local clearing requirement established in Michigan and we stink the jury quite literally is still out on that, or just given the tightening we expect in the bilateral capacity markets as you see inevitable coal retirements in the zone 7 and throughout the region and so the math is basically rolled forward a year. We\u2019re assuming somewhere around $7.50 and that coupled with the extension and amendment of existing energy contracts with some of our big contracts. DIG is really what\u2019s fueling a little bit of that incremental upside, but needless to say, we have not incorporated that into our plan. We are assuming what you see on the page here for 2019 about a run rate of $35 million of pre-tax income that we think will last for the foreseeable future. And as you probably noted in the table above, we really have derisked the portfolio a good deal, by amending and extending energy contracts and selling forward capacity fairly ratably over the last several months. Michael Weinstein : So a lot of the upside \u2013 or a lot of the benefits, reason why it\u2019s more stable for energy, there\u2019s energy contracting, even though the capacity pricing has been softer. Rejji Hayes : That\u2019s right. Michael Weinstein : That\u2019s reasonable. Okay. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. This is actually Eric on for Julian. But I just wanted to ask if you could discuss progress on the IRP filing thus far, and what could drive further confidence in renewables spend beyond that $1 billion IRP through 2021 in the current plan, specifically with the remainder of the solar ITC safe harbor period in 2022 and 2023 ? Thank you. Patti Poppe : Hey, good morning, Eric. We\u2019re making good progress in the IRP, as I\u2019m sure everyone knows where the first IRP to be filed and process here in Michigan. The hard work that we did to get lots of stakeholder input before we filed has made for very constructive discussions throughout the process, because it is a complicated process. We are planning on it and going to its full regulatory timeline, which would be first preliminary order from the commission in April and then a final order in June. And we\u2019re looking forward to working through the remainder of that process. To your question about additional renewables to the plan, what we have in the plan right now reflects no additional incremental renewables as a result of the IRP that would be premature to do before we have a final order in that. So right now, what we have built into the plan is meeting the renewable portfolio standard through our RAP. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. And then just regarding 2022 and 2023, presumably I know you mentioned customer affordability type of equation, if you were to have supportive IRP result, could we potentially see incremental renewables spend in 2022 and 2023 supported by, say, lower fuel cost replacement and whatnot? Patti Poppe : You know the driver for the renewables is demand on the system and what\u2019s required both to meet the law, but also to meet the needs of customers for their demand for energy. There is \u2013 we do \u2013 we have published our time line of retirements of our coal plants and we also do have the retirement of the PPAs, but in the 2023 time horizon. The power of sales PPA that comes off doesn\u2019t require additional capacity to backfill it. We\u2019ve replaced it with energy efficiency, demand response and other sources in the short run. So I don\u2019t think that would drive incremental renewables in that time horizon. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you. Good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Ali. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha : Good morning. First question, just looking at your quarterly disclosure on weather-normalized sales. On the electric side, I mean the electric sales weather normalized were negative in three of the last four quarters, ended up negative for the year. Just wondering what\u2019s kind of driving that and can you just remind us what you assumed for weather-normalized electric sales going forward ? Rejji Hayes : Sure, Ali. I will not try to spend too much time on the soapbox around the imperfections and shortcomings of weather normalized math, but I do think that is flowing through the numbers, particularly if you take into account the stark contrast between weather in 2017 and 2018. So I would start there, but then as you look at just numbers that are on the page putting that aside. And so we are approximately 0.5% down blended for electric for 2018 and it\u2019s really important to note that that customer usage level reflects our efforts to reduce customer usage year-over-year through energy efficiency, where we get compensated to do that. And so we\u2019ve been at this for now about 10 years if you go back to the prior Energy Law in 2008, and so now it\u2019s a 1.5% bogey, and we expect to clear that and we\u2019ve cleared it the last year and we expect to clear it this year as well and so you\u2019ll see that flowing through 2018. So what does that mean. So when you\u2019re negative 0.5% on a blended basis for electric, if your gross it up, you\u2019re about 1% for electric and so we still think that on a normalized load basis is comparable to what most folks are seeing across the country. And then if you peel the onion a little bit and you look at residential, it was down about 0.3%. So you gross that up, you\u2019re up over 1%. Commercial was up about 0.3%. Again, gross that up, you\u2019re down over \u2013 you\u2019re up a little under 2%. And so we still see pretty good trends there and I think what\u2019s also important to notice that, if you look at the economic conditions in our service territory, they still remain quite good, and so we always point to Grand Rapids, that\u2019s in the heart of our electric service territory and you pick a metric whether it\u2019s GDP, unemployment, population growth, building permits, all of those statistics are trending better than the national average. And so we continue to feel quite good about the economic conditions in our service territory. So, yes, the numbers I think on the surface may appear a little suboptimal, but again we think there\u2019s a lot more to it. You asked about going forward, we assume roughly flat over the planned period at the utility, again, weather normalized and net of energy efficiency. So, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re \u2013 our expectations are relatively tempered and then the IRP, which spans over a longer period, we\u2019re assuming about a quarter of a percent. So, again we plan very conservatively. And the last thing, I\u2019ll say, is we also aren\u2019t reactive when it comes to normalized load growth expectations. We have very prosperous economic development programs and Patty highlighted in your planned remarks that we hit 100 megawatts in 2018, up from 69 megawatts the prior year and so we really feel like we\u2019re doing all we can to support economic development and our service territory certainly relative to other service territories across the country looks quite good. Ali Agha : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Second question, perhaps for Patti as well, I mean you\u2019ve got a new Governor obviously in place now. By the middle of the year, you will have two new Commissioners out of three. Just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the regulatory framework in the state? And do you expect any changes once all of this is settled going forward? Patti Poppe : Well, we are looking forward to learning the Governor\u2019s plans on our current open position at the commission with Commissioner Saari and Commissioner Talberg there, that\u2019s six more months of that quorum, and with the addition then of a new Commissioner, we look forward to that appointment. I would say that one of the strengths of the Michigan regulatory environment is that it\u2019s captured in the statute and so our energy law that was passed originally in 2008 and then further improved in 2016 provides a lot of continuity in regulatory planning. And so we do have a great working relationship with the new Governor, many of her staffs are people we\u2019ve worked within the past and so we\u2019re quite optimistic that she\u2019ll make great appointments to the commission and we\u2019ll look forward to working with them, and like our track record has been independent of Commissioner changes, Governor changes, economic changes, weather changes, we have the core capability of adapting to those changing conditions. We have a lot of confidence in our ability to adjust and adapt as necessary. Ali Agha : Okay. And lastly kind of related to that, my understanding is through because of term limits, there has been a fair amount of turnover in the legislature as well. As you look out over this session or even beyond, anything in particular for us to keep an eye on, or that you\u2019re keeping an eye on anything that could either tweak or change the energy law in any way, any expectations on that front? Patti Poppe : Well, we \u2013 you\u2019re right, Ali. We have term limits and Michigan was a good concept in practice, it\u2019s pretty difficult, because we do have a lot of turnover. The good news is, it took a lot to pass the 2016 energy law. It was bipartisan wide support. We have two strong committees in both the House and the Senate. We\u2019re really excited about the leadership appointments in both the House and the Senate. And so, as far as we are hearing from the legislative leadership both from the Governor\u2019s office as well as the Senate and the House, they\u2019ve got other very important issues that need to be attended to, no-fault auto insurance, the road, education in Michigan are really taking top priority for the current legislature and the Governor. And we\u2019re happy to work with them and help make those improvements, but I think the general consensus is the energy law that was passed in 2016 was a great and difficult body of work. And so, it\u2019s really still in the implementation phase of that law and we don\u2019t expect changes to it in the short run. Ali Agha : Got it. Thank you. Patti Poppe : Yep, you\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please, go ahead. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Patti Poppe : Hey, Praful. Rejji Hayes : Hey, Praful. Praful Mehta : Hi. So, maybe first just on this extreme weather events, right, whether it be 2018 summer or now the winter and this polar vortex, just trying to understand, if these kind of events continue, does that fit within the IRP and the load planning that you have, do you think it changes any of the infrastructure needs and does that change potentially the growth profile? So any color on that or thought around that would be helpful? Patti Poppe : Well, so specifically on the electric side, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking about, the IRP, first of all, has the ability to be refiled every three to five years. So, if we start to see a material load difference, then we would plan accordingly. I will say that even yesterday, for example, where MISO had issues in the Midwest. We were plus 1,000 megawatts in Michigan of supply. So, our planned forecast IRP that we published, I think, reflects a very conservative perspective about being able to deal with the kind of peaks that occur on the electric system. And on the gas system, I think traditionally our system is well equipped and capable of serving this volume of load. Our interruption yesterday was driven by an equipment failure at our largest storage field, but normally under any kind of, even these extreme conditions, we would have been well equipped to serve that load. And in fact, yesterday morning, when we hit our peak load, our system works perfectly and we had ample supply and ample ability to deliver that supply and we\u2019ve not had to curtail any residential customers even to this unprecedented weather events with the shortfall of our Ray storage field included. So, very proud of the team and how we\u2019re handling the situation, but the system definitely is robust and prepared for the future. Praful Mehta : Got it. That\u2019s a super helpful color and great performance by infrastructure. So, that\u2019s phenomenal. Maybe moving on, more on the financial side, the pension funding aspect in \u2013 you had $240 million in 2018, could you remind us is there any plan to have any incremental funding in 2019 that\u2019s just currently in your plan, or is there any need to fund 2019 or 2020? Rejji Hayes : Yes, there\u2019s currently no obligation based on the funded status to fund the pension in 2019. We basically pulled forward about $100 million of required spend in 2019 through this contribution in December of 2018. So, I think at least for 2019, there is not an expected contribution. 2020, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s one either, but we think that we derisk the plan most importantly, rather significantly by this discretionary contribution in 2018. Praful Mehta : Got you. Thanks, Rejji. And then in terms of parent and other, obviously, there was a big move, just to understand that impact on parent and other, you clarified that this was mostly related with one-time costs of refinancing and taking out older debt with more obviously cost-efficient debt at the parent level. Is that the entire impact or are there other impacts at the parent level that we should be aware of? Rejji Hayes : Well, I think in addition to the proactive refinancings, which have associated make-whole costs. I mean obviously every year because the business is growing and we\u2019re funding capital investments, we will have incremental increases in parent debt, which is basically new money financing that we do each year. And so we did issue some hybrids in like a couple of tranches in 2018. So, you\u2019ll see interest \u2013 incremental interest expense associated with. So that\u2019s another source of drag that you see in the corporate. Praful Mehta : Got you. And that 2019 level that you have, is that the expected level of interest expense at the parent and the EPS at the parent, is that expected to stay flat from there? Or how do you see the parent earnings going forward post 2019? Rejji Hayes : Yes. I mean, well, remember you got a few things in there. And so we\u2019ll expect incremental interest expense given the growth of the business. And so you\u2019ll have that flowing through the parent and clearly that\u2019s non-recoverable. We do have also a little bit of drag that we talked about in our Q4 call of last year and that\u2019s because of the impacts of federal tax reform, where just the net deductions that you get at that level just aren\u2019t worth as much as they were previously, but I think the other impact too is that we have EnerBank flowing through those numbers. And so that will also be impacting the parent and other expense, because EnerBank is a component of that. And as we always have talked about in the past, we do expect that EnerBank will grow in excess of the consolidated business. And see a little \u2013 you see that as a little bit of an offset of those other, I\u2019ll say, sources of drag. Praful Mehta : Got you. Thanks so much guys. Really appreciate it. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Praful. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Praful. Operator : Our next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller : Good morning. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Travis. Travis Miller : I was wondering if you talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes, how you think you achieve that settlement deal when you\u2019ve had some issues trying to do that in the past, what was the key with that settlement? Patti Poppe : Well, I think there are a couple of things that were critical to the settlement. We\u2019re very proud of the fact that we were able to settle that, but I think it\u2019s a reflection of the quality of the regulatory environment. As we have mentioned over the last couple years with Chairman Sally Talberg at the Public Service Commission, she has done an excellent job of building the quality staff, nothing raised the bar for the quality of our filings, the request of a five-year electric distribution plan combined with the visibility that the commission and the staff had on our integrated resource plan. You can imagine their ability to see how our filing fits into those long-term plans is a much better way to do good regulation and make good decisions on behalf of the citizens of Michigan. So I would attribute it to a lot of hard work by our team to have good long-term plans. Our request by the commission to see those plans and have them be public, so that we can have good discussions with critical stakeholders and then a willingness to make good decisions together and have a settlement for the best interest of all customers. So, very happy with that outcome. I think it really sets the ground and the framework for future orders as well as future cases regarding our electric investment strategy and cost savings that we can pass along to customers through those filings. Travis Miller : Okay. Great. And then one other on the whole electric rate case In general. What kind of distribution upgrades either in \u2013 that were approved in the rate case or future would be needed to integrate the level of renewables. Is there anything at the distribution level and perhaps how much and what would be needed in terms of grid upgrades to integrate? Patti Poppe : Yes. Of course, that definitely will have a key eye on the distributed energy resources and how to integrate those into the grid. I would suggest in this filing, It\u2019s more about the basic blocking and tackling of poles and conductors and substations, transformers, making sure that the equipment that is on the system is robust and reliable. Our five-year electric distribution plan is a $3 billion investment strategy that has more of the high technology attributes at the latter half of the five-year plan. So, including better visibility through SCADA systems on the distribution system, our ability to have control remotely, our ability to see the operations of the grid to do more looping and smart switching on the system, all of those investments are throughout the five-year plan, but more back-end-weighted. So, this specific settlement really is focused on the backbone and the basics of the electric distribution system. I often say you can\u2019t put fancy whizbang technology on poles that are falling over. So, make sure we\u2019ve got the poles secure. We\u2019ve got the right conductor, transformer, substations and then we\u2019ll bolt on the technology to the best service of customers throughout the distribution plan. Travis Miller : Okay. Great. Look forward to the whizbang technology. Patti Poppe : We do too. I know it\u2019s going to make operating drill a lot easier, but first thing is first. Thanks, Travis. Travis Miller : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Fishman : Hi. Good morning. Congrats on another solid year. Patti Poppe : Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. David Fishman : Thanks. Just following up on the regulatory items that we\u2019re talking about, it seems like when I was reading a little bit of staff testimony, it was actually pretty favorable with regarding earnings sharing mechanism. I know this is meant to coincide with a tracker. But I was just curious if this is something in a future filing, you might pursue separate from a tracker. Patti Poppe : I think what we believe about this current electric rate case settlement is that this deferred accounting that we agreed to really is a first step in the direction of tracker \u2013 of a tracker for future filings. And so that again, comes with as we build trust. We have a tracking mechanism for example on the gas system for our enhanced infrastructure replacement program. And over the last couple years, we\u2019ve done a great job of doing precisely what we said we would do and that gives confidence then to the commission that they can do preapprovals in a more routine formulaic tracking mechanism, but we\u2019re quite satisfied with this outcome of the settlement and we think it foretells well future filings. David Fishman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Andrew Weisel : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just first I want to clarify something; I think Rejji answered in an answer to Ali\u2019s question about demand growth. I think you said you\u2019re expecting flat, maybe up a 0.25%, but in your Slide 16, you showed 1% growth from sales and economic developments. How do I reconcile those, is that purely energy efficiency? Rejji Hayes : Yes. So, long-term over the five years, we expect flat to a 0.25% for growth. So that is first and foremost. I am referring to the five-year period, but this page often, I think, is a source of confusion. When we talk about sales growth and the simple perhaps unique model slide, Slide 19 that you reference, we\u2019re not suggesting that long-term we\u2019re expecting 1% sales growth. What we\u2019re talking about on that page is how much sales growth contributes to the self-funding strategy. And so when you look at the pieces, we say cost reductions two to three points. That means cost reductions fund half of our capital investment or rate base growth to alleviate the burden to customers. And so sales is a component of that equation as is tax planning as is non-utility contribution. And so those are the pieces that allow us to fund about three quarters in aggregate of our rate base growth. So we can keep total rates, customer prices, bills at or below inflation and so it\u2019s a little bit difficult to fall the way it\u2019s positioned on that page. But we\u2019re not implying 1% growth in long term. Andrew Weisel : Got it. Okay. And then just to follow up on the sales side, any updated thinking with marijuana now legal, have you seen any activity around Grillhouse\u2019s increased demand, and if and when this could turn into a meaningful driver or could it add complexity of demand unexpectedly spikes in house or warehouse, without you guys getting sufficient warning? Patti Poppe : Yeah, those are all great questions. And we are working on evaluating what the effect will be from what we\u2019ve seen from other jurisdictions anywhere from 1% to 4% additional load as a result of the legalization of marijuana has been experienced elsewhere. We\u2019re not forecasting that in our plan yet at all. The regulations are still being defined and clarified, and they are slightly different than other states. We are the only state in the Midwest and so there is a potential that it could be a driver here. We\u2019re actually working very proactively to identify who those growers would be. We\u2019ve had inbound contacts from large growing entities that want to come and locate here and \u2013 which is great because if we have advanced notice, then we can plan where best to place that new quickly growing loads. So we definitely haven\u2019t built into anything into our plan. But we are actively working with the growing community to make sure that we are prepared to serve. Andrew Weisel : Great. And then one just last one here in terms of the gas storage. So obviously you\u2019ve asked customers to conserve usage during this cold snap. My question is, how are gas storage levels going into this week\u2019s polar vortex, and in the past, have there been instances where the reservoirs ran dry or close to it, and how did that work mechanically? Patti Poppe : Yes, no, we had ample supply. In fact, our storage fields were perfectly prepared and ready to serve even peak demand that\u2019s early in the season. So certainly we have abundant supply. If a day like this happened in April, that would be a challenge to the system, because our annual cycle is to draw off the field throughout the winter season. However, we had ample supply. The disruption at our Ray storage field was the equipment that is able to then deliver the stored gas to the system. And so that\u2019s where the bottleneck was yesterday and today, but it certainly wasn\u2019t lack of abundance of gas. We have some of the largest naturally occurring storage fields in the nation, in the continent right here in Michigan, and so we have ample supply, it was just a matter of getting it distributed effectively. Andrew Weisel : Great to hear. Stay warm, I see mixed and feels like it is negative 32 in Jackson. So I guess I can\u2019t complain about five degrees in New York. Good luck. Patti Poppe : Yes. We\u2019re definitely setting records in demand. There is no doubt about it. Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey. Good morning, guys. Patti Poppe : Hey, morning, Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza : Apologize if this was covered, it\u2019s unfortunate to harp on a little bit late. Just in your sort of IRP discussions right now that you\u2019re going through. Is there sort of any dialog or any movement around potentially earning on the PPAs? I mean I know obviously your interest would be to own, but is there still an option right now turn on the PPAs? Patti Poppe : Yes. And if you read the staffs filing, they did not have object to the earnings mechanism. They just had a different formula, which yielded a much lower earnings mechanism on top of the PPA, but like all things, that has definitely opened for negotiation. The staff also filed that we would be able to own 50% of the supply. So there\u2019s lots of room, I would suggest. What I appreciate very much is that all of the stakeholders have been working together for the best integrated resource plan for Michigan. This is a long-term plan. It has long-term ramifications. Some of the current methods of people being able to, for example, purpose solar being added to the system at uncompetitive prices not in the best interest of customers, even though we are fully supportive of additional solar being added to the system. So we think that integrated resource plan has created a great framework. Our willingness to offer a market-driven avoided cost calculation through competitive bidding creates the open platform for this earnings mechanism, so that a developer who is leveraging our balance sheet. The cost of that impact on our balance sheet is adequately reflected in their bid is we think a very constructive framework and we like the direction of the conversations that have been happening here with all the critical stakeholders. So I would suggest that we\u2019re making good progress. Shahriar Pourreza : And then just want to confirm this is incremental to your plan, right, so when you think about your planning inceptions on how you guide. This is something that would be incremental? Patti Poppe : You know, we would say, yes, it would be incremental. But don\u2019t forget, we always are working toward that 6% to 8%, right, and so everything we do is in for the purpose of solidifying our consistent, repeatable, reliable performance. And so all of these outcomes add up to a total picture, it is predictable in total and that\u2019s what we know you love about us and that\u2019s what we really work toward every day. Shahriar Pourreza : Noted. And then just one last question, Patti, and then it\u2019s a little bit of message left more of a minor, question is just around not getting the tracker, at least potentially punting it. Did that impact at all as you think about your 10-year plan that we\u2019ll see very shortly. Did that impact the profile of the spend at all? Patti Poppe : No, because, again, we\u2019re pretty happy about the agreement and the settlement, because it does create a framework for our long-term trackers, but we didn\u2019t plan on long-term trackers. We don\u2019t object to coming in annually and describing what our spend plan is, and that in fact allows us to be more adaptive to changing conditions. And we\u2019re pretty satisfied with that arrangement. So we were very happy with the outcome of the settlement and not to say we wouldn\u2019t appreciate more formulaic rate making, but we are all Okay standing up to the scrutiny of an annual filing as well. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. All my questions have been answered. Have a good one. Patti Poppe : Great. Thanks. Thanks, Shahriar. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Patti Poppe for closing remarks. Patti Poppe : Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. And we\u2019re bundled up here in Michigan working to stay warm. We hope you are where you are. We look forward to seeing you on the road. Operator : Thank you. And the conference is now concluded. We thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The CMS Energy 2019 First Quarter Results. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions]. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 PM Eastern Time running through May 2. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sri Maddipati : Thanks, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the Appendix and posted on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Patti. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Sri. Thanks everyone for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. Now, this morning, I will share our first quarter financial and operating results and review our regulatory calendar. Rejji will add more details on our financial results and outlook and as always we will close with Q&A. Despite two large storms, and an unprecedented Polar Vortex, which challenged our electric and gas systems, we were able to deliver solid first quarter earnings of $0.75 per share which are better than our plan. Regardless of changing weather, economy, political or regulatory conditions, we pride ourselves in our adaptability which enables the delivery of consistent financial results on which you come to rely year after year after year. We're pleased to reaffirm our full-year guidance of 6% to 8% EPS growth based on last year's actual results and are biased towards the mid. We're also reaffirming our plans to grow dividends in line with earnings. Our predictability is enabled by our focus and commitment to our triple bottom-line of people, planet, and process, underpinned by financial and operating performance which remains a low risk and sustainable business approach and it continues to deliver for our customers and our investors. Every dollar of our capital plan is invested with the triple bottom-line in mind and we've seen solid support for this thought process over the years but most recently with the settlement of our gas and electric rate cases as well as our integrated resource plan. Our continued focus on needed investments in the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems and our approach for the cleaner generation fleet with the modular build out of renewable energy has been reinforced by these positive regulatory outcomes. The settlement agreement of the integrated resource plan is a great example of how we work with all stakeholders at Michigan. We're excited to report that our clean energy plan reflected in our IRP received a broad coalition of support including the public service commission staff, Attorney General, our Customer Advocacy Groups, and environmental advocates. Considering the complexity of this case, the parties involved, and the long-term planning of our generation systems this was no easy seek which is why I'm so proud of all the work our team has put into creating a breakthrough outcomes for our company, our customers, and our state. The settlement lays the groundwork for our clean and lean energy future and includes the early retirement of our coal unit Karn 1&2 and the scheduled expiration of our Palisades PPA. The agreement also calls for accelerated energy efficiency, demand response program, and a 1,100 megawatt to solar through 2024 of which half will be owned in rate base and the other half will be contracted with a financial compensation mechanism. The settlement also includes competitive bidding for future solar so we can have the lowest cost and cleanest energy to the People of Michigan. Longer-term the plan calls for a total of 6,000 megawatt to solar and looks at battery storage in the next decade. The modular and low-risk approach coupled with the iterative nature of the IRP filing process provides flexibility and will allow us to take advantage of declining cost and potential technology breakthroughs. We expect the commission decision on the settlement by mid-June. Looking at our calendar for the year, you'll see another successful quarter on the regulatory front. This included the approval of 525 megawatts of wind in our renewable energy plan, a final settlement agreement for our IRP, and the Commission order in our electric rate case settlement and where we've agreed to stay out of an electric rate case until 2020. This quarter was just another demonstration of the strength in our regulatory environment in Michigan. While we're on top of recent regulatory developments, we'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate Dan Scripps in his recent appointment to the commission. We really look forward to working with Commissioner Scripps moving forward. Our gas rate case is also moving along. The staff having filed their position earlier this month for an additional $146 million of revenue with support for nearly all of the investments and the O&M we have requested. We'll continue to work with the staff and stakeholders in this case and expect the final order from the commission by September 30th. With the continued support of the MPSC staff, and other stakeholders, our electric rate case settlement allows for increased investment in electric reliability of $200 million. The case was completed in just eight months after filing and marked only the second time in our history where we settled an electric rate case. The settlement also included deferred accounting for emergent work which enables us to better plan and manage our electric distribution related capital investment. One of those reliability projects was a circuit upgrade outside of Grand Rapids. As part of that project, we needed to disconnect a customer for a few hours during the week. It was the home of an elderly couple and the husband had voiced their concerns to one of our co-workers. His wife was sick and he was worried about keeping her comfortable while the power was out. One of our field leaders Jimmy Brady reached out to the customer to understand his concerns better. What Jimmy found was that they just needed somewhere warm to stay during this planned outage. Jimmy purchased gift cards for gas and dinner and took the extra step to put the gift card in a get well card and delivered it to the customer, so he could care for his wife. Now I make calls to customers every week to get direct sense of what they're experiencing with our team. And I heard this story for the first time on one of those calls. Our customer was so touched by Jimmy's kindness as he shared this story with me, he broke down in tears. He was overwhelmed because he had been working so hard to care for his wife and Jimmy's simple act of kindness hit the spot. And by the way, we completed the maintenance work on time too continuing to improve our customer's reliability. We don't have a procedure 42 backed dash fee that told Jimmy how to live our purpose. We just have people serving people that is world-class performance delivering home comfort. Another great example of our purpose at work is our simple but perhaps unique business model. Now this is not new and it has lots of runway. At the core of our business model is our ability to self-fund the majority of our needed no big backed capital investments. These needed capital investments are demonstrated by the settlements of our recent gas and electric cases and the approval of our renewable energy plan with 525 megawatts of new wind, the settlement agreement for IRP which includes 1,100 megawatts of solar in the near-term, and staff support for the capital investments in our pending gas rate case. In fact less than 15% of projects in our $11 billion capital plan are over $200 million and half of those are renewable projects that have already been approved. While we continue to grow rate case, we remain focused on customer affordability. One of our key strength is our ability to manage costs. And while we continue to focus on waste elimination across all of our cost drivers by executing the CE Way, we also see significant cost reduction opportunities as we retire coal and allow high priced PPAs higher over time. Rejji will cover some of that in more detail. Sales enable us to manage customer prices as our economic development efforts allow us to spread our costs over greater volume. In addition to this, our energy efficiency programs help our customers reduce their usage and ultimately lower their bill. We earned $34 million through our energy efficiency incentive in 2018 and we forecast it going to $44 million as we implement our IRP energy waste reduction plans. We're also able to true-up our sales through our forward-looking rate making process. Finally, we've put a tax planning and modest contributions from our non-utility businesses further support our ability to deliver consistent premier growth. In fact despite investing $11 billion of capital into our system over the next five years, we expect customer prices to remain flat after inflation. Our model has proven durable over the last decade and we're confident in continued durability over the next. This simple model and our ability to adapt to changing conditions enables us to continuously deliver regardless of whether the economy or other external factors. Just look at our track. 10 years of 7-plus-percent EPS growth. We provide consistent premium results supported by strong operations. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Patti, and good morning everyone. As Patti highlighted, we're pleased to report our first quarter results for 2019. We're just slightly ahead of plan despite severe weather experienced during the quarter. We delivered net income of $213 million which translates into earnings per share of $0.75 per quarter. Our first quarter earnings per share for 2019 were $0.11 lower Q1 2018 results largely due to heavy ice storms experienced in our electric service territory in February. Like always, we plan conservatively manage the work and continue to be ahead of plan. Despite the storm activity, utility was the key driver of our financial performance in Q1 contributing $0.80 per share largely due to our electric rate case settlement and relatively cold winter in Michigan which benefited our gas volumetric sales [indiscernible]. The Utility strong performance was modestly offset by expected underperformance in enterprises versus Q1 of 2018 with lower capacity sales at DIG contributable to the residual effects of the 2018 MISO planning resource auction, and a planned outage of our Filer City plan, both of which were reflected in our full-year EPS guidance. All-in, we started 2019 right on track and we are confident in our ability to deliver another year of consistent industry-leading financial performance. On Slide 12, you can see the key factors impacting our financial performance relative to 2018 in our waterfall chart. Favorable weather provided $0.08 per share positive variance versus Q1 of 2018 and rate relief net of investments contributed another $0.03. These sources of financial upside more than offset by the substantial storm activity which negatively impacts earnings by $0.10 a share, the aforementioned underperformance in enterprises and the higher effective tax rate. The latter two of which in line with our expectations and as mentioned are already incorporated in our full-year estimates. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2019, and encouraged by the glide path to give our full-year 2019 EPS guidance. As illustrated in the chart, the absence of favorable weather pass-through is largely offset by the numerous cost pull-aheads we executed in the second half of 2018. The remaining nine months also included additional rate relief net of investments in the previously settled gas and electric rate cases and the expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas case. Lastly, we expect to realize cost savings across the organization in line with historical trends, enterprise's EPS contribution weighted toward the second half of the year. Needless to say, we'll continue to manage the business with a focus on executing our capital plan and identifying additional cost savings, mitigate future risk of plan, the benefit for customers and investors. To that end Slide 13 best illustrates our historical track record of managing the work during periods of uncertainty to meet our operational and financial objectives. As noted in the past, the periods of unfavorable weather or other sources of downside we rely on our ability to reflect operating and non-operating levers to meet our financial objectives without compromising customer service. Conversely during strong period, we focus on reinvestment in the business to derisk future years and achieve longer-term benefits for customers and investors. Every year is different but we manage to deliver for all stakeholders year in and year out not excuses based on our ability to adapt to changing circumstances in any given year by self-funding the vast majority of our rate-based growth over the long-term to minimize the cost bill impact as Patti discussed earlier. To elaborate on the core elements of our business model, we have an extensive inventory of capital investment projects in utility into our large and aging electric gas systems as noted on Slide 14. As we highlighted on our Q4 call in January and our five-year capital investment program is approximately $11 billion and is largely comprised of gas and electric infrastructure upgrades and investments in multiple generation. The latter of which was supported by the Commission's recent approval by 525 megawatts of one generation investment to meet the 15% renewable portfolio standard emission. Our robust capital plan will further improve the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems and benefit customers of all of our generation portfolio to benefit of the plan and extend the runway for EPS growth benefit of investors. It is also worth noting that our capital investment needs remain significant beyond five-year period as well. As we work through regulatory proceedings most notably the IRP, and our financial planning cycle, we expect that longer-term capital mix will continue to evolve and we look forward to providing you an update to our 10-year capital plan in the second half of the year. As discussed in the past, we invest in our electric and gas systems at a measured pace given customer affordability constraints in order to execute on capital investments of this magnitude, while maintaining affordable bills, our funding strategy is heavily reliant on the identification of cost reduction opportunities and we are confident that we can continue to deliver in this regard. Historically we have emphasized our substantial focus on reducing operating and maintenance expenses. And we have been successful there in the past to coal plant retirements, capital enabled savings like our smart meter installations, and attrition management to name a few. We'll continue to realize cost savings and O&M through those historical measures as well as waste eliminations required by the CE Way amongst other initiatives. However we do not discriminate when it comes to cost savings and we view every component of our cost structure as an opportunity. As we look ahead, there were highly visible cost reduction opportunities in our power supply cost through the expiration of the Palisades and MCB power purchase agreements both priced on average around $55 to $60 per megawatt hour for roughly two times the market cost of power and license which collectively should deliver approximately $150 million of savings per year over time. In the interim, we will continue to realize benefits modernizing our gas and electric distribution systems through reduced service respiration, gas leak repair costs among other opportunities. These opportunities coupled with our perpetual search for non-operating cost savings offer sustainable funding strategy for our capital plan which will keep customer bills low on an absolute basis and relative to other household staples in Michigan as depicted in the chart. From our perspective paying roughly $5 a day combined for safe and reliable electric and gas delivery in the residential home is an extraordinary value proposition. The importance this service to today's standard of living and the substantial costs required to own and operate these things. In addition to our emphasis on strong cost controls, our self-funding strategy also benefits economic development. Slide 16 highlights our success to attract new industrial activity in our service territory over the past two years which has supplemented modest organic growth in our residential and commercial segments. 2018 we expected over 100 megawatts new load which is up from 69 megawatts in 2017. And we're targeting another 100 megawatts in 2019 and are right on track with over 25 megawatts in Q1. Our load growth from these efforts will collectively offer roughly 5,500 jobs, $2 billion of investment in Michigan, and included companies ranging Internet-based retailers, food manufacturers among other industries. This level of secular diversity in our new load is indicative of our electric service territory which represents about two-thirds of our revenue is often misperceived as highly cyclical. In fact in 2018 approximately 2% of our customer contributions came from the Auto as noted in the pie chart on the right hand side of the page. Our proactive efforts on the economic development and a strong track record of realizing cost savings to fund our growth not only enable us to perpetuate our successful long run but also derisk our financial plan in the short-term and the overachievement in the year. And overachievement has become a habit which is a nice segway to our 2019 financing plan. On Slide 17, you'll see that our financing plans with larger derisk for 2019 via opportunistic transactions in 2018 and year-to-date. In the first quarter, we completed just under $1 billion of debt financing to parent including a $630 million six-year hybrid issuance which garners up to 50% equity credit in S&P at an attractive rate 5.875% pre-tax. We've also completed roughly $250 million toward equity issuance through our ATM program over the past 12 months which eliminates pricing risk for planned equity issuance needs through 2020. As we evaluate potential sources of volatility through the remainder of the year, the accelerated execution of the majority of our financing plan, the early settlement of our electric rate case, and the aforementioned 2018 pull ahead, that reduce the probability of large variances in our plan. There will always be sources of volatility in this business be the weather, low cost, regulatory outfits, or otherwise. In every year we view it as our mandate to do the worrying for you and mitigate the risk component. And with that, turn it back to Patti for some closing remarks before Q&A. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Rejji. With our unique self-funding model, enhanced by the CE Way, a large and aging system in need of capital investments, a constructive regulatory framework, and a healthy balance sheet to fund our plan cost effectively, we believe our financial performance is sustainable over the long-term. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you very much, Patti. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. And today's first question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : So I mean I think it goes without saying because you've been very clear but you had a very rare modest miss versus Street consensus in the quarter because you had such a extraordinary storm activity. But given your historic ability to manage the business, you don't have any concerns about being able to bring in the earnings expectation as you articulated for the year just because the first quarter was challenging correct? Patti Poppe : That's correct, Greg. We always adapt, and as we mentioned, we're ahead of our own plan, and so we're very confident in our ability to continue to deliver as always. Greg Gordon : Thanks. And then I'm sure there'll be a lot of questions on the regulatory activity. So I'll leave that for other people. I had a sort of an esoteric question on the DTE call yesterday, you talked about why they don't have and I don't think you guys have either a large amount of lithium ion battery storage built into your expectations for future infrastructure needs and they pointed to the fact that because you guys have the Ludington storage facility and it's such a large and unique asset that it really creates the balancing capacity you need so that battery storage may not other than in very unique circumstances necessarily be a big part of Michigan's future needs. Is that a fair assessment or not? Patti Poppe : Well first of all, yes, Ludington is storage and it's 2,200 megawatts of storage. So yes we love that. In fact, as you've been there, Greg, I know you visited the site. We have six of the world's largest motors at that location six 500,000 horsepower motors. It is a sight to be seen. So anyone who hasn't been there, open invitation. But yes, so obviously we have a lot of experience actually pricing in storage on a daily basis. What we're waiting for and I think we do see more storage and in fact in our IRP, we have storage towards the latter half of the plan. What we're waiting for is the price curve. And I'm very confident that price curve will materialize. And with all the research that's underway with lithium ion for vehicles today, but maybe there will be a breakthrough in solid state. I look forward to that. I think storage is going to be important on the grid to balance voltage and do voltage control for our solar installations that are going to be distributed across the state. So we are hopeful for storage and a technological breakthrough in that but we don't need it to execute our IRP plan until the last part of the 20-year plan. Rejji Hayes : Greg, the only point I would add is in addition to Ludington, as you likely know, we also have peaking capacity in the form of our Karn 3&4 facilities which is over a gigawatt. So that also supports us as we flush out the renewable plant. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning guys. Yes, just had a question on enterprises and that segment came in at nothing for the first quarter and you said it's going to be more weighted to the second half. Is that really going to be mostly a Q3 segment now with the shift to more of an energy contract, so is it more sort of linear through the second half. Can you just give us a bit more sense on the timing there? Rejji Hayes : Yes, I would say it's certainly more backend weighted and I would say it's more weighted towards Q3 and Q4, you'll get a little bit of pickup in Q2 but mostly Q3 and Q4. And the reason why that is, Jonathan, is we had lower capacity sales and that had to do with the fact that we had to basically sell about 400 megawatts of capacity at dig in the planning reserve auction in MISO in mid-2018. And as you know the planning year runs from basically May of the prior year to June of the subsequent year and so we've got about two quarters of exposure in 2019 of those lower capacity sales. And the reason why, as you may recall, we had to subject ourselves MISO planning reserve auction is that we held 400 megawatts of capacity in escrow effectively at gas part of the potential Palisades early termination in 2017. And so we'll wear that for a couple of quarters. It's in our plan and so we would expect that that would recover over time, we've already sold through capacity through 2020. And so we feel pick up some in Q2 but most of it in Q3 and Q4. Jonathan Arnold : And so by extension then Q1 of next year should prove to be more positive than Q1 of this year? Rejji Hayes : Yes, you would think because again we've sold capacity through 2020 around $2 to $3 per kilowatt month. And so we would expect to get a more favorable comp in Q1 of 2020 certainly versus Q1 of 2019. Jonathan Arnold : Okay, great. And then just one other sort of item you talked about expecting energy efficiency earnings to increase from $34 million to $44 million or so and as you implement the IRP. What's the timing on getting to that higher level, is it -- it's not for a year or two or was it sooner than that? Patti Poppe : Yes, Jonathan, great question. We're going to phase it and we're going from 1.5% in our electric business energy efficiency to 2% and it's when we get to that 2% that it takes it to $44 million and that'll be mid-2020. Jonathan Arnold : Mid-2020, okay great. That's it, thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hey question on the financial compensation mechanism. So I realize that I guess there's a continuing talks about this, but at 5.88% that's above short-term debt but the long probably below the overall cost of capital, weighted cost capital for the company. I'm just wondering if this is -- this 5.88% that was settled this is like kind of an opening bid like if things go well later on people might be more amenable to raising that number as long as the markets seem okay with it, the solar markets seem okay with it. Rejji Hayes : Michael, it's good question. So just to be clear the 5.88% that does reflect our WACC or weighted average cost of capital and that was what was agreed to in the settlement. And so we think that's the appropriate level for an FCM particularly given the fact that we'll be able to own and rate base effectively half of the solar investment opportunity over the next few years. And so the 1,100 megawatts that we agreed to effectively through 2024 will get 550 megawatts of that. And then, as you know, the filing and the IRP itself is an iterative process per the statute. And so we've agreed put a settlement to file again in June of 2021, so we'll see what the fact pattern is at that point. Obviously cost of capital moves all the time and so it makes sense to adjust it at that point and suggest something else we'll look to do that at that point. Patti Poppe : To be clear, we're really excited about that FCM it gives us optionality in the best way to have the lowest cost energy, delivery, and supply. We're very happy with the outcome of the IRP. We think it really reflects our values and we think it reflects our business model and it just allows our business model of ample CapEx backed up by our ability to do it at the lowest cost to protect customers from affordability constraints. It really fits right into our plan. Michael Weinstein : Right. Could you I mean could you characterize kind of what the discussions are surrounding at this point over the next month or two? What are the solar advocates want out of this process at this point? Patti Poppe : Well to be clear there's a range of solar advocates. We had the Sierra Club, the NRDC sign on to our settlement and certainly their solar advocates. I guess I would consider as solar advocates. We all agree that solar has an important role to play here in Michigan matches our load profile extremely well and combined with things like Ludington and Karn, as Rejji mentioned, we've got a really nice mix of supply. So the conversation has been how to do that at the lowest cost possible. And we feel very excited about the competitive bidding process for the supply resources. We think that's an important stand to take on behalf of the people of Michigan that we want to make sure we have the lowest cost resources on the system and have optionality around the CapEx surrounds that, so that we can invest the next best dollar where it needs to be invested in the entire system. I would say some of the large out-of-state kind of profit maximizing solar developers don't love the outcome because they're going to have to compete on price and not lean on PREPA. And that PREPA loophole doesn't work. And it saddles the Michigan customers with unnecessary high priced solar. And so I would suggest that our commitment to competitive bidding really change the nature of the discussion here in Michigan that we're going to stand for the lowest cost and cleanest energy resources for the people that we serve. Operator : And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So perhaps just to reconcile this, I mean just at a high-level, the IRP obviously you've got just about over a gig of potential opportunity here split between rate base and PPA. How does that reconcile with your current CapEx budget at the end of the day? And then maybe a second but related question is how do you think about updating the needs for generation over time here. What would that timeline look like and how could that reconcile against what you all have here in the IRP today? And I know that's somewhat of a transient question, right. It'll change over time. Rejji Hayes : Yes. So, Julien, good question. I would say as it pertains to the five year plan, we don't see a great deal of, I will say, capital investment impact in our five year plan. So, as you know, we're at about just over a $11 billion most of which is wires and pipes capital investment, we've got $1 billion of renewables in our plan but that's largely attributable to wind build out basically to get to the 15% RPS. And so a lot of the capital investment opportunity that's coming out of this settlement agreement is really beyond this five-year plan. So you'll see some of it. We'll take ownership of some of it kind of in the 2022, 2023 period but not a great deal. It's also worth noting that you're going to have Karn 1&2 in the outer years of our plan come out, if we succeed in retiring that plant in 2023 as promised. And so when you think about the puts and takes, you'll see probably a net neutral impact, I'd say in the next five to six years now. The bigger opportunity going forward is, as you look, at the incremental five gigawatts that will build out over the next decade plus I think in year's six to 10 of a potential 10 year plan, you'll see more significant capital investments on the solar side. And so there could be upside there and again we've talked about in the back half of this year offering a new 10-year plan which likely reflects some of that. And then if you think about the capacity build out, I'll say a couple of decades from now in our capacity plan, we're going to be losing over time about four gigawatts of capacity. So you're going to see two gigawatts come out in the form of the MCV and Palisades PPAs and then another two gigawatts come off over the next 20 years retire -- as we retire the coal fleet and so substantial capital investment opportunity on the solar side over time. And we think that offers potentially around $3 billion of capital investment opportunities to think about the spend on the capital side through 2030. So quite a bit of opportunity but early days of course. Patti Poppe : I would also offer that the capital opportunities on our entire system are not -- we don't require all of our investment to go into supply. It's not; I would say the investment mix of the past. The opportunity to have distributed resources is going to require a significant amount of grid investment as well to make sure that we can integrate those distributed resources into the grid and make sure that our reliability is high. So the mix between distribution and supply is going to shift to distribution as well as in our gas system. And so when I talk about looking for the next best place to put a capital dollar, everyone can remember and always remember that this is not a question of building up rate base. This is a question of how best to affordably deliver the capital that delivers the customer value and customer service, the reliability; all of those things are driven by how much capital is required in the system. So the system needs are driving the CapEx. We're not trying to backfill CapEx and searching for CapEx and using supply as a means of doing that. We're trying to figure out the best way to deliver the services for customers with all the CapEx that needs to be done and to be able to do that affordably. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, excellent. And just to clarify this, I know you have got billion-ish in the plan today for renewables. When you talk down the materiality of 2022, 2023 solar, it's more because it's something of a rounding within the wider plan contemplated? Rejji Hayes : Yes, that's -- that's right. So you basically in the outer years of plan, you'll start to take ownership of some of that 550 megawatts. But again as we always talk about the constraint on our capital is really affordability and so we think based on the five-year plan, we rolled on our Q4 call that little over $11 billion of aggregate capital investment is what our customers can comfortably afford as well as our balance sheet I might add. And so the composition of that capital investment program may change a touch as we look at the outer years of the plan. But I would say for now it's primarily wires and pipes. Again you may get additional solar but we think $11 billion is right at this point in time. Operator : And today's next question comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Wanted to go back to everyone's favorite topic, the financial compensation mechanism really interesting and really innovative approach. I guess the mechanics that ultimately got used here is a bit different than what you had proposed but it strikes me that the result is broadly in line with the approach that you had initially proposed, is that a fair characterization? Patti Poppe : That's a fair characterization. At the end of the day, we wanted to first of all be toward agnostic around who builds and who owns these assets. We wanted to make sure that we had the proper alignment that we have the lowest cost supply resources on the system. And so conceptually, what we're talking about is making sure that the reflection on our balance sheet of our being this high quality off-taker for any kind of contract there's no way a developer gets that contract or the financing approved without us being the off-taker that that's reflected and there's an impact on our balance sheet at least the way S&P calculates. And so conceptually that's what the FCM is intended to represent. And so we're very happy with this outcome. We think it's a new standard and it really gives us a position to advocate for customers fully. Stephen Byrd : That makes sense. And then my next question is really longer-term when you think about renewables in your discussion with the variety of parties in the state, this concept of basically splitting ownership versus PPA a 50/50 split beyond the 1,100 megawatts in there kind of near to medium-term. Is that an approach you think that has buy in, in the longer run within the state? Patti Poppe : Well it is and it worked for the 2008 Energy Law as we filed subsequent IRPs. We could revisit it. We actually didn't go in asking for the opportunity that our original filing did not include an opportunity for us to be guaranteed, the right to own. But through the discussions and that's what's healthy about a settlement process you can have really in-depth discussions with the parties to come to a conclusion that everyone really can live with. And so the settlement process has served, I think the people of Michigan very well in this scenario and certainly you, our investors, are equally well served through the outcome of this IRP. Operator : And our next question today comes from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta : Hi, so maybe just firstly on the quarter on the storm cost, this is something we've seen across the space where companies have utilities have had challenges with storm costs. What is the threshold we should be thinking about as it relates to CMS in terms of what size storms are recoverable, what size storms are not. And how does this, how do you see this going forward as an impact to your earnings? Rejji Hayes : Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Praful. So recoverable, I will go about that in a couple of ways. So there's recoverable in the form of what's in rates and then there's recoverable in the form of we do have transmission and distribution insurance which also offers a little bit of risk mitigation. And so in terms of what's in rates, the amount of storms that we realized over the course of Q1 is already in excess of what's currently incorporated in rates. And so we do plan conservatively and so in our budget we did assume that there would be service restoration needs in excess of what's in rates. And then as you think about the insurance programs we have in place then it's a function of the deductibles you have and whether a particular storm exceeds that deductibles. And that's what allows you to get recovery and so as you may recall, when had the significant storm activity in March of 2017, we actually got quite a bit of claims back our way because of the level deductible at that point. And admittedly deductibles have gone up a bit. And so I would say that you need a pretty substantial storm activity to get insurance recovery but we did get some recovery of the storms we saw in early February in the Grand Rapids area. Is that helpful? Praful Mehta : Yes, that's super helpful color. Appreciate that. And maybe for the second question, you guys talked about the runway of the plan where the cost management clearly is something that you guys have executed successfully and one important part of that is PPAs ruling off. I guess as these PPAs do roll off, do you see limited scope going beyond that or do you see this horizon of the ability to kind of manage costs and keep rates low while you build out on CapEx even beyond that PPA roll off? Patti Poppe : Praful, the cost savings as far as I can see and it's certainly the PPAs, I like to call those are well -- I call them our cash for clunkers because those PPAs are out of market. They're high priced and when we replace those with fuel free energy, it really is an amazing combination to grow earnings while we're reducing costs for customers. So certainly we've got in the five-year plan ample cost savings but beyond that our abilities that we are creating to our consumers energy way to see and eliminate waste on demand are still in their early stages. I'm just watching the team really develop the skills to see and eliminate waste that reduces the human struggle for our co-workers as they're attempting to serve customers and at the same time reduces costs and improves the customer experience. And so rest assured there is our simple, unique business model has lots of runway. This model lives; we've got ample CapEx, lots of costs yet to be reduced. And then that just protects our customers from affordability constraints and enables positive regulatory outcomes and improves service to customers every single day. So rest easy the model live. Praful Mehta : Great story guys. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Patti Poppe : Thanks Praful. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Andrew Weisel : Hey good morning everyone. Just another question on the SCM, the WACC I believe is as you previously discussed a little bit. It's relatively low as 5.88% but I believe that's because of the deferred taxes in your capital structure right. So can you remind us what percent of the cap structure is deferred taxes and over how many years you expect to work that down to zero? Rejji Hayes : Yes. So you're right, Andrew, and so the 5.88% WACC that we agreed to as part of the financial compensation mechanism that is on an after-tax basis, it does take into account what I'll call about 20% or just under that of deferred federal income taxes that are a component of a rate making capital structure. I can't tell you exactly when that will amortize down to zero. But I can say directionally if you think about the glide path for refunding customers effectively, the deferred income taxes that we collected over the last several years as part of normalization and then also as part of the settlement for unprotected assets and liabilities at some point will be returned to customers. I would say you'd have a gradual somewhere between $35 million to $45 million reduction in that deferred federal income tax component of a rate making capital structure over the next several years. So probably 35 to 45 years depending on the asset class, electric amortizes a little faster because it has a shorter useful life than the gas assets. And so my sense is about 35 to 45 years that ticks down. Andrew Weisel : I certainly hope to not following your stock when that happens. Rejji Hayes : As you like. Andrew Weisel : You previously said you don't expect the cash taxpayer payer until 2023. Is that still the case given the solar plants? Rejji Hayes : That's right. And I would just qualify it a little bit. We expect it to be about a partial cash taxpayer at that point and more closely to a fully -- a full cash taxpayer by about 2024. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great. Then lastly, what do you think about, I know the plan for the next three years is just solar and beyond that you talked about solar and batteries. What would it take for your wind to become a part of that plan going forward? Patti Poppe : Well we do have 525 megawatts of additional wind that we're going to be adding to achieve our renewable portfolio standard in the near-term so that's underway. What we see about wind is it's getting harder and harder to site. And so as we did the analysis for the long-term, distributed solar really matches the load curve here in Michigan combined with we do have 1,200 megawatts of base load gas plus the Ludington pump storage. We have our base load power really available. And so solar because it's distributed, because it's modular, because we can build it fast, and because that cost curve is occurring so fast that we really do see that combined with the current one we have the 525 additional megawatts of wind is the right mix. Operator : And our next question today comes from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Fishman : Just following on I think with Stephen's IRP question, is there an expectation or goal that when you re-file in 2021 or at some other point for the larger six to 10-year option you said that CMS can show effectively that utility owned renewables is more economic than some of the third-parties prices that you expect to see or you haven't seen as a result may be easier in the future to get a guarantee higher than 50% for owning? Patti Poppe : I think I would say that because of the way the law was written and then we do these ongoing filings, it does mean the plan is adaptable and can change over time. If we do demonstrate that we're the most cost effective then I think that will be compelling. What I would suggest is that being able to build 50% is a really great position to be in and being able to then deploy our capital elsewhere in other parts of our system that are in high demand really works for our model because again I can't overemphasize the amount of capital that the system demands relative to customers ability to pay and the balance sheet to be able to afford, it's a constant internal battle for where the next best capital dollar is. And so having some optionality on the supply side actually really works for us especially with the SCM. It really is a great mix for us in our opinion and as we do future filings of course the plan can adapt and change as conditions change and that's really the secret, one of the secrets I would say at CMS. There's no big bet strategy. Modular, adaptable, changing conditions, whether it's weather or politics or the economy this is what's special about us. We adapt to those changing conditions because we can because we don't have big bets. As I mentioned only 15% of our $11 billion CapEx plan are projects over $200 million and half of those are preapproved renewable projects. So the fact that our plan has so much flexibility in it going forward is part of our strength and part of the secret that we can continue to deliver year after year after year that premium growth six to eight reliably. David Fishman : Okay. Thank you for the very thorough explanation. So that makes sense helps to provide you a good bit of balance and flexibility. One small follow-up just more a housekeeping item. I think there was a small outage for TS Filer because it's no longer going to be repowered. I was just wondering does that spill over at all into the second quarter. Rejji Hayes : There may be a touch of it spills in the second quarter but I wouldn't say it's a material amount. And it's also important to note that Filer yes, it's a contributor to enterprises performance but it's not a significant contributor, dig really dictates the vast majority of the financial performance of enterprises. David Fishman : Right. Okay. I think as I said before the dig, you all have one more quarter of material headwind that should kind of go back to being the bilateral market second half? Rejji Hayes : That's right. Given just the timing of the planning year versus the calendar year. Operator : And our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Hello Shahriar your line is open, perhaps you're muted. Constantine Lednev : Oh sorry about that. It\u2019s actually Constantine for Shahriar here. Yes, I was on mute. A lot of great disclosure and a lot of the questions have been answered. One kind of high-level on the IRP and the 6,000 kind of megawatts of long-term solar. Are you thinking about kind of a timing or a shape to how I guess the point I know you talked about the 1,100 megawatts are being a little bit more tailwind in the five-year plan. But beyond that kind of how linear is deployment? Patti Poppe : Yes, it's ahead of the retirements because obviously we don't want to wait for the retirement date and then start to build the solar, so we front feet, I would say the plan and then it spreads across the time horizon up to the point that our last coal unit Campbell 3 retires. And so it really is a relatively smooth across the 20-year time horizon. But just again as conditions change, load materializes more or less that's the strength of this plan that it's modular and we can adapt. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Patti Poppe for any closing remarks. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Rocco, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning and we certainly look forward to seeing you all out on the road. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for their participation. Have a great day.",

This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Sri Maddipati : Thank you, Rocco. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix, and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Patti. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Sri. And thank you everyone for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. This morning I'll share our first half financial results and outlook, and I'll also review our approved IRP settlement that lays the groundwork for our clean energy future. Rejji will add more details on our financial results and review the model. And as always, we'll close with Q&A. The first half of this year was challenging, but manageable given our unique capabilities and our conservative planning. Despite unfavorable weather and significant storm activity, we remain on track through the first half of the year with earnings of $1.08 per share. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $2.47 to $2.51 per share with a bias to the midpoint, and we'll continue to manage the work as we adapt to changing conditions through the remainder of the year to achieve the results you expect. While every year is different, the blueprint to the CMS model is simple and repeatable. We plan conservatively to deliver the consistent results that you can count on year in and year out. Our actions to reinvest positive weather in 2018, benefited customers last year and have positioned us well to meet our financial objectives this year, which Rejji will describe in more detail. This model, where we ride the roller coaster, so you can enjoy a smooth and predictable outcome, has served us well over the last decade plus. And we'll continue to utilize it going forward to achieve our 6% to 8% growth. The major highlight for the second quarter was the MPSC's approval of our Integrated Resource Plan settlement. As clean energy leaders, we take pride in our long-term IRP, that is the map for our clean and lean energy future. We had broad support for our plan including, the Attorney General, the MPSC staff, residential and business customer groups, and environmental advocates. In the near term, the settlement includes the planned expiration of the Palisades PPA in 2022, and the early retirement of two of our remaining five coal units Karn 1 and 2 in 2023. We'll meet our near-term needs with increased demand side resources, which have economic incentives, as well as 1,100 megawatts of solar, which will be procured through competitive RFPs conducted over the next three years for projects delivered in 2022 through 2024. Half of the projects will be owned and included in rate base, and the other half will be contracted through PPAs on which we will earn our new financial incentive mechanism. A good portion of this including our demand response programs are not yet baked into our financial plans, and we consider it all as upside for our customers, our planet and our investors. Longer term, the IRP calls for a total of 6,000 megawatts of solar to replace the expiration of the MCV contract and the retirement of our remaining three coal plants. There was once a time when we had to make a sucker's choice, between clean and expensive energy, or the cheap and dirty stuff, that just isn't true anymore. And our plan along with the broad support we have gained for it demonstrates that. There is not a trade-off here, only a trade up- affordable bills, a cleaner environment, and a higher quality mix of earnings. Our Michigan legislators understood this important balance when they passed the 2016 Energy Law, which included an increase in our renewable portfolio standard, and incentives for demand side resources and PPAs. As we look to the future, we'll also begin incorporating more storage as costs continue to decline. Let me remind you that storage is not new to us, as we have been dispatching it for some time at the Ludington Pumped Storage facility and understand the value that it provides to our customers, which is why my story of the month really is a story of the last half-century. 1969 was the year we began construction with our partners at DTE at the Ludington Pumped Storage facility. Those of you who heard the music while waiting for our call might have noticed it was all from 1969. No detail left unattended at CMS. There on that bluff overlooking Lake Michigan, we built what was at the time, the world's largest battery that has served our customers for over 50 years. We recently renewed its license with FERC for another 50. While initially built to utilize excess power produced by nuclear power plants at night, now Ludington is a key asset in our portfolio as we integrate more renewables. We began an upgrade of the facility in 2011, which will be completed next year. This upgrade creates about 420 megawatts of additional capacity, making Ludington Pumped Storage the fourth largest pumped storage facility in the world. In fact, we have the six largest motors in the world, each at 500,000 horsepower of clean energy production. Now that's the muscle car after my own heart. The upgrade will improve the efficiency of the facility, while also reducing the time it takes to refill the pond. In other words recharge the battery by five hours. For our estimates, Ludington offers an annual value to our customers of about $60 million through the energy and capacity it provides. For over 50 years, we've integrated storage in our daily generation strategy including pricing it into the day ahead in real-time MISO markets. As a result, we've had plenty of time to familiarize ourselves with how batteries work on our system. In fact, we consider ourselves storage experts. We look forward to technology advancements that allow us to take advantage of additional low cost battery storage in the future. Switching gears to regulatory matters. Governor Whitmer made another appointment to the commission, and I would like to take a moment to congratulate Commissioner Tremaine Phillips on his appointment and thank Commissioner Saari, who has served this state well, in many capacities. Commissioner Philips is a Democrat, and formerly served as Director of the Cincinnati 2030 district, a project focused on sustainable energies. He also worked in Governor Granholm's Administration on Michigan related energy policy. Over the next few years, we look forward to working with Commissioner Phillips, Commissioner Scripps, who was another great recent addition to the commission, and Chairman Talberg, who will retain her role as chair at this time. It's worth reminding you that our model allows us to perform consistently regardless of changes at the commission, unfavorable weather conditions, the economy, or other external factors. Our track record demonstrates our ability to deliver consistent premium results year, after year, after year, and this year, you can expect the same. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Patti, and good morning everyone. For the second quarter, we reported net income of $93 million, which translates into $0.33 of earnings per share. Our second quarter results were $0.15 below our Q2 2018 results, largely due to mild weather, which impacted our electric volumetric sales. On a year-to-date basis, we have delivered $306 million net income or $1.08 per share, the latter which is $0.26 per share lower than our financial results in the first half of 2018. Weather continue to be the key driver of financial performance in 2019, starting with the substantial storm activity experienced in our electric service territory in Q1, which led $0.09 in negative variance versus the first half of 2018. In the second quarter, we saw cooling degree days approximately 30% below normal, which also contributed the negative variance in the electric business, and is offset in the positive gas sales we've seen over the course of 2019. Weather aside, the balance negative variance versus 2018 was largely driven by anticipated underperformance enterprise in the first half of the year, and a higher effective tax rate, both of which were incorporated into our EPS guidance for the year. These headwinds were partially offset by rate relief, net investment-related costs, which provide $0.07 positive variance relative to the first half of 2018. That said, we remain on track to achieve our full year EPS guidance, as Patti noted, given the back-end loaded nature of our 2019 plan which we highlighted earlier this year, and a steady implementation of cost control measures over the course of this year, which has kept us on the plan. As always, we plan conservatively and manage the work to meet our operational and financial objectives year in and year out, and 2019 will be no different. To elaborate on the glide path for the second half of the year on the right hand side of the waterfall chart on Slide 12, you can see the key components of our year-to-go financial plan, which gives us a high degree of confidence that we'll achieve our 2019 financial objectives. As always, we plan for normal weather, and you can see the benefits of last year's cost pull aheads which provided 20% of expected positive variance versus the second half of 2018 more than offset the absence of favorable weather in 2018. To put the magnitude of last year's pull aheads in context, in 2017 we had operating and maintenance expenses of approximately $970 million and spent just under $1.1 billion in 2018 funded by last year's weather driven financial upside, which is why we're confident the 2019's O&M spend will be well below the 2018 levels. The remaining six months of the year also include about $0.12 of additional rate relief, net investment related cost driven by the previously set electric rate case and the expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas case for which we're scheduled to get a commission order by the end of September. Lastly, we expect the balance of our year to go plan to be comprised largely of cost savings, and non-weather sales performance at the utility, and enterprise earnings contribution, all of which are forecast and enumerated in the table on the lower right hand side in the page. Now I'll touch on these more in detail. Starting with utility as discussed in the past, every year we plan for 2% to 3% net cost savings which are reflected in our estimates of $0.06 to $0.09 of positive variance. And so the top line, we anticipate weather normalized sales to be flat for the year versus 2018, which reflects the usual conservatism, and we have been encouraged by the favorable mix that we have seen over the past several months, as our higher margin residential and commercial customer segments have exceeded expectations. So we're forecasting about $0.06 to $0.08 of EPS pickup there. As for enterprises for our initial guidance, enterprise earnings are expected to be back-end weighted, as lower capacity sales are being attributable to the residual effects of the 2018 MISO planning resource auction roll-off. So we'll begin to see the positive variance versus 2018 in the second half of the year as our fully contracted 2019-2020 plan year capacity contracts commence. Closing out the 2019 war, the weather has largely been a headwind of the electric business in the first 6 months of the year. We have been encouraged by the volumetric sales trends we have seen in July with cooling degree days approximately 10% above normal on electric service territory to date. We've estimated about $0.04 potential upside to our plan attributable to the July weather, but needless to say we never plan for weather to drive our financial performance. So we'll continue to manage the business with a healthy level of paranoia the benefit of customers and investors. As a reminder for how we have managed to perpetuate our success over the years, our focus on cost controls, conservative financial planning, and proactive risk management underpin our simple but unique business model depicted on Slide 13, which enables us to deliver consistent industry-leading financial performance, year in and year out. We have a robust backlog of capital investments, which improves the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems for our customers, and drives earnings growth for our investors. We fund this growth largely through cost cutting, tax planning, economic development, and modest non-utility contribution, all efforts which we deem sustainable in the long-run. As such, we are confident that we can continue to improve customer experience through capital investments while meeting our affordability and environmental targets for many years to come. Digging into the core elements of our business model was announced earlier in the year. We have a capital investment plan of over $11 billion over the next 5 years, which focuses on the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems, as well added renewable generation as depicted on slide 14. Our capital investment needs remain significant beyond the five-year period. With our IRP in the execution phase, a gas rate order pending and the initial stages of our financial planning cycle underway, we look forward to providing an update to our 10-year capital plan in the fourth quarter. As we plan for the future, the key constraints for our long-term capital investment plan will be customer affordability, and balance sheet and workforce capacity. As for the quarter, we remain acutely focused on cost reduction opportunities throughout our cost structure, which offers over $5 billion of opportunities, excluding depreciation and amortization expense. Over the next decade, the exploration of the high-priced Palisades and MCV power purchase agreements should collectively deliver approximately $150 million of annual savings over time. Also the gradual retirement of our coal fleet will provide substantial O&M and fuel savings beginning with the retirement of our Karn 1 and 2 units in 2023, which we estimate will generate approximately $30 million of O&M savings. And while we remain coal plant operators, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce our structural costs as evidenced by the recent renegotiation of the fuel transportation costs at our Campbell units which has led to an estimated $150 million of nominal savings over the next several years. These opportunities on the supply side of the business will be supplemented with capital enabled savings, as we modernize our electric and gas distributions, which should reduce our operations and maintenance expenses. Lastly, the CUA will serve as the key pillar of our cost reduction strategy over time as we eliminate waste throughout the organization. These efforts will provide a sustainable funding strategy for our capital plan which will keep customer bills low on an absolute basis and relative to other household staples in Michigan as depicted in the chart on the right hand side of Slide 50. Another element of our self-funding strategy is economic development and slide 16, illustrates our success in attracting new industrial activity to our service territory over the past several years, which is augmented steady organic growth in our residential and commercial segments. As highlighted in Q1, we're targeting 100 megawatts of new load in 2019 and continue to trend on plan with 50 megawatts secured through the first half of the year. We also continue to see attractive levels in diversity in our new load, which is reflective of our electric service territory. As you'll note in the pie chart on the right-hand side of the page, in 2018 approximately 2% of our customer contributions came from the auto industry. As we continue to invest capital and manage customer prices, we are also dedicated to maintaining a healthy balance sheet and robust access to capital markets. On slide 17, we have a snapshot of our credit ratings at the utility, and the parent and I'm pleased to report that the positive trend continues. Moody's recently reaffirmed their ratings, the utility secured bonds, and the parent company's senior unsecured bonds at Aa3 and Baa1 respectively. It's also recently reaffirmed their strong ratings for the utility secured bonds at 8+. And S&P sits nicely with a single A for the utility secured bonds and a triple B rating the parent senior unsecured bonds. These ratings are reflective of our strong balance sheet and operating cash flow generation, which reduces cost for our customers and fund our capital plan efficiently to the benefit of investors. And with that, I'll pass it back to Patti for some concluding remarks before Q&A. Patti Poppe : Thanks. Reggie. We believe we have a compelling investment thesis that will serve our customers and investors for years to come. And with that, Rocco please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you very much, Patti. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Sullivan of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Michael Sullivan : Hey, everyone. Good morning. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Michael. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Michael. Michael Sullivan : Hey, so just first I think in Q1, you guys described, the year is tracking, I think, $0.01 better relative to plan and now in Q2, it seems like pretty much on plan even with some of these headwinds in Q1 and then the tailwinds in Q2. I guess, can you just give us a little more detail on what the additional levers you have to pull in case weather is below normal or worse than normal in the second half of the year, since it looks like you're just budgeting for normal? Rejji Hayes : Sure, Michael. So, very good question. And as always, I would just start by saying, whenever we prepare a financial plan for any given year, we make sure that first and foremost, we plan conservative, but also our plan has sufficient contingency across a number of working assumption to make sure that in the event weather is sub-optimal, in the event there is a sub-optimal regulatory outcome that we have enough cushion to provide for again any downside case. And so again, as we always say, we do that we're the investment community and that's where our plan reflects. And so as you think about the first couple of quarters that we've had, we're $0.01 ahead, and we feel like we're on plan at this point even with, I'll say mild weather in June as well as a strong activity in Q1. And so, we have managed the cost as we always have, and that includes a number of, I'll say, opportunities that we execute on over the course of the year. So we've been very advantageous on the non-operating side. So we've done refinancings that have provided cost savings in excess of plan. And so we did take our bond in Q2 that provided savings that we hadn't anticipated. We've also found some tax planning opportunities that have created additional upside. And then the operating side, we continue to look at opportunities through deferral potential spend opportunities for stretch goals and things of that nature. So there are always flex down opportunities that we look out over the course of the year that we will execute on, if we see downside. Patti Poppe : And Michael, I'll add that we really have ramped up our waste elimination work. It is our play of the year for the CUA, and it's the power of the CUA. We've been -- we're in really our third full year of implementation, and we are feeling the benefits of being able to deploy a new capability quickly across the organization, and that's what's important about running a lean operation, and a lean operation you can adapt to changing conditions. So the conditions this year are able to benefit from the great work that we did in '18 to pull ahead expenses. And so as Reggie described, pulling ahead maintenance in 2018 has allowed us to defer other maintenance that might have otherwise been done in this 12-month period because we did it early. But more importantly, I would say the capability we are building around waste elimination, and just imagine our thousands of employees all across the state, learning how to see and eliminate waste. Simple things like how we stuff the bills at the billing and mailing center for our bills. When we do construction projects, a contractor picks up their equipment. Rental fees on the equipment, when we don't in a timely basis, get them to come pick up their equipment can pile up. So, we've improved our process simply to make sure that the rental equipment gets off our property, and off our books, and off our ledger as quickly as possible. So it's little things all across the state that add up and allow us to be more nimble as conditions like this change and I would even offer in this most recent storm that we just experienced here in Michigan. Our storm response was extraordinary. We were able to get our contractors off the system faster, we were able to get mutual assistance optic system faster because we have done a lot of work utilizing the CUA to improve our processes, and improve our storm response because it's such a major part of the customer experience. So all those little things add up and create this nimbleness and provide the confidence that we have that this back-end loaded part of our plan leverages last year's favorable unplanned conditions, to deal with unplanned negative conditions that occur this year that are outside of our control. What we can control is how we respond and we're doing that extraordinarily well. Michael Sullivan : Great, and thanks for the color there. And just to clarify, as a follow-up, the July sales that you're showing there benefit that's -- you guys are also factoring in any sort of headwind that you may have experienced from the storms over the last weekend? Rejji Hayes : So the $0.04 that I highlighted in my prepared remarks, that reflects the gross sales that we realized as a result of at least the July weather we've seen to-date. The impact of the storm for our preliminary estimates is about $8 million of O&M, and I'd say that's about a couple of cents and so our $0.04 of upside for the July weather did not take that into account. But again, going back to my initial comments, we do plan for contingency for a number of our, I'll say, cost buckets including storms and so we do have contingency in our service restoration cost assumptions for the year, which will absorb the cost of that storm. So we still feel good about the July upside that I articulated. Michael Sullivan : Okay, great. And then one final one, just flipping over to the regulatory side, I think you've got an ALJ decision due in the gas rate case next week, I was just curious how you're feeling about that and potential for settlement given it seemed parties weren't too far apart? And then just kind of going forward, I see you're going to file again shortly thereafter, and just how you're thinking about maybe being able to space out the cadence of rate cases over the long-term going forward? Patti Poppe : Yeah, one thing that became abundantly clear -- is abundantly clear through the staff's position on this gas rate case, Michael, is that there is a strong support for gas investment. The safety of our system, the age of our system warrants strong and diligent attention. And so that's why I think you would see that in that staff position, we were very close. In fact the rate base that they recommended and we requested, was the same at $6.5 billion. So we feel good about that. Sometimes, it's good to let a final order go all the way, let a case go all the way to a final order. We have had success with settlements and I think that that's been representative of the constructive regulatory treatment, and environment here in Michigan, and our relationship with all of the extended parties who participate in a rate filing. But we think going potentially to a final order in this case would not be a risky outcome given our mutual commitment for gas investment. We do anticipate filing our next case in the fourth quarter of this year, and that's simply because we have so much work to do on the gas system to make it safe. And the good news is over the last five years, for example, we've reduced customers' bills by 28%, driven both by the commodity price, but also the cost savings that we've delivered on the gas side of the business. So our unit costs for all of the work that we do continue to decline as we implement the CE Way, and we're able to do more work for less dollars, get more value-added for customers, and that's important because of the volume of work that the system really does require these days. So we do anticipate filing another case at the latter half of this year -- fourth quarter of this year. Michael Sullivan : Great, thanks a lot. Patti Poppe : Yeah. Thanks, Michael. Operator : And our next question today comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Hey, good morning. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Greg. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon : So I know you specifically -- Rejji you specifically address this in part on the call when you talked about sales growth for the year, that you're seeing reasonably good strength and higher margin residential sales, but have you seen lag on commercial and industrial sales relative to what your plan was. And is that -- if so, or if not, how is that related or not related to what's going on with trade tariffs, et cetera and pressure we're seeing on the auto industry? Rejji Hayes : Yeah, good question, Greg. So I would say, first, let me start with the commercial side. We actually have been quite encouraged with the commercial activity we've seen relative to plan and so when we talk about favorable mix it's not just residential, but also commercial. And so commercial actuals to date, still exceed our expectation along with residential. And so I'll point you to the numbers that we have in our disclosure. But we're about 0.5% down in the weather not normalized basis year-to-date versus 2018. As we've said in the past, that's net of our energy efficiency programs so obviously when you gross up the 1.5% reduction in customer uses that we work to achieve every year. We're actually up about a point on commercial, and so the customer accounts really would go to on the commercial side. We're up about 1% on a rolling LTM basis, and so customer counts are for commercial and residential. And then for industrial while we've seen a little bit of softness there down about 2% with energy efficiency included in that about 0.5% growth, so taking out energy efficiency. We're actually seeing a pretty good story from our smaller industrial customers, because if you take out basically one large low margin customer were basically flat net of energy efficiency, and so if you think about that again excluding energy efficiency, up about 1.5%. So we continue to be encouraged by the trends we're seeing across all of our customer classes. I do think there is a little bit of a slowdown we're seeing at least for the first part of year, for some of our larger industrial customers and whether that has to do with trade wars or broader economic effects, I think remains to be seen. We always highlight in the upper left hand corner of that sales slide that we're continuing to see very good trends economically and Grand Rapids, which is in the heart of our service territory. And so whether it's GDP, whether it's unemployment, population growth, building permits, all of that continues to trend quite well. So we still think it's a very nice economic story in our service territory, and I think it's too early to tell whether there are any broader macro themes taking place nationally or globally. Greg Gordon : Great, thank you. Clear. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Eric Lee of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead. Aric Li : Hi, good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Eric. Aric Li : Hey, so just shifting gears a little bit in terms of thinking about the longer term opportunity ahead. Could you speak a bit to renewable prospects beyond the initial 1.1 gigawatts laid out in IRP approval as well as just maybe the PPA earning aspects in regard to that, I think, the longer-term mix for rate base and PPA there? Patti Poppe : Sure. Obviously, our IRP paints a very clear picture of by year when we'll be adding these additional 6,000 megawatts of specifically solar, while we are also doing the demand response and energy efficiency to soften the peak and reduce that demand that's required on peak that the whole system is built around. And so as we look at our 6,000 megawatt path, it was important that we build the plan to pre-build that solar before the big PPA at MCV and the remaining coal plants come offline. We need to make sure that that solar is installed, working as plan, that we've learned how to optimize and dispatch that much solar across our system. And so we have a pretty methodical plan, as we go across actually the years. In the neighborhood of 300 to 500 megawatts of solar beginning in 2021 and going all the way to 2030, we end at 600 megawatts of solar by 2030 per year. So that ends up then when you add all of that up, that 6,000 megawatts total of solar by the end of our 2040 IRP time horizon. So you can see it's pretty systemic. Now keep in mind that one of the great things that we negotiated in our IRP settlement, is this agreement that we would build half and rate base that half of the solar and that's through potentially build on transfer, perhaps we'll build it ourselves. We're going to have to do -- we in fact want to do an annual RFP to set the proper price for that new solar being added to the system, which really bodes well for customers and allows us to make sure we have the lowest cost new solar every single year taking advantage of the cost curve, and the technology curves in solar. The other half then would be built by others and we would then earn our financial compensation mechanism, which is currently at 5.88%, which is unknown proclamation of our weighted average cost of capital to as a financial compensation mechanism on top of the price of those PPAs. So we think it's very good on many fronts and most importantly sets a level playing field here in Michigan for the implementation of new solar that's to the benefit of both the planet, and our customers, and therefore then our investors through both the financial compensation mechanism in the fact that we will be rate basing half of that. Aric Li : Got it. And just quickly in regards to that. Is there a potential for perhaps beyond the initial 1.1 more rate base or even maybe say a higher FCM? Patti Poppe : We re-file the IRP anywhere from every -- we're required by law to file it within five years. We agreed in our settlement to file another IRP in three years. And I can't predict what will come out of that settlement or another IRP. Rather we'll obviously always look to adapt and change as conditions change, as the market changes to the benefit of customers and investors. And so each filing that we do will of course have opportunities to improve the framework. Aric Li : Got it. And when should we think about storage spend kicking in more meaningfully? I know you've spent some time on that earlier. Patti Poppe : Yeah, right now we have it at the latter part. We have 450MW at the latter part of the IRP and personally your guess is as good as mine, but I would be shocked if sometime in the next 20 years, there is some breakthrough in storage, given the commitment of automakers to electric vehicles does create a marketplace for technology, and R&D, and storage. We are so closely linked to that our US automakers here in Michigan and our partnership with GM, and Ford, and Chrysler has been very strong. And so we will, I think, be in a position to take advantage of smart storage a sooner than later. We have a pilot. We're running this summer with residential storage application. We've got a couple of batteries installed at some commercial locations. We're doing a lot of learning and I forecast that as we filed subsequent IRPs will be able to model additional reductions in costs on storage going forward. We're hopeful for that, because we think it will be a better way to balance the system over time with renewable energy as a primary energy source. Aric Li : Great. Good to hear. And one last question and I'll shift back to the queue. What do you think about the potential for maybe accelerated coal retirements and your renewable development given potential appetite at the MPSC? Patti Poppe : We did a lot of studying in our plan about the right timeline for our current -- our remaining coal plant retirements. Of course, again every IRP will consider. But here something really important to remember with the coal plant retirements. I have co-workers there who have dedicated their lives to delivering energy for the people of Michigan. And so, both for our coworkers and the communities where those plants, an important tax base, it's important that we recognize that giving them an accurate date of closure, so they can plan their lives, so those communities can plan for redevelopment. It's important that we stick to the plan that we published, so that they don't feel like we're taking advantage of them. And so when we talk about our triple-bottom line of serving people, the planet, and profit. This people aspect of the transformation of our energy system is equally important to serving the planet, and then delivering earnings for our investors. So that is a key component of driving the timeline. And frankly, we also have to build out all the solar and make sure it works as intended, and make sure that we have the capacity that we need when we retire those plants. So those two factors really do drive our current timing. And we feel good about the current timing. We think it's well ahead of -- much of the country will end up with an 80% carbon reduction by 2030, and 90% -- over 90% carbon reduction by 2040 that's a decade ahead of the peer\u2019s climate core, that's a decade ahead of most -- many of our peers. And so we do feel like our aggressive actions that we've taken to date, retiring a gigawatt of coal already, does reiterate our commitment to the planet. But we also think the triple bottom line is important in the execution. Rejji Hayes : Eric, the only thing I would add an additional to all Patti's good remarks around the resource adequacy operational employee, I'd say implications of an accelerated call shutdown. There also is a consideration from a balance sheet perspective, and so you still have Moody's, which continues to include securitizations in their credit metric calculation. And so you could definitely anticipate a scenario, which you had an accelerated coal retirement plan that led to a significant levering of the balance sheet, because remember, when you securitize these assets, they effectively get 100% funded by debt. So while, do you still have that constraint in place, I think it really does hamper any accelerated coal retirement case. And so that's also keeping strength worth noting. Aric Li : I appreciate your time. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Eric. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hi guys, good morning. Rejji Hayes : Hey, Michael. Patti Poppe : Hey, Michael. Michael Weinstein : Hey, my question is about the long-term capital plan in light of, with the IRP approved. I'm just wondering at what point do you anticipate at this time rolling that into the long-term plan, the 10-year plan -- and can you -- what can you say about it now in advance of the official rolling out of those numbers? Rejji Hayes : Yeah, Michael. I would say, as from our prepared remarks, we anticipate at some point in the 4th quarter will provide color on a new 10-year plan. So I would say it would either be on our Q3 call which takes place in the 4th quarter or potentially EEI, but it will be one of those two scenarios, most likely. And as we said in the past, our expectations are at least quite high that it will be in excess of the prior 10-year plan that was rolled out in September, 17 of about $18 billion or reaffirmed during the Investor Day. And so, we'll be in excess of that given the opportunities afforded by the IRP, but we also have a significant capital investment backlog as we've talked about in the past on our wires and pipes. So both of the electric and gas distribution systems. And so we do think there are incremental capital investment opportunities, and the key constraint will be customer affordability, as well as balance sheet, and workforce constraints. And so we have to make sure that all of that works out. So we're going through the math for the front end of our planning cycle, the IRP was a gating item which is now behind us. But we have to go through all of those machinations and things that our customers can afford, as well as our investors and employees. Well, we can get from an operational perspective. So those are all the key things we're thinking through. Michael Weinstein : I mean, as you --- and your thought process on the 6% to 8% growth rate is that would be unchanged even with a higher plan. Right? Rejji Hayes : No, we don't provide EPS guidance beyond a five-year period. So the current five-year plan of $11 billion, that from our perspective can deliver 6% to 8% EPS growth. And I wouldn't even suggest that when we rollout a 10-year plan we'll provide 10-year EPS guidance. Because I think that maybe unprecedented, we are fortune 500 company. So we'll see where we end up, but we are planning of a five-year plan in Q1 of next year that will likely have some estimate around EPS growth and for 10-year plan that will just be on the capital side, but not much color beyond that. Michael Weinstein : All right, thanks. You guys are -- have always been trend setters. So you never know, right? Rejji Hayes : Well said, Michael. Patti Poppe : Nice, Michael. Nice quote, we hear you. Michael Weinstein : All right. Thanks a lot. Patti Poppe : All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta : Hi guys. Patti Poppe : Hi, Praful. Hey, Praful. Praful Mehta : Hi. So may be firstly on the, the cost part and the O&M. Because clearly in 2019 you're benefiting from some of the stuff that you did in 2018 to push cost around. How should we think about going forward from a profile perspective? Given -- if you have in a reduced cost in 2019, does that mean that we should think about that going up back again in 2020? Just from a profile perspective, how do we think about those costs? Rejji Hayes : No. I think, Praful, really 2018 should not be viewed as any sort of comp for future years. And that's why it's difficult. When you think about the way in which we manage the business, the way in which we manage the work, 2018 obviously we had almost $100 million of weather driven upside. And so we really ramped up the operating and non-operating pull-aheads of the course that year, which is why we're I think just under a billion in one of O&M costs, and this year we expect to be well below that. So when we think about the baseline, when we look at what we budgeted for 2019 and we'll try to take 2% to 3% off of that as we often do on a net basis, and that will dictate where we end up for the 2020 plan and beyond. And as we think about just in general, our cost structure, there really are kind of two approaches for how we think about our financial planning. There are planned cost savings that incorporated into our budget. So we look at non-operating and operating opportunities like waste elimination as Patti highlighted. We've talked about attrition management in the past tax planning revise. And then we have planned initiatives during the year. So we're doing a lot of work in the supply chain to take advantage of economies of scale, IT solutions adding more automation across the organization to realize cost. Those are planned opportunities that we incorporate in the budget. And then in to a year, as we get into a year, we see, I'll say, unforeseen sources of upside or downside then we flex. And so a year like this year, where we've seen historical levels of service restoration cost attributable to storms, as well as mild weather. That's when we start looking at things like, okay should we defer some ambitious plans we have that are strategic or operational in nature that we will not need to be done this year; do we look at things around non-compliance opportunities on the training side. So, that's when we start to look at into a year opportunity. But generally the baseline is usually what has been planned for in the current year and then we try to take 2% to 3% off of that. So 2018 really isn't a proxy for what a run rate O&M is for us. Is that helpful? Praful Mehta : Yeah, that's very helpful. Thanks Rejji. Good detailed color, which always is helpful. And then maybe secondly on the credit side. And you talked Rejji, a little bit about the securitization. Also I think the PTAs could get imputed as debt from a rating agency perspective. So how should we think about the credit and the equity needs going forward? You've clearly benefited from some of the tax pieces that you've got in terms of AMT credits. But going forward, how should we think about that in the 150 a year in terms of equity, is that still kind of the plan, or do you see that moving around a little bit? Rejji Hayes : Yeah. We will want to see. I mean obviously we've just commenced our five-year planning cycle, and so we're not going to roll-out a new five-year plan until Q1 of next year. That will incorporate, I'll say, some of the implications around the IRP, and Karn, and some of the puts and takes. I still generally believe that our five-year plan will look very similar to the current plan, we were maybe a little over $11 billion. But will have I'll say relatively modest amount of equity issuances per year. That allow us to keep the credit metric range of, call it 17% to 18% FFO to debt. So remember we have managed the balance sheet, very conservatively for the last several years, when we do have really hospitable capital markets. We didn't go on M&A binge, we didn't do any levered repos, we just chipped away at our balance sheet with equity issuances to fund our capital plans and grew the business organically. And so even post-tax reform, that's given us a lot of latitude to continue to modestly fund the business with equity. And we think even if there is a Karn, or when there is a Karn retirement in the securitization besides of that, it shouldn't really balloon out our equity needs. And remember with the PPAs, even though there will be a levering effect of that, the financial compensation mechanism does partially offset that, because we will get earnings on those PPAs and that's in fact part of the reason why we structured it that way. So we feel very good about the balance sheet going forward, but it's premature to talk about exactly what the equity needs will be until we rollout our new 5-year plan in Q1 of next year. Praful Mehta : Got you. Again, super helpful with the detail. But so we should think about it in the range of the same 150, is that still fair? Rejji Hayes : I think, directionally that's correct. But I will be more precise clearly when we roll out the plan next year. Praful Mehta : Got it. Thanks so much guys. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller : Good morning. Thank you. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Travis. Travis Miller : I was wondering if outside of the utility now, if you could update strategic direction thoughts there for enterprises, and then also if anything has changed with EnerBank? Patti Poppe : Yeah, nothing new on EnerBank, yes, we've repeated the last couple of calls. No new news there. They continue to be a part of our portfolio, a very small part that is relatively essentially self-funded, and so no changes there. Enterprises, you'll have noticed that they've done a couple of new renewable projects, very small, very targeted, customer driven. They've been driven by customers approaching us that we have starved, and either our enterprises business or our utility business outside of our regulated service area. And so we've been able to meet the needs of say, Lansing Board of Water & Light with a 24 megawatt solar installation there, 105 megawatts of wind in Ohio for General Motors. But those are more opportunistic in nature and we do feel well positioned. We like to say we're big enough to matter, but small enough to care. And for example in Lansing -- Lansing Board of Water & Light is right here in Michigan, and they had multiple developers go out of business in their attempt to install and build out this wind -- this solar project. And so we have the capability of doing those projects, but we don't show up in our private jets. We drive our load truck over from across the street, and help them do their work. And that's a good positioning for us and for enterprises. And so where we do have additional projects, we want enterprises to grow as the utility growth and -- but don't be confused, our utility business is the primary driver of earnings and our plans for growth. Travis Miller : Okay, great. And then just two quick on Enterprises based on what you said there. One is, what do you think that market is large, do you think that market is for customers coming to you presumably wanting the renewables in the future? And then also, would enterprises be eligible to apply for some of those or participate in the RFPs on the utility side? Patti Poppe : Yeah. Your second question first, our affiliate is not allowed to compete for the renewable projects. But I would also offer -- we don't have an eye on the specific market size because again, as I mentioned, we're really opportunistic as these projects come to us and more so, what I can tell you, though is there a lot of our utility customers, large industrial brands that you would recognize that we made commitments to 100% renewable energy. And we've been able to provide a large customer tariff with the utility, so they don't have to rely on our non-utility business. But in other states we have opportunities to serve those very same customers. But again, we don't have -- it's not -- we're not in hunt of that, it really does come to us opportunistically. Travis Miller : Okay, great. I appreciate it. Operator : And our next question today comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Good morning. Patti Poppe : Morning, Paul Rejji Hayes : Morning, Paul. Paul Patterson : I'm going to ask you to just go over again sort of Greg Gordon's question on sales growth, I was a little bit, I just want to make sure I fully understand it. Could you once again just sort of go through what your weather-adjusted sales growth has been and how much energy efficiencies impacting it? And, I guess, how much energy efficiency that you guys, your programs, your utility sponsored programs are responsible for? Rejji Hayes : Absolutely. And let me point here as well Paul, to the materials that came out with the press release, Slide of Page 13 and 14 that has or weather-normalized electric utility statistics-- Paul Patterson : Right. I have been looking at them. Rejji Hayes : --you can also look at that those for reference. But I'll reiterate. So, what we've seen year-to-date relative to the first half of 2018, for residential were down 0.5%, commercial down 0.5%, and industrial were down just under 2% at 1.9%. And those numbers again are weather normalized. They also take into account the reduction of customer usage favorable to our energy efficiency programs. And so, by design, we look to reduce electric power from the prior year by 1.5%, and we get economic incentives to do so. And so, very effective, really going back to 2008 law, and executing on those plans. And so, I always try to highlight that the reduction in customer usage is incorporated into those numbers. And so it acts that how for back, the effects of those programs out you can really add 1.5% to the numbers, you will see on that page. And so, think about that financial down 0.5% on a gross basis, excluding the energy efficiency programs are up a point, same for commercial, and then industrial down about 0.5%, again grossed up for the effects of energy efficiency. And so that's how we think about it, not on a blended basis, we're down about a little under 1%. And so again, grossing that up, you're a little over 0.5% when you exclude the energy efficiency. So that's what we think about it. And we also look at the customer accounts just to make sure that what we believe is segment place across residential, commercial does reflect those grossed up numbers and so we've seen customer counts go up for residential down 0.5%. On a rolling latest 12 months basis, we've seen commercial up about a percent. And so we're seeing very nice trends there. And the other point I have made in the past and I'll make it again, is that weather normalization math is a very complicated and imperfect science. And so if you take into account some of the, I'll say, weather extremes we saw last year and tried to back that out as hard as our folks work to get that math right, it's still quite complicated. And so that's why while we state these numbers and report them, they are not always as perfect or precise as we'd like them to be. And then for industrial the only other point I'd make, there is that we continue to see good performance from our small industrial customers. And so we have seen, if you carve out one large low-margin customer, and you can actually effectively add about 1% to our blended electric weather normalized sales performance. So like I said, we're down about a little less than 1% weather normalized, and when you take out that one large low-margin customer we're basically flat in our industrial or as much as that is a little below 2%, you take out that one large customer were up over a percent. And so we have seen just very good performance across our customer classes and particularly when you exclude the effects of our energy efficiency programs, which are designed to reduce customer usage. Is that helpful Paul? Paul Patterson : Yeah, that is helpful. And I didn't want to belabor it, I just want to make sure that I understood that that 1.5% is based on your utility energy efficiency efforts. Rejji Hayes : That's exactly right. Paul Patterson : Okay. Okay. And now, just one sort of quick follow-up on that. on the gas side, I know it's a small quarter for gas usage, but it did seem to grow pretty rapidly I think that's on Page 14 or I have to agree -- let me find it. But if you follow what I'm saying, the residential grew like 14.3% and 8.3% for commercial. I just was wondering, is there anything going on there? I mean, it just seems like a relatively high number on a weather-normalized basis. Rejji Hayes : Yeah. So I'll first go again point to the weather normalized math and the imperfections. But we've actually seen pretty good customer accounts across gas as well. And so we do think that part due to what I will say that a positive spillover effects when you have good industrial activity. And so you start with decent industrial activity, that leads to residential increases, and then you get commercial activity, and so there is a very nice spillover effect taking place in gas and I think that's what we're seeing in these numbers. But again, I want to temper expectations both on the downside and the upside. It's a very difficult piece of math to employ. Paul Patterson : I follow you. It just sort of jumped out of me. Okay. I understand to take it with a grain of thought I guess to a certain degree. But, okay. Thanks so much guys. All my other questions were answered, and have a great one. Patti Poppe : Thanks Paul. Rejji Hayes : Thanks, Paul. See you. Operator : And our next question comes from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Fishman : Hi, guys. Good morning. Patti Poppe : Hey, David. Rejji Hayes : Hey, David. David Fishman : Hi. Just going back to a little bit of the long-term CapEx guidance that we might receive. Should we expect to see a gas distribution investment plan, sort of similar to what we saw with the EBIT for electric that potentially outlines long-term opportunity there, kind of with an expanded IRM in mind. Patti Poppe : Yes, you should. We're working on that as we speak, which is another reason why we're going to wait till the latter half of the year to publish the 10-year plan. I can't promise that it will result in an IRM. But I do think that it will paint a nice clear picture. And I think our commission has done a really good job of soliciting these plans, these multi-year plans, so that as they're making an annual determination during a rate case, they have a better perspective of where it fits into a longer-term plan. And frankly, they can't hold us accountable even if it's not a formal program to doing what we said we're going to do, and we're up for that kind of scrutiny because we're pretty good at planning, and we want to be able to be trusted in our ability to execute. So we've been working on a long-term gas plan. We know how important the safety of the system is for the state of Michigan. And so, we'll look forward to sharing that more publicly over the next year or so. David Fishman : Okay. So that's something for over the next year or so not necessarily alongside long term CapEx plan? Patti Poppe : Some of it might be published with our long-term CapEx plan. It definitely is the key driver for it. But we may wait until early 2020 to formally publish it. David Fishman : That makes sense. And then one quick housekeeping item. Just on the year-over-year drivers slide, I think you added a more explicit $0.08 of enterprises benefit. I just wanted to make sure I knew all the drivers, that's mostly because the MISO capacity rolls off into better negotiate capacity contracts. And then how much of that proportionally is about the new energy contracts versus maybe the incremental Ohio wind farm? Rejji Hayes : Yeah. So you have a few pieces there. I think you highlighted, the largest driver. And so as you roll off of the MISO planning resource auction of 2018, and its implications in the back half of the year, you start to see capacity sales tick up. I can't give you the earnings per share. But it's a vast majority of that pick up and then you have two other components. So you rightfully noted some of the effects of Northwest, Ohio. It's interesting that our wind project was fun. The implication there is that their production tax credits that we expected to realize resulting from that project earlier in the year, but because we had a slow start for enterprises, we didn't actually realize the effects of the production tax credits at enterprises in the first half year. So we'll pick that up. Also in the second half of the year and the last thing I'll note, is if you think about the comp relative to 2018, we did have a write-off in the second half of the year of about $3.5 million attributable to file our city, because we were no longer planning to convert that plant from coal to natural gas. And so the absence of that write-off, we spent $3.5 million pre-tax. That's about a penny. And then you've got, I think the vast majority of the capacity sales as well as the realization of production tax credit. So it's those three things that largely get you back our planned EPS contribution of $0.14 from enterprises for the year. David Fishman : Okay, that's great color. And yeah, those are my questions. Congrats again on a great first half. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Patti Poppe : Thanks, David. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Poppe for any closing remarks. Patti Poppe : Thanks everyone, for joining us again this morning. And certainly, we look forward to seeing you out and about at upcoming events.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy\u2019s website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 PM Eastern Time running through October 31. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy\u2019s website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sri Maddipati : Thanks, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Patti. Patti Poppe : Thank you, Sri. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. This morning I\u2019ll share our financial results and outlook for the first nine months of the year, I\u2019ll introduce our 2020 guidance and review our new 10-year capital plan. Rejji will add more details on our financial results, and of course as always, we\u2019ll close with Q&A. Through the first nine months of the year, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share. This keeps us on track to meet our year-end guidance of $2.47 to $2.51 per share with a bias to the midpoint. We\u2019ll continue to manage the work and adapt to changing conditions in the final quarter of this year as we do every year to deliver the results you expect. We\u2019re also introducing our 2020 guidance of $2.53 to $2.68, which is up 6% to 8% from the midpoint of this year\u2019s guidance range. As always, we\u2019ll update this initial guidance on our year-end call from our 2019 actual results. We continue to reiterate our long-term adjusted EPS and dividend growth of 6% to 8%. I\u2019m excited to introduce our new $25 billion 10-year capital plan. We\u2019ve also revised our five-year plan, which reflects our forecasted capital investments from 2019 to 2023 to introduce to include the addition of approximately $600 million of solar investments over this period as approved in our IRP. This new 10-year plan is the result of a lot of hard work from our teams to come up with the real operating plans that we can execute, including identifying the investments that will drive the highest value for our customers, in both safety and reliability as well as cost. We\u2019ve identified not only the system needs, but the pacing of the needed engineering, equipment and the personnel to deliver a system that can meet the energy needs of our customers. There is no question that our electric and gas systems need upgrades well beyond normal maintenance, including accelerated electric reliability investments and enhanced infrastructure replacements for gas. Even though we\u2019re planning to invest $25 billion, we know there are more investment opportunities. We continue to plan conservatively based on customer affordability, the level of workforce will need to complete the work and balance sheet constraints. As we execute our plan, we\u2019ll look to incorporate more of these opportunities over time. The extent cost management allows, you could see some of that upside rolling into the plan and that $25 billion looking something more like $28 billion to $29 billion of total capital investment. That is what you see on the right side of this slide. These items are additive to the plan depending on future rate case approvals. Our new 10-year capital plan will help us deliver safe and reliable energy to our customers for years to come, and it couldn\u2019t be done without the capital that you all provide. This plan supports our long-term growth objectives and reflects our commitment to deliver for our customers and our investors. 2019 has been a productive and successful year on the regulatory front. The gas rate order demonstrates a high level of alignment with our commission on the amount of investment required to keep our systems safe and reliable. We received over 98% of our requests, which resulted in $6.4 billion of rate base. We plan to file our next gas rate case by the end of this year and our electric rate case in the early part of next year. We\u2019ll expect an order in both cases 10 months following those filings as is required by the 2016 energy law. And now my favorite slide, the story of the month. Our triple bottom line is being noticed by our customers and the communities we serve. There\u2019s nothing more gratifying than having our customers recognize our efforts by awarding us the number one JD Power Ranking for residential gas in the Midwest. Our increased investments in the safety and reliability of our gas system, the rollout of our automated gas meter reading to improve the accuracy of our bills, and our application of the CE Way to dramatically improve our first time quality and on time delivery of customer requested service, have all contributed to our movement from the fourth quartile to number one in 2019. It\u2019s also worth noting that we have managed to reduce our residential gas bills by over 30% in the five years while making these significant investments. I was in Battle Creek last week at the Sunrise Rotary Club meeting. And over scrambled eggs and a cup of coffee, I had a chance to chat with the leaders of the Michigan Home Builders Association. They shared with me that they are experiencing the progress our team has made in meeting increasing demand for new services. I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that there was a time just a couple of years ago when we didn\u2019t even measure on time delivery, and when we started we were only on time 9% of the time. Now we are up to 95% on time for our three-hour windows. That\u2019s not lucky. That\u2019s hard work and the application of our CE Way to improve performance that much. The home builders told me that our timing could not have been better with continuously rising new home service. We\u2019re fueling Michigan\u2019s prosperity with our delivery of hometown service. It was heartwarming to hear from such an important organization that they noticed and we\u2019re thankful for our improvements. We\u2019ve come a long way and yet so far left to go, but we are proud to be on the top of the Midwest ranking for our gas customers. We are still dissatisfied. We know our customers expect great service and we\u2019ll do our part to continually improve their experience. In addition to our focus on people, we\u2019re equally committed to the second leg of our triple bottom line, the planet. To that end, we are proud to announce today that we\u2019ve established a voluntary net zero methane emissions goal by 2030 for our gas distribution system. To achieve our goal, we\u2019ll continue to accelerate the replacement programs we already have in place, protect our assets with increased damage prevention and apply new technologies to identify and eliminate fugitive methane emissions. With these efforts, we can get an 80% methane reduction and to get to net zero by 2030, we\u2019re planning to use renewable natural gas as part of our total gas supply. When we make capital investments in our system, we fully demonstrate our triple bottom line. We serve people, our planet and profit. It is the best long-term business philosophy to fulfill our purpose, world-class performance, delivering hometown service. This triple bottom line has served our model well, and allows us to perform consistently regardless of weather conditions, the economy or other external factors. Our track record demonstrates our ability to deliver consistent, premium results year after year after year. And this year, you can expect the same. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As posted earlier this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $207 million, which translates to $0.73 per share. Our results for the quarter compared favorably to the third quarter of 2018 by $0.14, and as Patti highlighted, keep us on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. On a year-to-date basis, we have delivered $514 million of adjusted net income, or $1 81 per share. We\u2019re just $0.12 per share lower in our financial results over the same period in 2018. This is largely driven by the absence of the favorable weather we experienced in 2018, and the substantial storm activity we experienced throughout the year. As we\u2019ve been highlighting all year, we planned for back-end loaded 2019, given the timing of our gas rate case and last year\u2019s cost flag among other factors. And we remain on track with our plan to achieve our full year EPS guidance. As always, we\u2019ll continue to plan conservatively and manage the work to meet our operational and financial objectives, as we have done every year for the past several years. On Slide 10, you could see that most of the negative variance year-over-year has come from last year\u2019s favorable weather rolling off and higher service restoration costs incurred in 2019 attributable to storm. These headwinds have been partially offset by rate relief, net of investments, favorable sales mix, and strong cost performance to achieve your ongoing and planned initiatives such as attrition management, improve productivity via the CE Way and supply chain optimization to name a few. These anticipated cost control measures have also been supplemented with opportunities, which reflects during the year, such as the deferral of discretionary projects, strong tax planning, timely refinancing in opportunistic assets sales. As always, we adapt to the changing circumstances required and make sure we have adequate levels of risk mitigation in our plan to meet our financial objectives year in-and year-out. As you\u2019ll note, our catchall bar in the middle of the page labeled usage, enterprises, taxes and other, highlights $0.02 per share, of favorable variance versus the comparable period in 2018. During our second quarter call, this bar should $0.15 per share of negative variance to net $0.17 swing has largely been driven by the affirmation factors, which exemplifies our strengths in managing the business as we match unexpected and at times and uncontrollable headlines with positive option. As we look to the fourth quarter, much of the tailwinds we anticipate in the second half of the year will come to fruition, and we remain confident in our ability to meet our EPS guidance for the year. Our Q4 glide path assumes that the absence of favorable weather in 2018 would more than offset by the substantial reinvestments or pull ahead, that we made in Q4 2018, which equates to $0.15 of net positive variance in 2019. We also anticipate additional $0.13 for rate relief driven favorability with our gas rate case now in the rearview mirror and some modest growth from a non utility businesses. That said, we\u2019ll take none of this for granted and we\u2019ll approach these last two months of the year with the usual degree of paranoia, by continuing to maintain our cost discipline and flex additional opportunities as needed to deliver the consistent financial results you\u2019ll come to expect. Slide 11 is a great reminder of how we manage the work and capitalize on flex opportunities during the year to deliver for our customers and investors. We\u2019ve been able to maintain this consistency by being agile and constantly scrubbing our plans for risk and opportunities. In the years, where we have had favor ability, we prioritize reinvestment opportunities in year such as this or you\u2019ve seen suboptimal weather and higher storm costs. We lean on our ability to manage the work and identify and execute on risk mitigation opportunities into year. At times these opportunities can be episodic like some of the savings we have achieved the past on benefits and tax rate items, and this year is really no different. We\u2019ve been using this slide now for the past several years because it epitomizes what we do here at CMS. We anticipate the volatility, which is represented by the curvy blue line and manage that volatility every year to ensure that you, our investors continue to experience the consistent industry leading financial performance, illustrated by the upward sloping linear green line has been our trademark for over a decade now. In short, we do the worrying so you don\u2019t have to. This is all made possible by self-funding strategy to pick it on Slide 12. Our focus on cost controls, and proactive risk management to fund our capital investments and mitigate in three year volatility, underpin our simple but unique business model enables us to meet our financial objectives every year. With a robust backlog of capital investments, we can improve the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems for our customers while driving earnings growth for our investors. And this growth is largely funded through cost cutting, tax planning, economic development, and modest nonutility contribution, all efforts, which meeting sustainable long run. As such, we are confident that we can continue to improve customers experience to capital investments, while meeting our affordability and environmental targets for many years to come. As we plan for the future. One of the primary constraints of our long-term capital investment plan will be customer portability, and we have taken this into account in the formulation of our new 10 year capital plan. As we\u2019ve highlighted in the past, we have substantial cost reduction opportunities throughout our $5 billion plus cost structure through the expiration of high priced power purchase agreements, the gradual retirement of our full fleet, capital enabled savings as we modernize our electric and gas distribution systems. And lastly, the CE Way which will serve as the key pillar of our cost reduction strategy over time as we eliminate waste throughout the organization. These efforts will provide a sustainable funding strategy for our five and 10 year capital plans which will keep customer bills low on an absolute basis and relative to other household staples in Michigan as depicted in the chart on the right-hand side of Slide 15. But we don\u2019t limit our efforts to cost reduction initiatives. Economic development, which is another key element of our self-funding strategy, has proven to be quite fruitful in our service territory largely due to the active nature of our plan. Over the past three years, we\u2019ve seen substantial increases in new load commitments in our electric service territory pressing in 2018 with over a 100 megawatts exceed as indicated in the bar chart on Slide 14. This year we\u2019re targeting another 100 megawatts and are on track to meet this objective. It is also worth noting that our electric service territory is supported by a diverse customer mix as shown on the right hand side of the slide. And you\u2019ll note that the auto industry represents about 2% of our customer rate mix, which we use as a proxy for margin. Although the strike at GM is top of mind, is worth reminding you that we\u2019re not overly exposed to auto manufacturers or their suppliers in our electric service territory. However, we are watching closely for any spillover effects that can impact our residential and commercial customers. At the moment, we\u2019re not seeing any notable pullback in key economic indicators. In fact, unemployment in Grand Rapids, the heart of our electric service territory remains well below the national average, and we continue to see robust new construction activity in Western Michigan. We feel the diversity of our service territory is key to minimizing some of the earnings and operating cash flow often associated with weakening economic conditions. Slide 15 highlights the impact of such sensitivities among others on an annual basis, which most have been mitigated in 2019 given our recent gas order, the accelerated execution of our financing plan, any aforementioned risk mitigation activities which you\u2019ve reduced the probability of large variances in our plan. Rest assured, we\u2019ll continue to monitor these sensitivities as we come down the stretch in 2019, we\u2019ll manage the risk accordingly as we do year-in and year-out. And with that, I\u2019ll pass it back to Patti for some concluding remarks before Q&A. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Rejji. Our investment thesis is compelling and we\u2019ll serve our customers, our planet, and our investors for years to come. And with that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you very much, Patti. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Andrew Weisel : Hey, good morning, everybody. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Andrew. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : My first question is, you talked about the future long-term annual growth of 6% to 8%, obviously nothing new there. But is that meant to be apples to apples with the 10-year CapEx plan? In other words, does that mean to go through 2028? Patti Poppe : We don\u2019t give 10-year guidance. We do that on an annual basis and give you a good window looking forward in the near-term. But the 10-year capital plan certainly supports directionally 6% to 8%. And so that\u2019s really part of what we\u2019re trying to share today, that we\u2019ve got not just kind of a holding number, but an actual plan for capital investments across the system that will \u2013 should lead to our continued performance. Andrew Weisel : Okay, got it. Next question is in the list of potential sources of upside on Page 5, you don\u2019t include renewables there. Is that more a function of demand forecast and not seeing a need? Or is it related to customer bills and affordability? Or is there some other factor there? Patti Poppe : Well, it\u2019s in the base plan. So we know based on our IRP what our 20-year renewable strategy is. We know that we\u2019ll own half and purchase half of the new solar 6,000 megawatts in the 20 years, 5,000 megawatts in the 10 years. So that\u2019s built into the base plan. Rejji Hayes : And Andrew, it\u2019s also worth reminding that as we\u2019ve said in our IRP filing, it\u2019s going to be about 68 gigawatts per estimate of solar over the next sort of decade plus and we\u2019ll own half of that. And so that $4 billion you\u2019re seeing attributable through renewables over the 10-year period is a combination of the wind investments we\u2019re making for the IRPs, as well as the assumption of owning about half of that solar investment opportunity over the next several years. Andrew Weisel : It makes sense. Then one last one, this is going to be a little bit of a curve ball question. I noticed you posted a slide that called retail outreach a few weeks ago. Can you please talk about what drove that and maybe what you\u2019re trying to accomplish? And then round numbers, what percent of your stock is currently held by retail investors? Rejji Hayes : Yes. So that was a part of an effort that we did with one of your competitors, Andrew, in the interest of full disclosure. But in essence retail holdings are quite small relative to other utilities. I would say we\u2019re about 90-10 versus about 70 to 30 for the sector, institutional versus retail. And the large reason why that is, is as you may recall quite some time ago we suspended our dividend as we were pulling back from sins of the past. And so that really turned over our ownership to skew much more heavily towards the institutional side. And so over time as the fundamentals of the business have improved, we\u2019ve started to increase our exposure to retail investors and we\u2019ll look to do that more going forward. Andrew Weisel : Very good. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Constantine Lednev : Hi. Good morning, guys, it\u2019s actually Constantine here for Shar. Patti Poppe : Hey, Constantine. Constantine Lednev : Hey, guys, good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter and meeting all the estimates. So one quick question on the legislature. There was a set of bills that powering Michigan forward that was introduced, and that\u2019s kind of looking at kind of redoing I guess some of the things that were outlined in 2016. Just wanted to get your insight on kind of how does that impact your current IRP and potentially kind of any future IRP planning processes? Patti Poppe : Well, so there\u2019s a couple of good things to know that. Number one, our energy law that we did pass in 2016 was solid, and it created a framework that led to the IRP. The IRP gives three-year forward look for approval. So we have a three-year approval on the elements of the integrated resource plan and our renewable plans in particular. And it was so well received that we think some of these smaller proposals that are part of that package really aren\u2019t necessary because we\u2019ve created this framework for competitive bidding for solar. I think some of the proposals that are on the table are trying to do an end around and they\u2019re not getting much traction. So the good news is the energy law was \u2013 had a wide bipartisan support, our integrated resource plan had a wide spectrum of supporters from the Sierra Club to our largest business customers. So there\u2019s pretty good alignment with the committee leadership in the house and the Senate that we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve done our work on the legislation on renewables and the energy law that was completed in 2016. Constantine Lednev : Perfect. That definitely helps out. One kind of small housekeeping item, you started presenting kind of the upside and capital case with this presentation. Just curious, kind of how does that contemplate the long-term kind of equity needs for the business? You mentioned the $150 million per year. There\u2019s \u2013 does some of these opportunities kind of give a little bit of variability for the $150 million number? Rejji Hayes : Yes. So what I would suggest, Constantine, is that, we always provide our estimate for equity needs on a rolling annual basis with the update of our five-year plan in Q1 of every year. And so we\u2019ll provide any revised thinking around that at least over five-year period in Q1 of next year. But I think there are a lot of variables that go into that math and that\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult for us to give you a sort of a direct number at this moment. So think about the timing of one will be a federal tax payer, that\u2019s a big variable. Obviously, regulatory outcomes over time that will dictate the cost of capital, run rate, CapEx, et cetera, and then customer bill affordability and where that is relative to inflation. So all of those variables will impact our needs from an equity issuance perspective. Like I\u2019d say, direction, my senses will probably be up a little bit, but we\u2019ll see as we continue to flush out our operating plan, our financial plan over the next several years. Constantine Lednev : Okay, that makes sense. Thanks. I\u2019ll come back in queue. Rejji Hayes : Thanks. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Constantine. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hi, guys. Patti Poppe : Good morning. Michael Weinstein : Good morning. Just following up on the last question. Just noticing on the cash flow Slide 23 that your NOLs are increasing over the five-year period and cash flow is up. Is that because \u2013 the NOLs, are those increasing or the credits increasing because of the, I guess, higher number or higher amount of renewables in the system? Is that what\u2019s driving that? Rejji Hayes : Hey, Michael, it\u2019s more the latter. So we don\u2019t see a real increase in the NOLs. And in fact, they were \u2013 the NOLs themselves were re-measured upon tax reform going into effect when the bill was enacted in the late 2017. But we do see some accretion in the credits that we have because of the renewable investments we\u2019ve been making, both for the RPS. And over time we may see a little bit more increase in credits as well as we take on solar investments. So there\u2019s more to do with the renewable efforts than any accretion in NOLs. Michael Weinstein : And does that accrue to the benefit more as a customer or I mean, does this offset equity needs going forward? Just curious. Rejji Hayes : I would say based on what\u2019s on the page, it\u2019s more the latter, it offsets equity needs. But keep in mind, just based on the way in which we\u2019ve structured the RFPs for the sole investments, we\u2019ll actually see, because we\u2019re doing build and transfers as well as competitively bid out PPAs for the 6 gigawatts over time, we\u2019ll see the benefits of tax credits incorporated into the cost we have to pay for the investments as well as the contracts we\u2019ll take on and that will directly benefit the customers. So you\u2019ll see it benefit for both sort of a cash flow capital raising needs as well as customer benefits. Michael Weinstein : Okay, great. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Greg. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon : So \u2013 if my memory serves me correctly, the integrated resource plan, the $25 billion in capital, there\u2019s no capital in there for any additional fossil fuel generation, correct? Patti Poppe : Correct. Greg Gordon : So, on the margin, all your investment in power generation will be renewables. And as I also recall, I think I asked you this on the last quarterly call, battery storage is not a significant portion of that because you have such a big position in Ludington. Patti Poppe : Yes. A couple of things, in the future plan, we will obviously be maintaining our current fossil plan. So we\u2019ll still have gas plants. Our two gas plants will still be on the system up through 2040. They don\u2019t have ongoing capital maintenance plans. Campbell 3 will be in operation until 2039 and that has obvious ongoing capital plan. So there\u2019s capital associated with fossil, just no new fossil generation plants as we described. The other point on battery storage, Greg, I think it\u2019s really interesting our first IRP that we filed had 450 megawatts of storage in the latter part of the plan. But as we\u2019re preparing to file again as we\u2019ll re-file our IRP every three to five years, we\u2019re filing again here in 2021, we\u2019ll file another IRP, we\u2019re seeing that storage prices are dropping enough that we\u2019ll probably see more storage and the mix in our next IRP, which I think is exciting. When you combine the amount of solar and wind that we\u2019ll have on our system, it\u2019s going to be very beneficial to have cost-effective solar both from people talk about storage as a means of dispatching those renewables, but think about all those distributed solar panels. They\u2019re going to need voltage control, and so we\u2019re going to need storage associated with those just specifically for grid stability and reliability, not just for dispatchability. So I do see that more and more storage will be part of our plan, especially as our price drops. And that\u2019s all captured, those additional storage dollars will be captured in the electric ops portion of the CapEx plan. Greg Gordon : Fantastic. When you look at the amount of money that you plan on spending in the gas utility, when you think about the migration away from fossil fuels, I mean, are we seeing \u2013 it\u2019s sort of \u2013 there\u2019s some dissonance a little bit, right? I mean, you\u2019re seeing cities like Los Angeles and other cities out in Los \u2013 in California has started to move to actually try to eliminate incremental use of natural gas for any type of infrastructure. So as you look at your 10-year plan and you talked to the policy makers in Michigan, are you \u2013 is there a potential for a similar trend in gas infrastructure over time? Patti Poppe : Well, I would say this. Natural gas has been a big part of Michigan\u2019s heating seasons. I think these \u2013 a lot of the cities that you\u2019re seeing with moratoriums on natural gas don\u2019t have natural gas penetration for home heating and water heating like Michigan does. And so given that when we\u2019re looking at the cost comparison for electrifying all the home heating needs, the cost to customers would be significant. And so, given that cost impact, we don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a big market push or demand from customers to make that switch to electrification. So in our gas planning, we assume that our \u2013 we have modest assumptions about growth, we have more assumptions just about replacing like for like systems, making sure our systems are safe, making sure that that aging infrastructure can deliver the volume of natural gas that we move today on the coldest winter day. So that\u2019s really how we see the role of natural gas. I will also say though that to your point about the pressure from environmental community in general on gas, it is in what\u2019s in the spirit of our methane net zero plan for 2030 and why we were excited to announce that today. We can see the use of RNG in the natural gas system to minimize the kind of emissions and help to mitigate the environmental pressures. Our triple bottom line doesn\u2019t just apply to the electric side of the business. It applies to the gas part of the business too. Greg Gordon : Thanks, Patti. Have a great day. Patti Poppe : Yes, thanks, Greg. Operator : And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Rejji Hayes : Good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, howdy. So perhaps just to go back, if I can rehash a little bit of the 5-year versus 10-year update here, seems like the five-year piece is pretty hit there with the renewable piece. The three quarters is equal to the $600 million in the RFP. Just not to be pedantic about it, but it seems like it\u2019s the same. And then separately, can you give us a little bit more about the 25 to the 29 delta that you talk about in the upside opportunities? What would drive those if you \u2013 if that might be the best way to ask it? Patti Poppe : Yes. So first on your first question\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: What are those? Patti Poppe : Yes. The five-year plan is exactly as you\u2019ve described, the incremental capital is for the renewables associated with the IRP, which we had indicated we would add when we had approval. And then \u2013 and the 10-year plan, those upsides, we\u2019ve said it over and over again, there\u2019s so much work to be done on this system. We are trying to make sure that all factors are considered before we build out that capital plan. And that\u2019s what, I mean, I think some people, you could argue it\u2019s easy to throw a number out on a 10-year capital plan. I want you to understand that our capital plan that we are presenting today is a real plan. We actually have a 10-year gas plan drawn up that shows the needs for the system and what year we would do what. And so the basis for this capital plan effect is affected by our ability to complete the work, our balance sheet capacity and customer affordability. That 10-year plan, the $25 billion as described affects customers\u2019 bills by about 2.2% over per year. We\u2019re going to be looking for additional improvements and when we find additional headroom that can fund additional capital debts, what will be the trigger to add these additional capital investments. But all three of those factors matter a lot. And so we\u2019re always optimizing around them. Does that help? Is that what you\u2019re asking? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Well, maybe if I can push a little bit further, I suppose the electric reliability or gas description, is that triggered by, maybe to go back to Greg\u2019s question a little bit more, is that triggered by a customer side of the equation or is it just generally, again, the ability to have a customer headroom that continue to push forward on just broadly upgrading the company? Patti Poppe : I\u2019d say headroom is our biggest constraint, customer affordability, of course, balance sheet and ability to fund that plan is important to us too. We \u2013 look, the needs of the system far exceed our customer\u2019s ability to pay. And so we are constantly looking for ways that we can do more for less. So we apply the CE Way to our capital work as well as our O&M work and try and get lower our unit costs or more volume of work can be done. We\u2019re also looking obviously at workforce constraints and making sure that we\u2019ve got adequate people plans to do all this work. So there\u2019s a variety of factors that that mitigate adding in the additional capital, but trust me, the needs of the system demands those dollars and so we\u2019re constantly working for ways to get those included in the plan. Fortunately, we have time window to get that done. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, indeed. All right, good luck. See you soon. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And our next question today comes from Stephen Byrne of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrne : Good morning, and congrats on the JD Power results. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Stephen. Rejji Hayes : Thanks, Stephen. Stephen Byrne : Most of my questions have been addressed. I just wanted to go back to the upside opportunities that you\u2019ve laid out on Slide 5. In terms of just regulatory construct or other dynamics, I just want to make sure I\u2019m not missing anything incremental or sort of different that you would need from a regulatory perspective. In your remarks, Patti, you mentioned, it\u2019s really just dependent on rate case approvals, but was there anything else in terms of from a regulatory or design point of view, from a regulatory point of view that you would \u2013 that you would need to achieve? Patti Poppe : No, I mean, I think we have to remain aligned with our commission and the staff. They have a job to do. Their job is to make sure that we are prudently investing in the system to provide the service that customers expect. Now, hopefully it helps them do their job when we are \u2013 when our customers are satisfied with our performance as indicated in the JD Power results. We\u2019ve got the lowest complaints to the Public Service Commission ever. As a result of many of the improvements we made on the system. We try and make it easy for the Commission to say yes, but they really have \u2013 they\u2019re important check and balance in the process to make sure that the dollars that we are investing in this system are invested prudently and that they are in the best interest of customers. And I think in our most recent gas case, we got a good indicator from the Commission that they agree with our plan. They agree with the amount of infrastructure that we\u2019re putting on the system and they agree the importance of keeping certainly our gas systems safe and reliable and our electric system to be modernized and reducing our carbon emissions and increasing reliability for customers every day. So it is a partnership with the Commission to make sure that we\u2019re doing everything we can do in these capital investments. And so that takes annual rate proceedings as we file and we get a routine feedback from the commission about our plans. Rejji Hayes : So Steven, the one thing I would add is that, needless to say, we plan conservatively and so we presuppose the existing rate construct. But needless to say, if we could get more traction on tractors, investment recovery mechanisms and vehicles like that. It could certainly increase the likelihood that we could take on more of these upside opportunities. So clearly we\u2019ll continue that dialogue with the commission and staff over time. Stephen Byrne : That all makes sense. And then just shifting over to renewables, we discussed the IRP and just generally a plan. I want it to just drill in a little bit more on regulatory approval to rate base half of the investments. Could you just remind us sort of where we stand from a regulatory approval process in terms of just solidifying that capability over many years to come? Patti Poppe : Yes. So again, we \u2013 the IRP has a three year forward-looking formal approval, but the settlement that we had signed with all those parties that the commission approved really gave a good indication of the construct for making determinations for new additional capacity, specifically renewables. So the 50-50 ownership construct was agreed to buy a wide group of parties, which to me gives indication that will likely continue over time. However, as we file the each IRP, obviously there\u2019ll be discussion about extending that framework. What our fundamental belief is, that having competitively bid solar on an annual RFP, we set the lowest cost possible for our customers for new renewables. That creates, in some cases where the ownership lies with someone else. And we earn our financial compensation mechanism on top of that PPA. We still then create headroom for investments in the distribution system, which I believe in the long run is where our greatest demand for capital is going to be. Modernizing our electric distribution system is going to be the cause of the next decade. Both just replacing poles and conductor to new resiliency standards, but also modernizing and making that grid so much smarter to handle distributed resources and demand management tools. So I would suggest that the construct is in place so will be re-reviewed. Obviously every time we do a new IRP filing. Stephen Byrne : That makes sense. Thanks so much. Rejji Hayes : Yes. You\u2019re welcome. Thanks, Stephen. See you soon. Operator : And our next question today comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller : Good morning. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Travis. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Travis. Travis Miller : Wondering just real quick on the 2020 EPS. It looks like you\u2019ve got a lot of the regulatory uncertainty locked in or at least not there anymore for the year. What are some of the sensitivities there? Is it weather and O&M typical like that? Or is there something else in the regulatory wise? Rejji Hayes : Yes, I would say it was a fairly straightforward glide path for 2020 EPS, Travis. I think you highlighted the key driver, which will be rate relief, net of investments. And so if you think about the gas rate order we just received, about two-thirds of that will flow into 2020. And so if you just think about the math to that, there\u2019s about a $100 million of revenue increase that flows into 2020, and the tax effect that and we\u2019ve been doing all that puts and takes on investment-related cost. You ended with about net $0.14 or so, and that basically gets your right to the low end of guidance for next year. And so then you and puts and takes, we always assume normal weather and there will be variability we can count on that, good or bad and so we\u2019ll see where we\u2019ll end up. But I think that coupled with the usual contribution of the nonutility businesses should lead us to get to our 2020 EPS guidance range, without a lot of, I\u2019ll say additional items that are unforeseen. Travis Miller : Okay, great. Yes. And then question on that Slide 20, where you have the five-year CapEx line, that new renewables line, that\u2019s just incremental, right? So there\u2019s still some renewables in the electric utility spending. Is that the correct way to read that? Rejji Hayes : No. So that line item, new renewables, that\u2019s a combination of the renewable spend to get to the 15% RPS by 2021. So you\u2019ve got the wind investments in there and then it starts to take on in the latter portion of that five -year period, some of the solar related investments to the IRP. So that is all the utility \u2013 that is all the renewable-related spend that the utility in that line item there. Just over this five-year period from 2019 to 2023. Travis Miller : Okay. Okay. And that stuff would be in the rate base? Rejji Hayes : Correct. Travis Miller : Okay. And just real quick on the solar that you guys are talking about, six to eight gigawatts and the potential for growth there, what\u2019s your kind of split there between utility scale and distributed generation. Is that all utility scale or how do you see that potentially evolving between distributed generation or top solar and utility scale? Patti Poppe : Yes. We think the economics of utility scale are in the best interest of all customers. Now we do have residential programs that are run by the utility. They\u2019re like community solar sorts of programs so if utility scale that a customer can buy a plot if he will. There will be some residential distributed solar that customers want to invest themselves in private power generation. And so we have a program within the state to allow that to happen. But our plan is built around utility scale because we know that\u2019s the best price and most cost effective means of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Travis Miller : Okay, great. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquari. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I really have only one bigger picture question. So do you have any near term plans what to do with the bank and DIG? I mean, Rejji, you mentioned that there could be some slight uptick in your equity needs? Would you look at these assets as a way to maybe fulfill those equity needs? Patti Poppe : Yes. We have no news on EnerBank. There\u2019s nothing has changed as we\u2019ve said for the last several years. There\u2019s no change for EnerBank. It plays a particular role in our plan and continues to do. Rejji Hayes : Angie, I would just say for the enterprise because you asked about DIG. We continue to do that business. It\u2019s heavily contracted not just DIG but all the other assets we have there. And it\u2019s a fairly de-risked business. And so we continue to count on it on our five-year plan to give us a pretty steady stream of earnings in cash flow contribution next four or five years so we don\u2019t anticipate any dispositions there either. Patti Poppe : We\u2019ve done a couple small projects as you may be aware of enterprises for renewables, very customer driven, opportunistic for example, 100 plus megawatt wind farm for General Motors in Ohio. We have often customers come to us and say, can you help me make my renewable targets? And so in those cases, enterprises can play that role as well, both in Michigan and out of Michigan. Angie Storozynski : Very good. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Great. Thanks, Angie. Operator : And our next question today comes from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Fishman : Hi, good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning, David. Rejji Hayes : Hey, David. David Fishman : Good morning. I just had a quick question on \u2013 just the detail maybe we\u2019ll be getting in the future on the 10-year plan. Back in 2017, at the Investor Day, you kind of outline a little more detail around the gas infrastructure, electric distribution and plan investments. Is that something that we can expect maybe over the next 12-months or so or maybe following a little bit more detail on the gas side once you have the infrastructure investment plan there filed? Rejji Hayes : Yes. So I would say that, this level of detail which we actually think for a capital investment program, looking at 10 years is quite good. We don\u2019t intend to provide a great deal more granularity. But you can look for is that we will make some regulatory filings, I\u2019ll say in the coming months that do give pretty explicit guidelines around types of investment we\u2019ll make both in our gas business and over time our electric distribution business. And that\u2019s where you\u2019ll get the additional detail. And so, currently the $25 billion, the split between the utility, electric and gas as well as the renewable investments and then specifics around, again, a 10-year glide path for capital investments for gas. Again, all of that will be provided to our regulators over time through voluntary filings. And so you\u2019ll get more details there, but we don\u2019t intend to provide nearly the same level of granularity on this 10-year program as we have on an annual basis in our five-year programs. And so I think as you look at the updates on an annual basis in our rolling five year plan, you\u2019ll get more color on the outer years of this 10-year plan over time. Does that make sense, David? David Fishman : Yes, that does make sense. Thanks, Rejji. And I think earlier, you\u2019re asking a question or you\u2019re answering a question and you mentioned upside from trackers as one of the potential outcomes there. I know this has been talking about a 2020 outcome, but longer term along with more detailed filings that you\u2019re putting out is the expectation kind of file along with the IRP, there\u2019s opportunities there for incremental trackers? Rejji Hayes : Yes. We\u2019d like to think that any event we can get more traction on those types of mechanisms that would facilitate our ability to start to take on some more of those upside opportunities because then you really get to minimize the lag between cost and currency and cost recovery. But we\u2019ve clearly demonstrated that, we\u2019re going to make sure that we call before we walk in Michigan in that regard. And so with each filing we\u2019ll look at whether it makes sense to apply those types of mechanisms to various programs and if we think it\u2019s applicable and can get a good alignment with the commission and staff, we\u2019ll look to do more of that over time. But I think it\u2019s going to be a measured pace. Patti Poppe : Well. I\u2019ll just echo Rejji\u2019s point here, and say that our annual filing standard has worked pretty well for us. It actually allows us to be more adaptive to changing conditions around where our priorities around capital spend like vary from year-to-year. We do have forward-looking tests years, so we get good visibility and approval \u2013 preapproval for the capital that we spend. We do also benefit by passing our customers benefit by us being able to pass along annual savings that we realize to them in those annual rate cases. So we don\u2019t object to the annual rate case methods, but certainly IRMs in long-term plans that the commission has requested in gas and electric, and our IRP does give all of us a better ability to plan, have alignment, have better visibility, long-term work and investment, which is a basis for our 10-year capital plan. And then that allows for us to plan, obviously for the workforce that will complete all of that work. So what\u2019s really important is that we have good alignment with the commission on the work that needs to be done. And then the regulatory mechanisms can work pretty well for us. David Fishman : Great. Thanks. That makes lot of sense. Congratulations again, and congrats on the JD Power award. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Praful Mehta of Citi. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta : Hi guys, thanks so much. Rejji Hayes : Thanks, Praful. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Praful. Praful Mehta : Hi. So maybe first from storage. Actually, very interesting you mentioned the storage costs. If you could just give us a little bit more color on how you\u2019ve seen the storage costs come down and where it sits today. And secondly, what is the storage installation coming along with it? It\u2019s coming along with renewables on the utility scale side or DG or both. Some perspective on that will be very helpful? Patti Poppe : Yes, Praful. A couple of things. We did our IRP and we did the modeling, we modeled battery storage at about a $1,000 a kilowatt, over that by the latter part of the IRP when we would be installing the 450 megawatts. However, I\u2019ll tell you current costs are as high as $2,000 a kilowatt. So that\u2019s still pretty high and out of the market. Now the ITC when storage is combined with solar, that obviously gives you that 30% kicker, which is nice and helps make storage prices lower combined with a solar. And I\u2019ve heard some rumblings in Washington DC that maybe they would do a storage only ITC. I think there\u2019s a lot of interest and appetite. What I think is, going to be a bigger driver to the cost curves on storage are really the automakers commitment to emission free vehicles and the amount of R&D that is occurring and the dollars, the billions of dollars being spent by the automakers and consortiums and suppliers to them to crack the code on an electric vehicle or fuel cells. I think will bode well and provide benefits then to the electric industry to be able to utilize that storage technology in the R&D that\u2019s happening in that space. So I would expect that those prices will continue to drop. They\u2019re not in the market right now, but we\u2019re doing pilots and projects, so we can learn, so that we can be ready when that technology cost curve really starts to materialize. Praful Mehta : Got you. That\u2019s super helpful. And is that installation as you planned in the IRP more with the DG, utility-scale or both? Patti Poppe : Yes, mainly the utility-scale on the grid as a balancing resource. But I would suggest that our next IRP is going to have a different combination and we\u2019re not done with the modeling yet, but early indicators show that we\u2019ll have more distributed batteries as well as utility scale storage to make our renewables more dispatchable. Praful Mehta : Got you. Thanks. And then Rejji, just from, cash and equity perspective, I know you mentioned that the equity number could move a little bit. I just wanted to clarify what you meant by that $150 million moving a little bit, what\u2019s the final driver and what timeframe are you thinking about for that move? Rejji Hayes : Yes. If you look at the run rate capital investment we have now over our five-year plan, we\u2019re doing about $2.25 billion. And so that we think again, it can allow us to do that comfortably within our ATM program of about $150 million per year starting in 2020 through this five-year period. Now over time, as you think about the quantum of this 10-year plan, where we could be at a run rate of $2.5 billion, and if we start to dip into those upside opportunities, it could expand on an annual basis. And so it could go up directionally, but it\u2019s difficult to get more precise in that problem, because again, there are a number of factors that dictate your equity needs. And so when will be a federal cash tax payer? And so at the moment, we think 2024, but that could change, because we thought five years ago that would be a federal taxpayer down when we\u2019re not. And so that\u2019s a big variable, regulatory outcomes is clearly a big variable. And then customer affordability and our trends there relative to inflation. And so all those variables will impact the amount of equity we need to issue per year. And so absent that visibility, it\u2019s tough to say how much more it will go up. But again, we\u2019ll obviously manage the balance sheet prudently as we have over time and we\u2019ll see, where the equity needs end up. But I don\u2019t think materially, you\u2019ll see a big rise in the sort of next couple of years if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. Praful Mehta : Yes. That\u2019s exactly what I was going. All right. That\u2019s super helpful. Really appreciate it guys and congrats again. Thanks. Rejji Hayes : Thanks. Patti Poppe : Thanks. Operator : And then our next question from Sophie Karp of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Sophie Karp : Hi, good morning. Rejji Hayes : Good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning. Sophie Karp : Thank you for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. So, my first question is you had that really strong quarter and you maintained your guidance, I guess. Is there anything specific that I\u2019m giving you guys some caution maybe in Q4 as it evolves or has it just been conservative? Patti Poppe : Yes. We feel good about our year-end guidance has indicated bias to the midpoint as we have consistently said. And like every year, every quarter, there are changes that come at us and we \u2013 we pull back the curtain here and share a little bit on these calls about the kinds of things that we\u2019re managing the ups and downs, the goods with the bads, but we are on plan. We feel good about that plan and we ride that roller coaster and we enjoy it. We enjoy riding the roller coaster, so that you don\u2019t have to. We want to deliver that nice green line that Rejji mentioned in his prepared remarks that is our promise and that\u2019s what we continue to work to do every day. And that\u2019s what is so much fun about running this business is that we get to manage all those ups and downs and we feel real good about the plan and where we are for the rest of the year. Sophie Karp : Great. And then maybe, a bigger picture question. You show on your slides that the customer bills decline and will stay in that maybe relatively flat versus the inflation over the long-term. And I guess if we look back, a lot of that has come from a lower commodity price and then the low interest rates and things like that, right. And so as you move in your fuel mix and your incremental generation is mostly renewables to where that\u2019s no longer going to be the case. How do you expect, I guess is it going to be a challenge to manage its customer bill with this new and evolving generation mix? Patti Poppe : No. in fact, it\u2019s definitely in line with creating the headroom necessary, the replacement of fuel \u2013 the elimination of fuel expense is a huge benefit. And keep in mind; we\u2019re particularly and uniquely positioned, because of these large PPAs, on which we do not earn. We\u2019re going to be transitioning away from those PPAs, which are out of the market today. So, our customers are paying a high price for them. We\u2019re going to transition to renewable energies with no fuel costs and more competitive pricing on which we earn. And so it\u2019s the best combination for our commitment to the triple bottom line. We\u2019re excited about where the future takes us on all of that. It\u2019s directionally aligned with all of the savings we\u2019ve achieved to date. Sophie Karp : Thank you. Patti Poppe : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Patti Poppe for any closing remarks. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Rocco. Thank you everyone for joining us on the call today and we look forward to seeing many of you at EEI. We\u2019ll be able to go into more detail on the capital plan and we look forward to sharing more stories about all of the exciting things happening at CMS Energy. See you soon. Operator : Thank you, ma\u2019am. This concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy\u2019s website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 PM Eastern Time running through February 6th. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy\u2019s website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sri Maddipati : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Patti. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Sri. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on our year-end earnings call. This morning I\u2019ll share our financial results for 2019 and our 2020 outlook. I'll discuss the roll forward of our five year capital plan and provide an update on key regulatory matters. Rejji will add more details on our financial results as well as the look ahead to 2020 and beyond. And of course, we look forward to the Q&A. For 2019 I'm excited to report adjusted earnings of $2.49 per share. We were able to achieve another year of adjusted 7% EPS growth despite record storms and a variety of headwinds throughout the year. Thanks to our unique operational capabilities that enabled us to adapt to changing conditions by managing the work and driving out costs through our lean operating system to CE Way. With 2019 results in the books we're raising the lower end of our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance from $2.63 to $2.64, giving us a range of $2.64 to $2.68 with a bias to the midpoint, which is up 6% to 8% from the actual result we achieved in 2019. As we roll our plan forward one year, it reflects an additional $0.5 billion in our five year capital plan at the utility which supports our long term annual adjusted EPS and dividend growth of 6% to 8%. And is in line with our previously announced 10 year $25 billion customer investment plan. Well, there's been a lot of recent discussion around ESV [ph] it's a topic that is not new to us. Our continued success at CMS is driven by our commitment to deliver on the triple bottom line of people planet and profit. We don't trade one for the other. So while 2019 marked our 17th year of industry leading EPS growth, it was also a remarkable year for our commitment to people, our customers and coworkers and our planet. Our customers awarded us our highest JD Power customer satisfaction scores ever and named us number one in the Midwest residential gas. Those satisfied customers were served by a highly engaged and diverse workforce. Our accomplishments on the planet include reaching a settlement in our integrated resource plan, the announcement of our net zero methane emissions goal by 2030 for our gas delivery system, and restoring over 1500 acres of land in our home state. Our ability to meet our triple bottom line is underpinned by World Class performance. And we delivered our best ever customer on time delivery metric, eliminated more than $20 million of waste to the implementation of the CE Way, settled our electric rate case for only the second time in our history and received a gas rate case order that allows us to invest significantly in the safety and reliability of our large and aging gas system. Although 2019 has been another excellent year of solid performance and record achievements, we are still dissatisfied. We'll continue to keep improving as we work to deliver our financial and operational commitments year after year. Now every year you'll see the ups and downs that come our way as illustrated on slide six. And every year our unique capability of adapting to changing conditions enables us to deliver the results you expect year in and year out. In 2019, we were met with challenge after challenge of storm restoration costs, surpassed our full year budget to six months into the year. But we don't make excuses for storms or other weather related impacts on revenue. This is what I love about our model, where we ride the roller coaster for you so you can enjoy a smooth and predictable outcomes highlighted by the green line. This model has served our customers and you over the last decade plus and will continue to utilize it going forward. I feel compelled to give a shout out to the entire CMS Energy team for the tenacity and the agility they demonstrated in 2019. Given the headwinds we faced and challenges we overcame, I could not be more proud of the results, and thankful for the efforts of my coworkers. Like we do every year, we're celebrating on the run and moving on to our next set of priorities and setting new goals. With 2019 behind us and as we prepare to deliver in 2020, we'll continue to make progress on ensuring the safety of our gas system, driving customer satisfaction and delivering on our clean energy plan. The goals we set for ourselves in 2020 are ambitious. And as always, they're fueled by the continuing maturity of our lean operating system the CE Way. Our ability to execute on our capital plan, and make the investments our system need will depend on our ability to see and eliminate waste wherever it is. As we continue to mature in the CE Way we are creating a culture where our all of our coworkers are both motivated and able to fulfill our purpose; world class performance, delivering hometown service. These simple words mean a lot to us. Our system's capital demand that the utility continue to grow. And to that end, we're rolling our capital plan free cash flow and additional year, which will increase the spend over the next five years to about $12.25 billion and supports rate base growth of 7% over that period. This increase reflects a continued ramp up in annual capital investments in our electric and gas infrastructure to improve the safety and reliability of our systems, as well as increased investments in solar generation assets agreed to in our IRP, which was approved by the Commission last year. It's worth noting that only about 15% of these projects over the next five years are above $200 million. And about 75% of those projects are addressed in multiyear commission orders such as the IRP which mitigates risk and provides more certainty around execution and regulatory outcomes. We will also remind you that our five year customer investment plan is limited not by the needs of our system as that stretches vast and wide across the great state of Michigan, but instead by balance sheet constraints, workforce capacity and customer affordability. Looking now towards regulatory matters, with the 2016 energy law fully implemented, and with the benefits of tax reform address and recent Commission orders, our regulatory calendar for 2020 is much lighter than in recent years. Last year, we agreed to stay out of an electric rate case and the strategy served us well as we were able to capitalize on some of the cost performance efforts by leveraging the CE Way. Now we'll have the opportunity to funnel some of those cost savings back to our customers and offset some of the capital investment needs. Coupled with our efforts to ramp our energy efficiency savings to 2% by 2021, we will keep customers' bills affordable. We anticipate filing our next electric rate case by the end of this quarter. In December 2019, we filed a request in our gas rate case for $245 million of incremental revenue, including a 10.5% ROE, and an equity ratio of 52.5% relative to debt, as we continue to focus on the safety and reliability of our gas delivery system. This case builds on the order in our last gas case where nearly all the capital investments were approved, because you would expect the needs of our system haven't changed that much in just one year. In conjunction with our gas case we also filed our 10 year natural gas delivery plan, which provides a detailed look into the long term needs of our gas delivery system and supports our 10 year capital plan. We're thankful for the constructive regulatory environment in Michigan that allows for timely rate orders and forward planning and the Commission's commitment to working with us to continuously improve the safety and reliability of our system. I'll remind you regardless of changing conditions around us our triple bottom line and simple business model has served our customers and investors well and allows us to perform consistently year in and year out.  As highlighted on slide 10, our track record demonstrates our ability to deliver the consistent premium results you've come to expect year after year after year. And this year, you can expect the same. With that I'll turn the call over to Rejji. A - Rejji Hayes : Thank you Patti and good morning everyone. Before I get into the details, I'd like to share the wonderful news that Travis Uphaus from our IR team and his wife Marilyn welcomed their seventh child, Mark Christine Uphaus on Tuesday morning. So we are wishing me Uphaus family our very best from our headquarters in Jackson, Michigan. As Patti highlighted we're pleased to report our 2019 adjusted net income of $708 million or $2.49 per share up 7% year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS excludes select non-recurring items, including estimated severance and retention costs from our co-workers at our current coal facilities were just scheduled to be retired in 2023 as well as a recognition of an expense related to the potential settlement of legacy legal matters. 2019 results of the utility were largely driven by constructive outcomes in our electric rate case settlement in January 2019 and the gas rate order we received in September, which were partially offset by heavy storm activity, particularly in the first three quarters of the year. Our non-utility segment's raised [ph] guidance by $0.02 in aggregate, largely due to low cost financings at CMS Energy and solid performance from EnerBank. As we review our full suite of financial and customer portability targets for 2019 on slide 12, you'll note that in addition to achieving 7% annual adjusted EPS growth, we grew our dividend commensurately and generated approximately $1.8 billion of operating cash flow. Our steady cash flow generation and conservative financing strategy over the years continue to fortify our balance sheet, as evidenced by our strong FFO to debt ratio, which is approximately 17.5% at year-end and required no equity issuances in 2019. Lastly, in accordance with our self-funding model, we effectively met our customer affordability targets by keeping bills at or below inflation for both the gas and electric businesses, all while investing a record level of capital of approximately $2.3 billion at the utilities. Moving on to 2020, as Patti noted, we are raising our 2020 adjusted earnings guidance from $2.64 to $2.68 per share, which implies 6% to 8% annual growth off of our 2019 actuals. Unsurprisingly, we expect utility to drive vast majority of our consolidated financial performance with the usual steady contribution from the non-utility business segments. One item to note is that enterprises EPS guidance is slightly down from their 2019 results given the absence of a gain on the sale of collect assets in the second quarter 2019. All in we will continue to target the midpoint of our consolidated EPS growth range at yearend. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2020 EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on slide 14, we plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to an estimated $0.06, a negative year-over-year variance given the colder than normal weather experienced in 2019 in the benefit of our gas business. We anticipate the cost reduction initiatives, largely driven by the CE Way and other expected sources of year-over-year favorability, such as lower storm restoration expenses after an unprecedented level of storm activity last year, will fully offset the absence of favorable weather in 2019. It is also worth noting, that we capitalized on an opportunity to fully fund our defined benefit pension plan earlier this month, which provides additional non-operating cost savings and EPS risk mitigation. Moving on to rate relief, we anticipate approximately $0.17 of EPS pickup in 2020. As mentioned during our Q3 call about two-thirds of this pickup has already been approved by the Commission, and the gas rate order we received in September and the approval of our renewable energy plan, in the first quarter of 2019. We will expect a final order in our pending gas case in October of this year, which effectively makes up the balance of our expected rate relief driven EPS contribution in 2020. While we plan to file an electric case in Q1 of this year, the test year for that case will start in 2021. Lastly, we apply our usual conservative assumptions around sales, financings and other variables. As always, we will adapt to new conditions and circumstances throughout the year, to mitigate risk and increase the likelihood of meeting our financial and operational objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. As we work toward delivering our 2020 EPS target, we remain focused on cost reduction opportunities, within our entire $5.5 billion cost structure, the core components of which are illustrated on slide 15. For well over a decade, we have managed to achieve planned and unplanned cost savings to mitigate interior risk and create long-term headroom in our electric and gas bills to support our substantial customer investments at the utility. As we looked at 2020 and beyond, we continue to believe there are numerous cost reduction opportunities throughout our cost structure. These opportunities include but are not limited to the exploration of high price PPAs, the retirement of our coal fleet, capital enabled savings as we modernize our electric and gas distribution systems, and the continued maturation of our lean operating system the CE Way. These opportunities will provide sources of interior risk mitigation, as well as a sustainable funding strategy for our long-term customer investment plan, which will keep customers' bills low on an absolute basis, and relative to other household staples in Michigan as depicted in the chart on the right hand side of the page. Moving on to, weather normalized sales. As we've discussed in the past, economic conditions in Michigan remained positive, particularly in our electric service territory, which is anchored by Grand Rapids, one of the fastest growing cities in the country, as evidenced by the statistics on the upper left hand corner of slide 16. And when it comes to Michigan's economy, we are not passive participants. In fact, in addition to directly investing billions of dollars throughout the state annually, we collaborate with key stakeholders across the state to drive industrial activity through our economic development efforts. These efforts have attracted nearly 300 megawatts of new electric load in our service territory since 2016. And in 2019 alone, the contracts we signed will support over 3600 jobs, and bring in more than $1.5 billion of investment to Michigan. A prosperous Michigan, supported by our economic development efforts, offers multiple benefits to our business model. In the near term, it drives volumetric sales, which support our financial objectives and longer-term it creates headroom in customer bills by reducing our rates. As mentioned in the past, we also continue to see a positive spillover effect of Fed industrial activity on our higher margin, residential and commercial segments overtime in the form of steady customer count growth and favorable load trends. As you'll note in the chart on the right hand side of the slide, we've seen average residential load growth of 1% and 1.5% for the electric and gas businesses respectively, over the past five years when normalized for weather and our energy efficiency programs. To summarize our financial and customer affordability targets for 2020 and beyond, we expect another solid year of 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth, solid operating cash flow growth, exclusive of the aforementioned discretionary pension contribution, and customer prices at or below inflation. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment grade credit metrics. And as you'll note, our equity needs are approximately $250 million in 2022 due to the previously noted deferral of our equity issuance means in 2019. We expect our equity needs to be roughly $150 million per year in 2021. And beyond, which can be completed through our ATM equity issuance program, which will likely file along with our shelf during the first half of this year. Our model has served our stakeholders well in the past as customers received safe, reliable and clean electric and gas on affordable prices and our investors benefit from consistent industry leading financial performance. On slide 18, we have refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note with reasonable planning assumptions and robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. There will always be sources of volatility in this business, be they weather, fuel cost, regulatory outcomes or otherwise. And every year we view it as our mandate due to the warning for you and mitigate the risk accordingly. And with that, I'll hand it back to Patti for her concluding remarks before q&a. Patti Poppe : Thank you, Rejji. Our investment thesis is compelling and will serve our customers, our planet and our investors for years to come. And with that, Chad, would you please open the line for q&a? Operator : Certainly, thank you very much Patti. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator instructions] The First question will come from Greg Gordon was Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Hey, good morning Patti, Rejji. Patti Poppe : Morning, Greg. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon : Couple questions on the year. So did you -- Rejji, did you say that small asset sale gain from enterprises was in the second quarter? Is that correct? Rejji Hayes : Yes. That's right. Greg Gordon : Can you can you just give us a little more description of what asset it was and what you saw, the rational for that? Rejji Hayes : Absolutely. So enterprises specifically dig at some transmission related assets. The informal parlance and switchyard assets, which they sold to ITC transmission in the second quarter. And so we booked again at roughly $16 million or $0.04 in Q2. That was part of our plan throughout the year, which is why you'll see sort of an aberrant trend between our '19 actuals and what we anticipate for 2020. Greg Gordon : Understood, it may be wrong, but I think you're breaking interbank out separately now, for the first time. I'm happy to get the incremental disclosure. But can you just give us the rationale for that? And then I have one more question. Rejji Hayes : Yeah, happy to. EnerBank this year, and they had a wonderful year as Patti noted, they hit about $2.6 billion, a little over $2.6 billion in assets, which is in excess of 10% of our consolidated asset rational. And so we chose to report out this segment at this point. Greg Gordon : Great. My final question is on the decision to fund the pension, how much did -- how much sort of dollars did you top off the pension? And can we think about the financial benefit of that being sort of the delta between the financing costs and the expected pension return? Rejji Hayes : Yeah. So starting with your last question first, yes, we did take into account and you should assume that the EPS related pickup is net of the funding costs. And so we anticipate about $0.05 earnings per share upside attributable to that. The amount and you'll see this in the appendix is a little over $530 million. And so that allowed us to fully fund our inactive defined benefit plan. Greg Gordon : And that was funded from a parent infusion or from off of the actual operating company, balance sheet? Rejji Hayes : The latter. So we did a term loan in the interim at Consumers Energy. And it's interesting, the term loan funding of that was about $300 million. We actually had a little bit of excess cash flow that allowed us to fund it with a bit of excess cash, which also helped the EPS accretion attributable to that. Greg Gordon : Okay, thank you all very much. Have a great morning. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Greg. Patti Poppe : Thank you, Greg. Operator : The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning team. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Julien. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, perhaps just kicking off first, as usual, we're focused on the CapEx in the upward trend and nicely done on the upward of $0.5 billion increase here as you go forward. Can you talk a little bit about the upside trajectory? I suppose, if we take that $0.5 billion just kind of in the latest single year in isolation, going forward and you continue to do that, you end up somewhat in excess of your 10 year plan. So, obviously, we talked about the full but perhaps this might be an opportunity to elaborate a little bit. And then probably the second question was a time, DP had some pushback on their latest process on procurement in there R&D. Any reasons with respect to your ongoing efforts on the renewable side specifically? What are specific quests on it? Patti Poppe : Well, I'll take the first part, and I'll let Rejji take the second part, Julien. The capital plan, the $25 billion capital plan, does have fluctuations year-to-year some. And you'll see, we've got a five year look in the appendix of the deck, so you can see what the plan is by year. And we do have some opportunities in that $25 billion and we talked about that after the third quarter. You know, there's certainly demand for additional spend on electric reliability and grid modernization and our gas business. And as always, we're working to balance the competing demands for capital internally, having our internal capital battles, if you will, but also making sure that our bills remain affordable, making sure that the capacity to do the work is possible. So that, we have good credibility with our regulators that we do, what we said we're going to do. And so the upside that you see in this first five year forward adding additional year is the natural fluctuation, but it all supports the $25 billion plan and that supports our 6% to 8% growth trajectory. Rejji Hayes : Yeah, Julien, you also just asked about what could allow us to -- I think, if I heard you correctly, just dip into those upside opportunities in this, Patti and I have talked about in the past. Now the constraints are primarily, customer affordability. And so that is the primary constraint on whether they will be able to dip into those upside opportunities to $3 billion to $4 billion in that 10 year plan, as well as balance sheet constraints and potentially workforce capacity. And so, overtime as all of those potentially move favorably. We will consider recalibrating, but for now, that's where the plan sets. Now getting to your second question related to if I heard you correctly, again, the seed wasn't all that good, but it sounded like a potential reaction to I think the ALJs decision and DTEs integrated research. But needless to say, we're not going to speak for DTE on their regulatory filings. But if you're asking whether that has an impact on our IRP and the execution of IRP, the answer to that is no, we obviously just concluded the RFP. Well, first we got approval for our IRP in mid last year. And we just concluded in September or deepen the Q4. The request for proposal for the first launch of 300 megawatts of solar. This is part of a longer-term effort to really build out solar generating assets, to the tune of 6 gigawatts by 2040. And this first trance or call it 1.1 gigawatts that we're approving the settlement, we just did about 300 megawatts this year, we'll do another 300 megawatts, in RFP in September this year in the balance of 500 megawatts in 2021, half of which will be rate base, half of which will be PPA. And so we're in execution mode, and obviously, we'll look to file a new IRP in June of '21 for the settlement. So, that's where we stand on that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Excellent. I'll leave it there. And thank you all. Best of luck. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Julien. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hi, good morning guys. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Michael. Michael Weinstein : Hey. I just wanted to confirm that the extra $500 million of capital spending that's planned for the next five years is not part of the $3 billion to $4 billion of upside opportunities, right? Because the total 10 year plan didn't really change that much. Patti Poppe : That's right, Michael, you've got that right. This is just the one year roll forward. So it shows the modification in the plan. Michael Weinstein : Got it. So this a -- is it in acceleration of spending that you would have done in the second five years of that 10 year plan basically? Patti Poppe : No, it's right in line with our plan to add some additional, the IRP solar that was approved as well as some additional electric reliability. And really you can plan on fluctuation between the gas, the electric, the renewable parts of the spend as the years go forward, so that we can optimize that capital spend to the benefit of customers. And, again, as mitigating the challenges that Rejji articulated around affordability balance sheet. We're always just working the plan to have the highest value capital year after year. Michael Weinstein : Right. And also, I wanted to confirm that there's no incremental equity needs from any of that either doesn't -- obviously doesn't look like a plan change at all and equity. And that this is all -- it's all ATM and internal programs, right? There's no block equity. Rejji Hayes : Yeah. That's correct. Michael Weinstein : Okay. And one thing I would maybe you could talk a little bit more about is you discussed a little bit about the attraction of new commercial or industrial customers in your territory. And can you discuss the potential impact on electric load and on your industrial customers as electric vehicles gain traction across the supply chain for the auto industry? Patti Poppe : Yeah, I would say industrial loads that we are seeing being added actually ends up being very unrelated to automotive. Michigan is more and more diversified. We've had some big ag customer additions and some pharma additions. And so I would say if anything, we're seeing some diversification in Michigan and our makeup of our industrial rate base. But I would also say -- our industrial customer base. But I would also offer on the EV front that as the chair of the EEI electric transportation as the co-chair of that committee, I've had an opportunity to really get exposed to some of the national fleet operators. We had Amazon for example at our National EEI Meeting in January talking about their ambitions to electrify their fleet. I see that as a big opportunity. Load growth for electric per capital certainly has not had significant increases in fact it goes down in many cases as equipment gets more efficient, lighting gets more efficient. And I think that fleet potential to be actual load growth potential in the future as their ambitions materialize. Now I will tell you it's not going to sneak up on.  Because with their first of all, they need to have electric transportation at the fleet scale available, the actual vehicles, the trucks, et cetera. And that development cycle is not fast. But then we'll be working with them to cite their charging stations and make sure we maximize the benefit to the grid and minimize the addition to peak demand.  So I think it's a great opportunity, frankly for the industry. And Michigan will certainly be participants in that. Michael Weinstein : Super, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi guys, and congrats on a good quarter. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Praful. Rejji Hayes : Thank you Praful. Praful Mehta : So maybe first, a more big picture step back question. Utilities clearly have been doing well in the in the current stock price environment, and CMS clearly doing well do given the execution. Do you think there is any use of that currency from your perspective, M&A or otherwise that you think you can look at or execution is primarily the focus at this point? Rejji Hayes : Yeah, Praful. Our position on M&A versus organic growth has been consistent for some time. And we're fully focused on executing on our capital plan. We've got enough to do within our walls. And as I've said in the past, we're paying one times book to fund those capital investments, I'd rather do that and pay a premium for somebody else's CapEx backlog. So we're acutely focused on executing on our plan. Praful Mehta : Fair enough. Makes sense. Then, just quickly on the operating cash flow, then you're looking at the slide 17. And you say up 100 from the 2020's $1.7 billion. Just can you walk through that what's the increase that you're kind of seeing in the long term plan? And I guess connected to that I also saw increased NOL utilization on slide 23. So just try to understand a little bit of the drivers around the operating cash flow. Rejji Hayes : Yeah, so Praful as you may recall, prior to the enactment of tax reform at the end of 2017 we were on this very healthy trajectory of about $100 million of year-over-year or at least year versus prior year budget OCF accretion per year. And it has to do with just the very nice fundamentals of this business. I mean, we're investing capital, growing rate base, getting solid customer receipts. And I'll give full credit to our folks who manage working capital very well on our team as well. And so it's just a nice, healthy byproduct of all that good work there. And so the only reason we paused slightly was just due to tax reform and the cash flow degradation effects of that. So we basically took a two year pause on that level of growth. And so we guided in 2018 at $1.65 billion we managed to exceed that.  And again, we guided in 2019 a $1.65 billion and managed to exceed that again. And so now we feel like again, relative to what we budgeted, the prior year will be back on that sort of $100 million per year increase starting this year in 2020.  And so that's what we have in the forecast and we feel very good about that, particularly given the magnitude of the capital investment plan, our ability to manage our costs, and again, just execute well in the working capital front. And so we feel like we have a very nice glide path to continue on that trajectory. Now, as it pertains to NOLs and credits, we obviously had a significant remeasurement going back to tax reform on our NOLs, we still think we've got a little bit of utilization left on what's remaining. But then also, we still have quite a few business credits that we've accumulated overtime and we expect modest accretion of that, just given some of our efforts in the renewable side. And so that's where you see still decent amount of also a combination of NOLs and tax credits. And so at this point, we don't expect to be, a federal tax payer until call it 2024. There's a modest amount that we will pay in 2023, based on our forecast, but really not a partial taxpayer to 2024. Is that helpful? Praful Mehta : Yeah, that's super helpful. Thanks for that. And then just finally, in terms of storm impacts and storm costs, is there any in the current rate case filing, is there any plan to change what gets recovered or what is allowed to be recovered in terms of storm costs? Patti Poppe : Yeah, in our next electric rate case, certainly we want to reflect the average service restoration expenses. And what we've been recovering in rates is less than what we've actually experienced on the last five year average. And so we want that to be reflected. But we also want and believe that with the age of the system that our increased spend in both the fundamental reliability of the system, we've been increasing both the actual spend as well as the requested spend, we think there's a lot of justification for that to keep up with the age of the system.  And so we'll continue to ramp the reliability spend. But we also want accurate reflection of the operating expenses associated with service restoration. And while frankly at the same time, we're working to reduce the cost of every interruption by making our processes more efficient, by making our utilizing technology to respond faster and at a lower cost. And so we're doing both simultaneously. Praful Mehta : Got it super powerful. Congrats again, guys. Patti Poppe : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Hey, good morning, guys. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Shar. Rejji Hayes : Good morning Shar. Shar Pourreza : Just on a couple questions. On your annual CapEx guide in your disclosures that's closer to the back of the slide deck. There's obviously some shuffling spend between 2020 and 2021, can you just remind us what actually drove this. And can you maybe talk a little bit more about the new CapEx you're introducing towards the back end, really more specifically on the mix between gas and electric? Rejji Hayes : Sure, Shar, happy to take that. So a little bit of the shift that you probably have noticed between what's we're expecting or what we were expecting in 2020 in our prior five year plan that we rolled out in Q1 of last year, instead of this five year plan, it has everything to do with just the timing of the rate case in the forward test years. And so this current vintage now that we're a year smarter reflects the magnitude of spend we expect in 2021. And that aligns nicely with the gas case that's pending, that we filed in December of last year, and with the electric case, we\u2019ll likely file in Q1 of this year. And so that's really what why you see that shifting between 2020 and 2021. And what we've always said and this remains true to form is that, the absolute amount for the quantum of capital we anticipate spending on a five year period one year period is, always pretty consistent. But the composition does change overtime and sometimes you get shifts in a year, and so that's effectively what you're seeing. And then for the outer years, I think Patti did a nice job summarizing this, is just, we're just basically losing 2019 from the prior vintage and rolling in another year. So going from a '19 to '23 plan to a '20 to '24 plan. And as part of that roll forward, you're seeing an expansion, more of the solar generation will do attributable to the IRP, so taking on that sort of final tranche of call it 250 megawatts that will rate base. And then you couple that with additional spend, in both our electric distribution, reliability related capital investments as well as gas infrastructure spend. And so those are kind of the pieces you're seeing in the back end of that five year period. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then some of the -- and then Patti just started to be a dead horse on this, but I just had a follow-up on that incremental capital opportunities, you guys have been highlighting. It seems like you're managing O&M well. You have built headroom that continues to improve the economic backdrop remain strong in your service stories. You kind of highlight, you do have sort of balance sheet capacity. So I'm kind of curious is what are the drivers that we are missing as far as you look to pull forward some of that spend. Is there anything else outside of just managing towards that 7% growth target, that midpoint? Is it a function of trying to find the optimal capital projects internally? So what's sort of the offsets those drivers, because it seems like the drivers seem to fit towards you accelerating spend versus not. Patti Poppe : You know, one thing I'll tell you about our 10 year capital plan, you know, I think some people might argue that it's impossible to have a 10 year capital plan because conditions change so much or you don't know enough about the future. I can tell you our 10 year capital plan has a significant amount of meat on the bones. And what we intend to do is make sure that we are able to execute the work that we have committed to. And so I'll tell you, the ramp up of capital requires a significant operational and ability to execute and prepare the workforce. And when we hear nationally about constraints on ability to attract talent and to build out a workforce, we have to attract the workforce to deliver all that work. And so that we want to make sure is well timed and well-planned so that we do precisely what we said we're going to do.  And it's also important that from an affordability standpoint that our customers are able to pay and would value for, value the investment that we'd be making on their behalf. So really customer affordability continues to be a front of mind. And, and as an operator myself, I want to make sure my team is ready and prepared to execute the work that we commit to. It's easy to write a number in a spreadsheet. It's not a thing to go dig the trench and lay the wire and roll the trucks. So we've got to make sure that we're ready all the way around. Shar Pourreza : Got it. So the human capital I expect is bit of a constraint. Okay, great. All right thanks so much guys. Congrats again. Patti Poppe : Thank you, Shar. Operator : Our next question will be from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning guys. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Jonathan. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : Thanks for taking my question. So I was going to ask you about the shift in the CapEx from '20 to '21, and I think you've addressed that. So thank you for that. Just one other issue. Now you're giving this breakout of enterprises, bank and the parents, which it sounds like you'll continue to do that going forward, given the size. But should we think Reggie, about the parent roughly consistent going forward with this number you're showing for 2020, or is that going to move around out in the five year plan? Rejji Hayes : Well, it should increase over time, Jonathan, because keep in mind, that's largely at this point, interest expense at the parent and you know, we have $12.2 billion of capital investments that we're going to be funding over this period. And so obviously we do the best we can in terms of getting low interest rates realized in our debt financings, but we just assume that the new money will be raising that that interest expense should come up over time or increase over time. And so we do expect that segment to increase. Every now and then we overachieve of course. Because Sri and his team has been very good at getting financings at lower rates than anticipated, but it conservatively, we'll assume that that segment does increase. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. So you can just basically financing of portion of the underlying growth. I think that's it. I already want to talk on the CapEx, so thank you. Patti Poppe : Thanks Jonathan. Operator : And the next question will be from Ali Agha with STRH. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha : First question you, Patti, can you just remind us again, as you are looking at the sales data, roughly how much on an annual basis does energy efficiency sort of takeaway from the sales numbers? Rejji Hayes : Yeah. So, and this has been, basically come out of the new, what I can call do so much but the 2016 energy law, Ali. And so we have a 1.5% year over year reduction target that we get economic incentives on. And so you take the prior year's load and then you reduced that by 1.5%. And we do that through all of the nice programs we have and rebates on led light bulbs and things of that nature. And so that's, we're historically, we've been for the last few years, our current five year plan, and we've been very public about this as part of our RRP is to expand those energy waste reduction programs. And so we're on a glide path to get to a 2% year-over-year reduction. And so that'll be about 2% of our prior year's low's and so I just want to reemphasize that we do get economic incentives on those programs. And so historically, that's been a run rate of call $34 million pretax combined electric and gas. And so as we glide path to that 2%, that amount of pretax income will crest at about $47 million for the latter years of this plan. And we anticipate about $41 million in 2020 alone as we glide path up. And so we anticipate again, 1.5% to 2% reduction in load as part of that, and remember, it also gets screwed up in the rates as we file new cases. And so that is also something worth noting. Ali Agha : Okay. And so just to be clear, if I look at the numbers for calendar '19, as reported weather normalize was negative 1.4. If we adjust that for and at your efficiency, then it should be done relatively flat. And I know you're sort of on an apples-to-apples basis looking at that being up 1%, I believe in '20 and perhaps beyond that. So can you just talk a little bit more about that dynamic, you had growth going up to 1% and beyond? Rejji Hayes : Happy to. And we actually tried to get in front of that question because it comes up quite a bit by offering this new slide 16 in the presentation. But you're thinking about it Ali the right way. And so if you look at that sort of blended, weather normalized, electric load for 2019 versus 2018 1.4% down think of that as flat.  I\u2019ll also note what's embedded in that 1.4% is a reduction in volume from a very large low margin customer. And so when you back out the effects of that large low margin customer, our weather normalized sales goes from 1.4% down to about 0.5% down. And then if you take out the effects, energy efficiency will now you're up 1%.  And you can look across all of our channels for electric and see that trend, which we think is the right way to think about it. So residential flat, so again you normalize for energy efficiency, you're up 1.5%, commercial down 1.1%, you normalize you\u2019re up 0.5%. And we have seen those organic trends in our customer accounts just to make sure that we're not being too scientific here.  And so we feel quite good about that. And think there is very healthy economic growth in our service territory, particularly with the high margin part of our supply chain, -- our customer segments. Ali Agha : Got you. And one last question. I know as you mentioned, that the 2016 energy law is fully implemented, et cetera. Anything of note in this year's legislative session for us to keep an eye on that maybe relevant to you folks or something that you guys are keeping an eye on as well? Patti Poppe : No, Ali, I would suggest, particularly here in Michigan, there's nothing really being driven by the elections this fall. Certainly the presidential election is going to be a big distraction. We do have our whole house, State House, of course has two year terms and our congressional districts have two year terms. And so there's reelection.  Our governor did her state of the state last night and she doubled down on her commitment to fix the damn roads here in Michigan. That's her slogan not mine. And so we're happy to support the investment and infrastructure. And, frankly, as we do more road repairs, it's a great opportunity for us to collaborate with our Department of Transportation and our construction work here in Michigan to do our investment infrastructure at a lower cost for all citizens.  So I would say nothing though new from a legislative agenda here in Michigan. Ali Agha : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller : Thank you. Good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Travis. Travis Miller : On the gas case. I wonder if you could layout some of the -- I don\u2019t use the word contentious, but some of the more debatable issues that you see coming up there, and in particular, the ROE and the decision to go with the higher request. Patti Poppe : Yeah. Well, a couple things, Travis. First of all, as I mentioned, we have this 10 year gas -- natural gas delivery plan that we filed with our case. And that plan has been well vetted with actually collaborated with our staff at the commission and its development and aligning on our priorities.  One thing I can firmly applaud our commission for is their commitment to being able to see long-term plan so they can make better decisions in a one year case. And so this 10 year gas plan we filed has a lot of meat on the bones. And I feel very good about it. You can look at our last case and see that over 90% approval of the capital that we requested is a good indicator that that work that we have committed to doing is the work that the commission would want us to do as well. So we feel good about that.  Now on the ROE, of course we feel justified in 10.5% ROE ask. And so we always make sure that we have adequate justification for that. It yields about a $25 million impact. If you take the 10.5 to 9.9. And so we recognize that the commission has a job to do. They've made it clear that they recognize that a healthy ROE is important to the utility. Low cost of capital is important for the benefit of customers and the utility. And so we look forward to seeing what the final outcome of that rate case would be. But what's more important, I think as we really take an eye on is the volume of capital and the alignment with the staff and the Commission on the work that we're doing. Travis Miller : Okay, great. You anticipated my question on ROE. So I want to ask that delta number. But broadly on the enterprise and EnerBank and especially enterprise. What's your three year strategy? Any updates to that here in the last quarter or two? Rejji Hayes : Yeah. So, the plan at enterprises has been pretty straightforward for some time. And so, obviously, a dig drives the vast majority of the financial performance of enterprises. And we really have tried to derisk that business on its future earnings potential quite a bit through the energy contracts that we amended and extended about a year or so ago. And then we've also walked in good deal of our capacity open margin over the next few years as well. And so we feel like this should be pretty steady, predictable performance at enterprises. I'll also note we've done a few of these contract of renewable opportunities now the last year and a half. And so, we will look to be opportunistic if those -- if we find nice opportunities with third parties where we can get attractive returns, credit worthy counterparties. And basically, I've described very little terminal value to projects like that. And so we'll look to do those from time to time. But again, we expect the three or four look to be pretty, pretty straightforward. Travis Miller : Okay, great. Any of those contracted renewables and the CapEx plan right now? Rejji Hayes : Not in the 12 that we highlighted. Travis Miller : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Patti Poppe : Thanks Travis. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Andrew Weisel : Good morning, everyone. Patti Poppe : Good morning Andrew. Andrew Weisel : I've got one near term and one long term. First on the near term, if you can elaborate. Rejji you gave a lot of good color on the demand trends by class. Are you able to estimate like how much of the impact particularly industrial is related to tariffs and trade wars? And then what are your assumptions for load growth embedded in the 2020 guidance? Rejji Hayes : Yeah, so we have, I'll say for 2020 guidance, we're fairly conservative in our position both in 2020. And also over the course of the five year plan. And so for electric and again, you got to keep it -- take into account that we have the energy efficiency programs embedded in that. We're assuming about, call it flat to slightly declining for electric. And so that is our working assumption for really 2020 and beyond. And it's a gas, flat to maybe slightly up based on the trends we're seeing there. And so that's our current position.  In terms of industrial activity clearly, we've talked in the past about the diversified nature of our industrial customers and our electric service territory. And I'll just remind that, folks at about 2% of our gross margin equivalent comes from the auto sector. And so yes, of course we do have exposure to companies that may have some level of exposure to export/import markets to trade war, whatever you want to call it. But, at the end of the day a lot of the margin we generate comes from our residential and commercial customers. And we continue to see very nice trends there.  And so, the industrial activity, we're obviously a very supportive of it through our economic development efforts. We do think it's important to Michigan and our efforts on the residential commercial side, but really the vast majority of our sales are driven by residential commercial margin there, and we've seen good trends. The only other data point I'll leave you with is that 1% change in our industrial estimated growth probably drives about a half a penny of EPS. And so there really isn't a significant impact when you see variation in the industrial class, because of this much lower margin. Andrew Weisel : Right. Makes sense. Okay, good. Next longer term question. You continue to point to the midpoint of the 6% to 8% range. And obviously you've been delivering 7% and that's probably not a surprise. My question is you show rate-based growth of 7% excluding the upside opportunities on CapEx. You have some incremental EPS growth from things like the energy efficiency and demand response incentives as well as the EnerBank growth. My question is, what would prevent you from hitting the high end of the range going forward? Is that equity dilution or any other factors? Patti Poppe : Well, I'd say number one, we're always balancing the ability for our customers to afford the products so that we have a sustainable plan. And I'll also offer, and you can see, from our track record on years when there has been some favorability on a year when we could have delivered more than the midpoint we reinvested in the business. And so one of the key components of our success here is our consistent performance that you actually can set your watch to, that you can rest at night. That's our goal. And so the idea that we would start to fluctuate in pursuit of a higher target really, is not consistent with our commitment to delivering as you would expect year after year after year. And actually so at, even at this stage of the year, we're thinking two years out, not just next year. And so we're always looking for ways to pull ahead expenses, re-invest favorability for the benefit of the consistency in the long run. Andrew Weisel : Sounds good. I'll speak in the last one. Patti, no story of the month, any quick one you can throw at us? Patti Poppe : Let's see. Layers many of them. Here's one just off the top of my head. We had a team at one of our service centers, really looking at their meter management process. And when we went out to talk to them, Garrick Rochow, our Head of Operations observed that this team had this problem of meter inventory and how they were managing that inventory. And because they have these teams called fix it now teams which are empowered work teams right on the ground level focused on driving the business. They had identified this issue with their inventories of meters and identified a $2 million savings specifically that benefits that can be actually parlayed to other service centers that changed their work process.  This CE Way is becoming embedded in our organization and the ability to teach our coworkers to see and eliminate waste and improve their process. It reduces what we call their own human struggle when our coworkers see human struggle that they can reduce it often parlays into dollars, make their job easier to do, makes them more committed to the ownership of the company. And it's another good example of a real savings that get driven by real people who do the real work. And I could not be more proud of the team. Thanks for asking. We have a big debate whether I should include that in the script and I am very happy that you asked Andrew. Andrew Weisel : I mean you'd have one at your fingertips. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Greg Oriel [ph] with UBS. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Greg. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. With the renewables CapEx that you've outlined on slide 22, can you maybe comment on how that, contributes to a rate-based growth or as a portion of overall rate based in the plan? Rejji Hayes : So Greg, what that's comprised of, it's the combination of renewable spend and certainly in the near term portion of this five year plan to get to the RPS, sorry, a renewable portfolio standard of 15% by 2021 as per the energy law. So that's the components you'll see instead of the 2020, 2021 timeframe. And we have good projects in the pipeline that we think will allow us to get there. And then the latter portion, as we've talked about in the past is a part of the IRP related renewable spend. And so again, as we start to execute on this 1.1 gigawatts trench half of which will be owned, half of which will be PPA or contracted that's what's making up the balance of that. In terms of the rate base component, we have of the 1.8 billion of capital, we plan to spend in aggregate over the five year period. It probably drives about or probably represents about 6% of rate base or thereabouts. So not all that significant at this moment, but overtime we will expect that to grow some. But the vast majority of the spend as we've talked on the past is wires and pipes. We think that's where if you really want to get the biggest bang for the buck, it's really in the investment in the safety and reliability of our system, both in gas infrastructure and electric infrastructure. And so that's where you see the vast majority of the rate base span and the rate base growth accordingly. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Congratulations. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from David Fishman with Goldman Sachs. David Fishman : Hi, good morning, and congrats on another consistent year. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, David. Good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning. David Fishman : Good morning. So, I apologize if this is already been asked. But with the natural gas distribution plan filed, given such a long-term look, effectively by program, when would you expect really if at all to file for another IRM or another multi-year mechanism, I mean, just given the detail by category in this filing along with the IRT and it certainly seems like you are potentially positioning consumers to work with commission toward our mechanism of some kind in the 2020s? Patti Poppe : You know, I would offer this David. I have mixed feelings about the IR of long-term plans. Because the reality is the system is dynamic, the demands are dynamic. One of the great strengths of our plan, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks is that we've got a lot of flexibility. This large percent of our spend under $200 million, the ability to file every year simple concrete filings that are part of a long-term plan allow us to adjust when conditions change. And there\u2019s no big bet strategy that we have employed for over a decade now has served as well in our ability to be flexible. And so when you lock-in a three year filing and a system like the gas system where you can have dynamism, maybe you've got new regulations, maybe there's an incident somewhere else in the country that reprioritizes our system and our investment strategy.  I personally liked the flexibility of an annual filing that allows us to go ahead and adjust as necessary. Now, the simplicity of a filing, if you've got multiyear plans certainly can be appealing. And if our commission was leaning that way, and they really preferred that, then of course, we would work with them on that. But I think the idea of that we\u2019re dynamic and so as our plan has more relevance to our ability to deliver consistently. David Fishman : Okay, that makes sense. And then the other item just on the filing. I thought you guys did a good job of breaking out your expectation kind of cost reductions, starting in 2021, kind of through the 2020s. We've heard a lot about on the electric side, the potential fuel cost savings and O&M. But I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate a little bit following kind of extensive review what kind of big buckets or drivers and trajectory you're seeing at the natural gas side in the 2020s? Patti Poppe : Yeah, I'd say the natural gas side, it's all about the efficiency of getting the work done. And with every dollar of capital there's still associated O&M that comes with that. So when we can make our capital more efficient, we can make our O&M more efficient. So we continue to work on our unit costs, on driving our unit costs, on reducing waste from our the ability to execute work, our leak backlog and leak response as a large O&M expense. And so when we make the capital investments that reduce vintage services and service lines and vintage mains, for example, we\u2019re able to reduce operating costs. And we just completed also large capital project on our automated meter reading for our gas meters. And that helps reduce O&M expense as well that obviously reduces the daily walkthrough of someone's backyard and walking down into their basement to read their meter. We cannot do drive by meter reads that's significantly more efficient and safer for our workforce.  So there's lots of operating expense benefits to waste elimination in the gas business as well. David Fishman : Great. Thank you. Those are my questions. Patti Poppe : Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Andrew Levi with ExodusPoint. Please go ahead. Andrew Levi : Hey, good morning. I guess [indiscernible]. Patti Poppe : Good morning. Andrew Levi : Just on EnerBank. Obviously, Rejji, we've discussed kind of the company before. Just what are your thoughts as far as the pros of keeping it first, the pros of potentially not keeping it? Patti Poppe : You know, Andrew, EnerBank is really a valued part of the CMS family. They had a great year. And that's really what we think about EnerBank. They were a great contribution here last year, and in many years in the past. Andrew Levi : Okay, thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to return the conference back to Patti Poppe for any closing remarks. Patti Poppe : Well, thanks, Chad. And thanks again, everyone for joining us this morning. We certainly look forward to seeing you throughout the year. 2020 is going to be a great one. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you everyone for joining our call today. Take care.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 p.m. Eastern Time running through May 4. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Sri Maddipati : Thank you, Alison. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Patti. Patti Poppe : Thank you Sri, and thank you everyone for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. We hope that you're staying safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. This morning, I'll discuss our first quarter results and long-term outlook, as well as provide an update on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rejji will add more details on our financial results later and discuss sensitivities related to COVID-19. And as always, we'll close with QA. I'd like to start by acknowledging that this health crisis is affecting scores of people in really unimaginable ways. My heart is with each of you, and I know that there will be a post COVID. May your family and friends be stronger, closer and at peace when all of this is behind us. You know what always keeps my team and I anchored is our focus on the long-term, and our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. We have a track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance and we have solid fundamentals in our favor that have served us well in years past and will enable us to navigate today and in the future. Now, let's get to the numbers. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.86 in the first quarter, despite challenging weather conditions and the onset of this unprecedented global pandemic. Our first quarter results were $0.11 better than 2019 results for the same period, mostly driven by cost management, regulatory outcomes and our ability to adapt to changing conditions, whether it be the temperatures outside or adjusting to life under a stay at home order. As a stay home, stay safe order is still in place for Michigan and the situation is continuing to evolve, it's too soon to provide an update on our guidance we issued on January 30. So, given the fluidity of the situation, at this time, we're not changing our guidance for the year of $2.64 to $2.68.  Though the current circumstance is certainly challenging, our investment thesis remains intact and our business model resilient, both of which will support our long-term operational and financial objectives, as we continue to target long-term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. Let's take a moment to get everyone up to speed on what we're seeing here in Michigan and what we're doing to lessen COVID related impacts on the communities that we serve. On March 23, Governor Whitmer issued a stay at home order requiring all non-essential businesses to close until April 13, which has now been extended until mid-May with some loosening of retail and recreational restrictions previously in place. Schools are closed for the remainder of the academic year. Prior to the Governor's order, we established our Incident Command Structure or ICS. So, we were already functioning in our emergency response mode as conditions worsened, particularly in the southeast portion of the state. Early on, we retained a Chief Medical Officer to help guide our operational decision-making and ensure we could perform our necessary work safely. We instituted a travel ban for business activities and the necessary self quarantining for employees after any personal travel. We quickly transitioned to a remote workforce, and I'm pleased that the team responded with great agility. For team members and critical on-site operational roles including those working in control rooms, and that generating plants and natural gas compression stations, we've implemented numerous safety protocols following all CDC guidelines, including and in some cases sequestration. For the remaining workforce, our coworkers are either working from home or reporting directly to the jobsite from their homes to continue operations in the field and ensure their safety. At this time, we've experienced zero fatalities, and 11 of our over 8,000 coworkers, our work family have tested positive for COVID-19. Yet, we're thankful that seven of those coworkers have been able to return to work, and they each identified case has yielded fewer and fewer ancillary cases of contact, which means our social distancing is working. Our COVID-19 case rate is three times less than the broader Michigan rate. We believe that our safe work practices have been essential in protecting our coworkers from exposure to this virus. We're taking by-weekly poll surveys of our coworkers to see how they're doing during this time. And I'm very proud to report that over 90% of our team is satisfied with how we're handling the COVID-19 pandemic as a company. Our safety culture and commitment to our people has been a source of strength for all of us, and we'll remain deliberate in our efforts to keep our coworkers and our customers safe. Beyond safety, we know our customers are facing economic challenges and we've stepped up to support them. Some of the most deeply impacted at this time are our small business customers, who are the heart of Michigan's economic engine. When we get on the other side of this current crisis, and there will be another side, our small businesses will serve as an essential role in fueling the economy once again. We know and love these customers and understand the hardships they\u2019re going through, and they have tailored our services accordingly. We've redeployed our business customer care team to help our customers navigate the state and federal assistance programs. We trained our team on the federal and state funding available and created scripts and content specifically tailored to our small business customers. And on a personal level some of you may have seen, my husband Eric and I set up the Dream Maker Fund at the onset of the crisis with a personal contribution, which has provided emergency relief to our small businesses in Jackson, Michigan, where we live and where the company is headquartered. This has given us a front row seat on the small business impact of COVID-19 here in Michigan. The company and Consumers Energy Foundation have also taken a number of actions to help our vulnerable residential customers, including extending our payment protection plans through June 1, dispersing over a $1 million in grants and donations to facilitate the needs of our healthcare workers, supporting our local food banks and charities, as well as matching our coworkers donations to local charities. Needless to say, we haven't lost track of you our investors. We're mindful of the COVID related risks on our business. And we're always on the job identifying those risks and managing the work every year in every aspect of the business. We operate both in natural gas and electric business, and natural gas represents one-third of our revenues at the utility and is the fastest growing segment. The bulk of our gas business margin comes from our residential customers and is earned in the heating season which ended in March, and we expect residential gas sales to be normal in the fourth quarter. While our electric deliveries are certainly down year-over-year, we will remind you that we have a track record of mitigating financial risks given the inherent volatility in our business which I will cover on the next slide. We're grateful for the leadership and partnership our Public Service Commission has demonstrated. We're working together to make sure our coworkers are safe and our customers are cared for. The Commission is collecting and reviewing costs related to COVID-19, including uncollectible accounts and sequestration and quarantine related costs. The Commission established deferred accounting for uncollectible expense above what's currently approved in rates, which Rejji will elaborate on later and speaks to the constructive regulatory environment here in Michigan. As we turn to slide six, we\u2019ll remind you that we've seen significant unforeseen challenges and double-digit EPS downside in previous years. In fact, in 2016 and 2017, we had as much as $0.13 and $0.16 of negative variance. And through conservative planning and a bottoms-up approach to cost management, we were able to deliver on our operational and financial objectives. With that said, as a result of anticipated COVID related financial risks this year, like most, we've implemented several cost control measures, such as a hiring freeze, reduced over time, and minimize travel and training expenses. Plus more sustainably, we\u2019ll rely on our ability to accelerate cost savings and waste elimination through our Consumers Energy Way to pursue our financial objectives without compromising customer service. Rejji will provide some of the sensitivities for the risks we've highlighted and potential offsets.  As we gain more visibility in Q2 and beyond, we'll adjust our plan accordingly to remain agile and make choices that mitigate the impact in 2020 and protect our long-term operational and financial performance. While we don't know the ultimate impact of COVID-19, we do know how to manage and operate a world-class business that delivers over the long-term. And that brings us full circle as we talk to you today. Our long-term investment thesis remains unchanged, despite the near term uncertainty presented by COVID-19. Over the years, we've been good stewards of the balance sheet, maintaining a healthy level of liquidity and we plan conservatively. We still have a large and ageing system and need a significant investment. We still have a constructive regulatory environment and we still have the CE way that enables us to serve our customers, while keeping their energy costs affordable. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you Patti, and good morning everyone. Let me first echo Patti's comments by wishing each of you and your loved ones safe passage through these trying times in which we live. As Patti highlighted, we're pleased to report our first quarter results for 2020. We delivered adjusted net income of $245 million or $0.86 per share. Our adjusted earnings excludes select nonrecurring items, primarily related to costs resulting from a voluntary coworker separation program which we commenced in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the favorable reversal of an accrued expense related to tax reform. For comparative purposes, our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.11 above our Q1 2019 results, largely driven by rate relief, the net investment related expenses of utility and solid cost performance throughout our business. Switching gears to the COVID-19 related financial risks, as Patti noted, we are ever mindful of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business and have begun to implement cost control measures to mitigate these risks. On slide nine, we've provided a summary of potential impacts, as well as several mitigating factors which should help reduce our exposure to some degree. First, I'll start with utility, which I'll remind you, represents over -- about 90% of our business. The effects of the pandemic in Michigan that Patti referenced have unsurprisingly reduced commercial industrial activity in the state, which has begun to materialize in our electric sales. Based on daily volumetric trends extracted from our smart meters over the past month or so, we've seen declines in weather normalized commercial industrial load of about 20% to 25%. The C&I load reduction has been partially offset by residential load, which is up over 5% over the same timeframe presumably due to mass teleworking and self quarantine measures.  As noted in the past, the residential customer segment offers our highest margins and represents over 60% of our customer contribution for electric and gas combined, which I'll discuss in more detail later. The other noteworthy financial risk, the utility, attributable with COVID-19 are potential increased costs and uncollectible accounts due to delays in customer payments and sequestration and quarantine related costs to ensure the safety of our coworkers. As mentioned, we are working hard to mitigate these risks and cost control measures and customer outreach programs. We also recently received an accounting order from the commission to apply to deferred accounting to uncollectible account expenses in excess of rates as Patti noted. And we will soon file a response to this initial order seeking approval to defer other costs related to COVID-19, including sequestration and quarantine related costs. As for non-utility businesses, which collectively represent about 10% of the earnings, the potential risks are largely on the revenue side and broadly speaking are fairly well mitigated. And enterprises a vast majority of its revenue streams are contracted at fixed prices with credit worthy counterparties. It is also worth noting that the Supreme Court of Michigan recently issued an order, upholding the MPSCs ability to enforce a local clearing requirement for all energy providers in the state. Longer term, this decision could create opportunities for DIG, given the favorable trends we've observed in the last two planning resource auctions in MISO for Zone 7 which just cleared the cost of new entry. With regards to EnerBank, the primary risk in the current environment are loan origination volume and a potential increase in charge offs. But it's important to remember that the business model EnerBank is unique. We are not underwriting mortgages or making auto or small business loans. EnerBank underwrites home improvement loans primarily to premium credit quality borrowers whose average FICO scores are above 750. This borrower base has proven to be relatively more resilient during economic downturns. And in fact, in 2008 EnerBank\u2019s originations increased given the relative inelasticity of its core borrower base and through market share gains at the expense of weaker capitalized competitors.  The final notable risk from an earnings perspective is in our parent and other segment, which is largely comprised of non-recoverable financing costs. I am pleased to report that due to proactive and cost effective liquidity management from our treasury team, we have no remaining maturities in 2020 and it fully priced our planned equity issuance needs for the year through forward contracts, which I'll elaborate on later. Circling back on the utility sales risk, which we've viewed the most substantial risk to our business in the current environment, slide 10 highlights the relative contribution mix of our customer segments and the load reductions we've witnessed since late March. As you'll note, the residential segment represents approximately 60% and 75% of the customer contribution for the electric and gas business respectively and over 60% of the total customer contribution at utilities I highlighted earlier. So, any uptick and growth in the residential segment should partially offset the expected declines we anticipate in the commercial and industrial segments. All-in, given the current sales trends we've observed since the public response to the pandemic, we estimate approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS dilution per month. As Patty noted, at this point, it's too early to tell how long and to what extent social distancing measures will remain in place or how strong the economic recovery in Michigan will be upon its conclusion. As such, we have provided this monthly sensitivity for your modeling purposes and we'll keep your breasts at any material changes to our plan. On slide 11 in our waterfall chart you can see the key factors impacting our financial performance relative to 2019. Despite an unusually warm winter which offered $0.23 of negative variance versus Q1 of 2019, the absence of the substantial service restoration costs due to storms we experienced last year, coupled with last September supportive gas rate order and cost performance throughout the business, delivered $0.11 of net positive variance versus the first quarter of 2019. Depending on the extent to which the financial risks of COVID-19 manifest, we believe the glide path illustrated on this slide could enable us to achieve our EPS guidance as we plan for normal weather and anticipate a constructive order and our pending gas case in mid-October. As mentioned, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on Michigan's economy and our business remains uncertain, so we have referenced the estimate monthly EPS dilution of $0.03 to $0.04 in the event the level of sales degradation that we have witnessed to date persists. Further, we will closely monitor the potential risk to our business, some of which have been mitigated through regulatory support. We have also added the historical range of annual financial risks that we have successfully mitigated over the past several years, which equates to approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share or $40 million to $70 million pre-tax. Clearly, we have a strong track record of managing the work and delivering cost reductions through our lean operating system the CE way and other initiatives. And as Patti noted, we've already implemented an initial wave of cost control measures. Needless to say, we are not here to represent that any downside scenario can be overcome, particularly given the unprecedented nature of this global pandemic. However, we are confident that we can minimize the financial risk in 2020 without jeopardizing our long-term value proposition to our customers and investors. As we execute our risk mitigation strategies, you'll note on slide 12 that we have prioritized liquidity management and have over $2.3 billion of net liquidity available, which includes unrestricted cash and untaught -- untapped revolving credit facility capacity as of March 31.  We've always managed our balance sheet in conservative manner and so whether there've been a lot of concerns regarding access to the commercial paper market, I'll remind everyone that we do not rely on CP as a permanent layer of funding, nor do we have any outstanding at this time. As part of our funding strategy for the year, we put in place term loans to the parent and the utility for $300 million each and those don't mature until 2021. And in mid-March we issued $575 million of first mortgage bonds at a rate of 3.5%, which addressed our sole maturity across our debt issuing entities in 2020 and funds our capital programs.  From an equity financing perspective, we announced on our Q4 call, our plans to issue up to $250 million of equity, all of which is priced under existing equity forward contracts and we drew down approximately a $100 million of that capacity in late March. We expect future equity issuances can be completed through our ATM program, which we will likely refile in the coming months. All of our financings have been executed at terms favorable to our plan, which offer entry year savings and help derisk the future. As we look forward, we'll continue to maintain flexibility and capitalize on accommodated market conditions when they emerge. Highlight with our credit metrics on slide 13 which remained well above the thresholds for investment grade ratings among all three credit rating agencies. Our focused on maintaining a strong financial position coupled with a supportive regulatory environment and predictable operating cash flow growth supports our strong ratings, and we'll look to maintain our strong credit quality with an eye toward the future to the benefit of customers and investors. And with that, I'll pass it back to Patti for some closing comments before we open up the lines for Q&A. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Rejji. My coworkers and I remained on the job every day for our customers and for you, our owners. We're focused on delivering an essential service to nearly 6.7 million of our fellow Michiganders. The capital you all provide is critical and our long-term track record of managing that capital speaks to that commitment. As I mentioned, we've been good stewards of our balance sheet, with prudent planning and our conservative liquidity management continues. Already for 2020 we executed financings at attractive rates that enable us to fund our capital programs. Our operational excellence shines through during times like these. As we continue to rely on the CE way and lean in on that lean operating system we have in place, we improve each and every day. We put to work efficiencies that drive down costs and eliminate waste. And I can tell you that system is in overdrive right now, which speaks to our agility as we shift accordingly depending on how this current environment evolves.  Since the 2008 energy law was established and updated again in 2016, Michigan has remained a top tier regulatory jurisdiction. With forward-looking test years and 10 months rate cases, we're fortunate to have such a constructive regulatory framework in statute. We also have a supportive commission. As you can see by the recent order responding to the pandemic for the protection of vulnerable customers while being mindful of utility, being able to fund its operations and attract low cost long-term capital. Our system remains in great need of replacements and upgrades and that won't go away as a result of the current pandemic. Again, we're fortunate that our plans have embedded structural cost reductions in the form of retiring coal plants and PPAs expiring. Finally, none of this comes at a price to our planet and the great state of Michigan we all love so dearly. Our net zero carbon and methane goals remain as important today as the day we establish them. Our model holds together well. That's why this thesis remains intact and that's why we can rely on our triple bottom line to get us through this current crisis just it has in the past and will do so in the future.  With that, Alison, will you please open the lines for Q&A? Operator : Thank you very much, Patti. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. One moment please. Thank you. And Shar, your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Shar Pourreza : Hey, good morning guys. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Shar. Rejji Hayes : Morning. Shar Pourreza : Couple of questions here. So, first off, you talked about the $0.03 to $0.04 impact per month based on the sales sensitivities that you provided on slide 10. You're obviously levelizing this, but should we expect any kind of peaks or troughs over the next two quarters? I mean, some utilities assume business closures in Q2, some return in Q3 and a bit more of a mean reversion in Q4. I know we're only two months into this, but just trying to get a sense on the monthly profile of your sensitivities you assume in plan or really what the guidance can withstand. Obviously, on slide four there seems to be a little bit of cautious language around the uncertainty of duration and the full impact of COVID. So I know -- what are your prelim thoughts even though it's very early stage? Patti Poppe : Shar, thanks for asking. We've tried to be really transparent here. We have a track record of offsetting negative impacts, the EPS, as you mentioned, ranging in as much $0.10 to 0.15. We also have a track record of transparency, which is why we've tried to be as direct and forthcoming as we can about the C&I sales that have dropped 20% to 25% versus expectations. And with then the offsetting residential sales up over 5%, the earnings impact, as you've mentioned and what we've said, is $0.03 to $0.04 per month under the current condition. Now, here's the variables. How fast will businesses bounce back? How soon will people gather in public spaces? How quickly will manufacturers be able to start making non-essential goods again? Our stay at home order is still in place till May 15. Will the government stimulus help so that the small businesses can come back after this? At this point, there's just too many unknowns, Shar. And so, while we'll continue to remain conservative, we don't feel that we know enough right now. And so I guess I would offer this thing. One thing you can count on us to do is to call it straight. We've never over promised and under delivered, and nor have we really under promised and over delivered. We do what we say. I'm comfortable in the fact that our long-term fundamentals are the same and our short term actions will stand the test of time. One of the things, Shar, I think about a lot is that our customers, our coworkers and our regulators will long remember how we handle these temporary times. I feel good about that because we're doing the right things and we like always are acting with the long-term in mind and the long-term outlook has not changed and our fundamentals remain sound. So, as we think about any adjustments we would make this year or any actions we would take this year, we're always thinking about the next year and the next. And so, we're balancing all of those factors and doing everything we can to serve the triple bottom line. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Let me just -- let's -- let's assume this is a little bit more protracted. Can you talk about sort of the incremental levers as you mentioned $0.12 to -- $0.10 to $0.15 of historical flex range on slide 11, do you have more? Patti Poppe : What I would say is our historical performance is a good indicator, but we've also -- now we're about four years into the CE Way and that thing is on overdrive. And our team is on the job. They're looking for waste elimination all across the organization. We have 1,254 projects already identified this year. Start the day, time reduction. Some of the things that we're doing now as a result of the crisis, such as jobsite reporting, are actually saving money. And so, it's both the combination of current factors. There's current environmental things that allow us to save money plus our CE Way and the waste elimination and our ability to deploy our team to as much long-term capital work are the kinds of ways that we see tackling this challenge in a sustainable way. We're always thinking about the next year and the next. And so the cost savings that we would do would only be those that don't do damage to the future. The one thing, we think about we're not going to pull out all the stops and do damage to future years to hit some kind of unreasonable outcome this year. We're going to be in it for the long haul. And I think that's why people trust us and invest in us. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then just lastly, the volume reductions on the C&I side, the 20% to 25% reduction that you've seen since March. Can -- is that sort of auto, auto supplier related? what drove that? Patti Poppe : We have a limited exposure to auto, less than 2% tier one suppliers plus the automotive themselves to our margin. What we're seeing is more the stay home order closed all restaurants, it closed all retail other than non-essential retail like grocery. And so that's where we're really seeing a lot -- and small manufacturers that aren't making essential goods. As I mentioned, my husband and I did this fund and so we've had an opportunity to look at all of the applications just in Jackson County and it's a whole range of things, golf courses, restaurants, bakeries, retail, little manufacturing shops, welding shops. They're in a holding pattern right now, waiting for the order to be lifted. And some of those businesses, even after the order is lifted, will be affected by people's reticence to gather in groups. Others will get right back at it. And so, we see a balance between some of them just purely waiting for May 15, and they'll be back on it full time. And there'll be others that may have a demand reduction because of people's fear. And so, again, there's a lot of unknowns. And fortunately, our smart meter data is very accurate and we can see real-time what's happening and it helps us make better decisions and better choices. Shar Pourreza : Terrific. Thank you, guys. Stay safe and we'll see you soon. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Shar. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research LLC. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Great. Thank you. Patti, Rejji, Sri, hope you're all doing well and your families. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Steve. Good morning. Rejji Hayes : Same to you Steve. Steve Fleishman : Yeah. Good. So, just the first on the sales. That March to April data, do you have just an overall number across the - the overall sales change? Patti Poppe : Rejji, what's our total sales adjustment then? Rejji Hayes : Yeah, so, we don't have -- if you're talking about post Q1 beyond March 31, we do not have a full read across all of our customers, because smart meter data\u2026 Steve Fleishman : Okay. Rejji Hayes : \u2026 [indiscernible] good portion of our customers are select classes of large industrial and commercial customers that do not have smart meter data available. We do get good anecdotal evidence from those customers and do get good visibility, but we don't get perfect information really until we get to the end of the quarter. So, there are some limitations in that. But I would say, Steve, going back to Patti's comments, the 20% to 25% we highlight here again that is not indicative of all of our customers, but it's a decent read for now for that monthly read that we've offered from late March through kind of mid to late April. So that's a -- again, it's not a every single customer, but it's a decent portion of them. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Yeah, just curious because when we've looked at regions, we're not really seeing any region down more than 10% or so, but obviously that doesn't get to individual states or territories. So, I'm just kind of trying to compare it to some of the regional data we've seen --? Patti Poppe : Yeah, Steve, I would say 10% total is a decent bogey that -- for our customer base as well. You're in the neighborhood for sure. Rejji Hayes : That's exactly right. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. And then on this $0.03 to $0.04 per month thing data, a lot of utilities have different per -- depending on the season, the earnings impacts of the same sales change can vary, like a summer month might be worth more than a shoulder month. So, could you just talk about the seasonality of that sensitivity and just thinking about it this year? Patti Poppe : Well, we always deal with seasonality and the weather and that's what we certainly -- weather and storms, we've done a good job overcoming. In this scenario, there are so many, I would suggest the bigger drivers than just the weather that seasonality is obviously clearly a variable, but not nearly as much as some of the unknowns associated with the rate the businesses return to action. I don't know, Rejji, you might want to add something to that though. Go ahead. Rejji Hayes : The only thing I would add is that it's certainly the timing of this is -- somewhat fortunate because we do expect higher volumes as it starts to go a little warmer particularly in the residential class now. So, we'll see more industrial activity sort of as you get past those shoulder months. And so, the timing of this, I guess if you could it happen at any time, which you don't root for, this would be the time to have it. And so certainly there are greater expectations for load once you get beyond sort of the March/April timeframe. Steve Fleishman : Maybe I should have asked the question different. Patti Poppe : Well, I'll just chime in. One last thing, Steve, that one of the points that we recognize is that even after an order is lifted, it's likely -- and I'm hearing from a lot of businesses that they'll keep their staff, their people working from home if they can. And so that residential bump may continue into the summer months and obviously air conditioning load is a big driver in Michigan to sales in the summertime. And so, if all of those folks are still or if a lot of people are still working from home that obviously has a favorable impact in the summer months. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Maybe I should have just asked, do you have a summer/winter kind of rate differential, or is it pretty much the same rate all year? Patti Poppe : Generally the same rate all year. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Patti Poppe : So, next year we'll be implementing a more of a summer peak rate, but it's generally about the same throughout the year. Steve Fleishman : Got it. Okay. And then one last question, just could you talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing so far on non-payments and kind of how notable that might be, any color there? Patti Poppe : We are watching that. The -- one of the things with the uncollectible accounts is they do lag. And so we can see to some degree, it's very early. If you can imagine, it's at a minim a 30-day lag so before we know if somebody didn't pay their bill. And so sometimes the uncollectible accounts really take almost three to six months to show up and to really be accounted for. And so, we're watching -- we're seeing a slight uptick, but it's early. It's -- we haven't even crossed all of the cycles for some of the customers. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Steve. Stay well. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hi. Good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning. Michael Weinstein : Hey, just to follow-up on some of those last questions. Can you speak to how some of this will be handled in the ongoing rate changes? So, I can have an almost annual electric rate case and an ongoing case it was just saw in February. So, how does that case get updated for changes to load -- changes and changes uncollectible and everything? Patti Poppe : Yeah. The cases are filed. Our gas case we filed in December and our electric case we filed here in February. So, there's not a clean way to have a significant substantive change to sales and frankly it would be hard to do it because we have forward test years. So what sales figure would we predict? So, we expect that our rate cases will continue as planned and because we do annual filings in the future, if there's a permanent degradation to sales, then we would reflect it. But it's pretty hard to capture a temporary degradation in sales like the one we're seeing in any kind of active filing. The good news is that our commission has been very supportive, just a shout out to the Michigan Public Service Commission and all their folks for adapting so quickly to this changing condition. They've already started holding their meetings and conducting business remotely through webcast. They too have had a significant impact. So thanks to all of them for acting so quickly and working with us on this new order for the CV-19 costs as well as the uncollectible accounts and trying to make sure that we, as a utility, are in a position to serve our customers well, do what's right, care for our most vulnerable customers and know that we can still function in a strong financial position that that reflects the capital attraction that we need to demonstrate. And so, great partnership with the commission and all their team, working so hard to just figure out these unknowables together. Michael Weinstein : Gotcha. And could you contemplate lower capital spending, if necessary things drag on long enough. Patti Poppe : Yeah. Right now, we're not seeing that in the plan. And in fact, we're working hard to make sure that -- for example, our power plants because energy load and demand is down, are an economic reserve, a couple of our coal plants. And so that gives us an opportunity to pull ahead of capital outage at that plant earlier in the year than we had originally planned. So, I don't -- we don't have any plans in the near term to have any adjustment to our capital plan. In fact, we're going to really work hard to make sure we keep that plan on track. Michael Weinstein : Got it. And on DIG, just wanted to ask about the local clearing requirement. It doesn't look like the impact of that Supreme Court decision would probably have to [technical difficulty] itself beyond. I just wanted to make sure. Patti Poppe : Yeah, the -- it -- because DIG is basically fully contracted, it doesn't have any certain impact on 2020, minimal in 2021, but there could be some out year impact that could be beneficial. But again, just keep in mind the DIG is predominantly contracted as Rejji had mentioned with high quality off taker. We are pleased with the outcome of that order though, and shout out to our legal team took it all the way to, the Supreme Court of Michigan did a great job advocating for the Public Service Commission and their authority to require a local clearing requirement. The law that we worked so hard to pass back in 2016, that was a fundamental element of it to make sure that Michigan as a Peninsula Zone 7 has adequate supply to serve the load. And with our kind of hybrid retail open access 10%, it does put at risk reliability in the state. So very happy with that outcome and very thankful and proud of my legal team for the great work that they did. Michael Weinstein : Yeah. It looks good. Hey, one last question on AMT credits and acceleration and the stimulus bill, have you guys quantified that at all? Patti Poppe : Yeah. So, we've benefited -- and remember it's just a cash benefit, but about $30 million of AMT credits, we'll pull forward in 2020, that would have originally been refunded in 2021. Again, that just affects cash, not earnings in any way. Michael Weinstein : And that\u2019s all I have. Take care guys. Stay healthy. Patti Poppe : Thank you, Michael. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Hey, good morning to you. Hope you all are well. Patti Poppe : Morning, Julien. You too. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Excellent. So, just wanted to follow-up. You all are maintaining your guidance. So when you think about the sales forecast that you're embedding in that, I understand the $0.03 to $0.4 here and sort of as a sensitivity, but what are you specifically thinking about in making that statement to reaffirm rather than withdraws? We've seen perhaps more so in other sectors. And to be even more specific about it, I think you've alluded to perhaps $0.15 or $0.16 of historical perhaps cost flexibility in your plans. Can you talk to that too as you think about what the latitude reaffirmed here? Patti Poppe : So, Julien and I know everyone wants precision in these uncertain times. And there's a reason why the word unprecedented is like the number one word in youth these days. We just haven't been here before. So, as we said, it's just too soon for us to update our guidance. And it would mean that we know exactly how to help -- how the health crisis ends, how the economy will look afterwards, and frankly we don't know. And so, there are reasons to believe in a bounce back. The federal stimulus is working or watching. It helps small businesses, but can the businesses get access to it? Construction, manufacturing, ag can bounce back quickly and work safely, but will there be demand? I talked to an office furniture CEO, most of the office furniture in the world is made right here in Michigan and I talked to one of the CEOs last week and they may be at all time highs because they save workplaces need to be reorganized and new furniture is going to be required or maybe none of us are reporting to an office ever again. There's just a lot of changes. Will there be a drive in residential electricity demand? We've talked about that already. Maybe there will be. The shelter in place order can be lifted, but how long will people feel -- will it be before people feel safe to congregate in a public gathering. I don't know. We don't know. But here's what we do know, Julien. We know that we need our coworkers healthy and motivated to do our capital plan and it's a good infrastructure plan that serves the people of Michigan. We need our regulators to trust that we're doing what's right and taking care of both our coworkers and our customers. We need our customers to be with us and to survive this pandemic and be open for business when it's over, which is why we're working so hard to serve them with new information and help them navigate the circumstances. What we can do is continue to run this business and look to mitigate costs and risks as they come up and never lose focus. And as I mentioned earlier on the long-term fundamental they're solid, right? The fundamentals of the business are the same. How we handle it in this temporary condition, as I mentioned, will be long remembered and so the cost savings, additional cost savings, what we would do to mitigate it are all going to be with an eye on the future. We're not going to take short term risks on a tomorrow's performance. And so, we're going to do our darnedest, us, how we think and how we operate. Again, our CE way is a great source of comfort to me, because we've actually developed some real capability across the organization and just in overdrive as I mentioned. So, given all that, I would say, it's too soon to say, but trust me, we're not waiting on the sidelines to figure it out. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Got it. And then related question, super quick. I mean, you all are working proactively with the PSC here to address a recovery of certain items. How do you think about that being reflected again in numbers, specifically 20 here as you continue to move through the course of the year? I just want to be clear about that given some differences in the sector. Patti Poppe : Well, we're going to have to see. We'll be filing our response. They've asked for comments, which is a very important and constructive. We need to hear from a lot of people as we make these determinations. Once the accounting is clarified and we've got certainty about that, then we can account for it. And then we'll have benefits obviously in 2020. They've been pretty clear about the uncollectible expenses as a result of a mandate to not shut off our most vulnerable customers, our seniors and low-income through June 1. And so, they've been pretty clear about those uncollectible expenses and the accounting treatment thereof, but it's really some of the other expenses and exactly the timing of that uncollectible when it materializes et cetera. So, others will be weighing in, and certainly I can't speak for the MPSC, but I can just say that we're working together to make sure that we're able to serve the most vulnerable constructively. Julien Dumoulin Smith : All right. Well, I'll leave it there. Thank you all very much. Patti Poppe : Thanks Julien. Operator : Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Hi. Good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Byrd : Wanted to give congrats on all the community outreach efforts that you all are making. It looks like a lot of great stuff going on. Patti Poppe : Thanks. Stephen Byrd : Wanted to -- a lot of my questions have been addressed, but just on the EnerBank side of things, could you just talk a little bit more about new business opportunities that you're seeing? I guess I'm certainly not a bank analyst, but I would have thought sort of home improvement activity would be going down a great deal, but I was just curious what you're seeing on certain new business. Patti Poppe : Well, I've been doing all the talking, so I'm going to hand it over to Rejji. He is the Chairman of the EnerBank Board. I'll let him speak about the great work that the EnerBank team is up to. Go ahead, Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thanks Patti. And good morning, Stephen. So Stephen, I would say that -- and that's certainly we did see a little bit of a slowdown in March on origination volume, but we've actually been encouraged with what we're seeing in April. And it's important to note a couple of things. So, every state has a different approach to the executive orders that have rolled out, but financial service is deemed an essential service and that's a federal mandate. And so, we've managed to continue our underwriting and also, construction projects that are work in progress or quipped. For all intents and purposes, those bits of work have also been permitted to continue on. And so, we really haven't seen the type of slowdown you would anticipate for some of the loans that EnerBank has historically underwritten. So, I would say encouraged by what we're seeing in April unsurprisingly, a little bit of a slowdown in March. And we still think, they started the quarter off or the year off pretty well, about a penny above the prior year. And we're only asking for about a penny to two of growth year-over-year for them and they appear to be on track. And so, the other opportunities as you think about origination volume is also on the gain share side. And so what we've seen in the past, particularly in 2008/2009 is you had a lot of weaker capitalized competitors who kind of fell by the wayside. And we've already seen anecdotally some large customers come our way, because they know that EnerBank is in it for the long haul. This is their primary focus. And so, we've actually taken some share, which we also did in 2008/2009. And so, just existing originations and continuing to execute on our plan as well as taking share also create opportunities this year. And so, we feel good about the road ahead where we sit at this point. Stephen Byrd : That's really helpful, Rejji. Thank you. And then just one other question on your 2020 EPS slide 11. More of a housekeeping item, but just you mentioned the historical flex range of $0.10 to $0.15 on that slide. And I just wondered what timeframe? Is that annual, is that for the nine months to go? I just want to make sure I understood that. Patti Poppe : Rejji, you can go ahead. Rejji Hayes : Sure. Great. So, yeah, we look at that range and it's based on what we've done historically over the last several years. And so, we've seen that level of negative variance in a quarter. We've seen over the course of the year, but we've managed to and in historical context, overcome levels of flex of that magnitude or levels of negative variance of that magnitude. As I look at this year we certainly think that $0.10 to $0.15 year to go is certainly within us. And let's just think about what that math equates to. So, on the low end about $40 million pretax, on the high end call it $60 million to $65 million. And when you think about our year to go spend, we've got about a $1 billion of, I'll say, actionable opportunities between operating and non-operating cost pools. So that reduction equates to a little more than 5%, which is certainly within us. And so not to suggest it's easy and to Patti's earlier point, we're not going to do anything that's rash or detrimental to the years to come. And so, we do feel like it's within us, but at the end of the day we'll have to see how this situation in Michigan materializes, and we'll make prudent decisions as we always do. Stephen Byrd : That's great. Thank you. That's all I have. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Stephen. Operator : Our next question will come from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Patti Poppe : Hi, Jonathan. Operator : One moment please. And Jonathan, your line is open. Please proceed. Jonathan Arnold : My question was just answered. Thank you. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : All right. Jonathan Arnold : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next -- and our next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. One moment please. Okay. Mr. Weisel, your line is open. Andrew Weisel : Hi. Good morning everyone. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : To go back to this $0.03 to $0.04 monthly EPS impact from lower volumes, if I'm reading that correctly, that's only on the electric side. Do you have preliminary April data for gas demand? And what that might mean for a monthly run rate? It's a shoulder season, of course, but do you have any kind of ballpark rule of thumb for the gas side? Patti Poppe : Yeah, first of all, as I mentioned, Andrew, the bulk of our gas is certainly during the heating season and that is behind us. That ends in March. And so, the $0.03 to $0.04 represents electric and gas for your sensitivity. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Good. Thank you. Then last question is for the two rate cases outstanding, have the conversations changed much given COVID-19? I know you're always laser focused on affordability. But are you hearing more concerns about things like the jump in unemployment and that were presumably in a recession? And as part of that, do you see any potential for the timing to be elongated, whether that's due to logistics or affordability concerns? Patti Poppe : Affordability is always factored into our filings to begin with. And so, for example, gas, our gas bills or customer's bills are down 30%, because of commodity benefits. And so, I personally think there's no time like now with the commodity prices where they are and how it's clear they're going to remain where they are, that we make the system safer. The system safety and the priority of the infrastructure investments on that system don't change because of this. And thankfully the commodity price is so low, so we can continue to keep our bills affordable both on the electric and the gas. And net-net, we're starting to really pay attention to the percent of household wallet that our bills play and they're in the 3% to 3.5% combined gas and electric. And we feel like that's extremely affordable. And so that's always been the focus in our cases and it will continue to be, but we feel good given the combination of the commodity price plus the value that the infrastructure investments has for customers. Rejji Hayes : Andrew, you also asked about just process and timing. And the only thing I would add to that end is that the commission has -- like a lot of organizations and businesses and Michigan has transitioned quite nicely to mass teleworking and they have not missed a beat to date. And so, we've had very close communications with them. They have managed to keep up their adjudicated processes. And we also highlighted that they had a meeting on the 15th where they gave us that very constructive order on the COVID-19 related costs. So, they are on track, but it's also worth noting that per the statute, there was a 10-month stipulated period. And so in the event there are delays. We do have the legal right to self implement at that 10-month period, which for gas is around mid March and for electric it's in very late December. Andrew Weisel : Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. And just to clarify though on affordability, I think that was a great recap of your side of it. My question was more from interveners or regulators themselves or staff, has there been any kind of heightened concern about it, given what's going on in the economy? Patti Poppe : I think their concerns are consistent with concerns in the past that we will be concerned and they are too. And so we're pretty well aligned in that attention and focus. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Andrew, one more thing, just to circle back, apologies, but the gas -- the timing of that is mid October, I mentioned mid-March. Mid October, excuse me. Operator : Okay. And our next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller : Thank you. Good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Travis. Travis Miller : Okay. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the renewable side. How much were you expecting in terms of project completion or contracts to sign this year? And what are your thoughts? What are you seeing in terms of being able to get to those numbers plus or minus your expectations for the year? Patti Poppe : Yeah, our big projects this year are a couple of wind projects that are scheduled to close by year-end. And both of those are on track. We have been issued force majeure letters, but that doesn't mean that work stops. It's just sort of a forewarning that there may be a shortage in access to equipment, whether it's turbines or some other equipment. So we have been notified, but to date the projects have not been delayed. And so we are on track. We've continued construction through this time period. And so, as of now everything is on track. Travis Miller : Okay. What about contracts signed or are the other projects, third party projects, they're saying, are they going along also? Patti Poppe : Yeah. Everything's on track for this calendar year. Yeah. Travis Miller : Okay. And then real quick on the dividends, obviously the board decided the dividends well before we knew the seriousness of the COVID situation. Any chance, any metrics that they might be looking at here in the next couple quarters in terms of making a dividend change given the raise last quarter? Patti Poppe : Yeah, I would suggest that there's no plan changed or dividend policy or strategy. Things would have to change very dramatically for there to be a change in that light. So, we have a board meeting next week. We'll be reviewing with them. Certainly our -- or later this week rather, we've got a board meeting, and so we'll obviously be talking with them about a range of scenarios, but none of those scenarios at this time contemplate any change to the dividend policy. Travis Miller : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning. Thanks for sneaking me here. And I appreciate the granularity in this slides is always. Just wanted to stay with a quick clarification. I think I am understanding this correctly, but in response to Steve's question, you mentioned 10% decline. Is that across all classes? So the sensitivity of $0.03 to $0.04 EPS hit per month has based on the commercial industrial 20%, 25%. That's what you're seeing is March, but the 10% is across all classes. Is that right? Patti Poppe : Correct. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, you mentioned you previously have been able to offset double-digit EPS headwinds through some of the cost mitigation efforts. Could you point to something in terms of what can you do? Are those things one-time in nature or could you take costs out of the business longer term? Any examples or any color would be helpful? Patti Poppe : Well, Durgesh, thank you for asking. I've been waiting to share my story of the month. I'm just going to assume that's what you're asking me for. So, here we go. Even in these times. So in fact, I think this one might be the story of this era. We've discovered that we can work remotely. So, let me just give you some numbers. So, in an annual period, we typically spend about $10 million a year reimbursing mileage. We have a large geographic service area and people have felt compelled to be in person for meetings and events. Frankly, I'm the one who makes them. I like to see people, I like to be with people. So I say, hey, come on out, be in person. But based on this circumstance in the COVID-19, we've been forced to learn to use technology and it's working actually. And it's sort of a triple bottom line story of the month, because first of all, people are safer certainly at this time because of COVID, but also minimizing mileage and driving, reduces the risk of a vehicle accident. The plan is better off with less vehicle emissions and our profits are better because the costs are lower. So, we can do video calls. They work. I used to avoid the face to face video calls. We just do the dial in and they're not the same. And we've learned and frankly I think there's a business to be had for the Judy Jetson masks. And if you're too young to know what I'm talking about, just YouTube Judy Jetson mask. There's an opportunity because sometimes we don't want to see our messy hair and without the salons being open, everyone's hair's looking pretty messy and the dog's barking. But the truth be told. We set this big ambition that we come together by staying apart and we're finding our culture is getting activated. People actually are coming closer. It's very interesting time. But on the fundamental cost, $10 million in mileage, you can bet we're going to be reimbursing less than that. There's other things that we do on the waste elimination. We've got a host, as I said 1,254 projects. Some of it is shortening our -- what's called non-premise time. When a crew goes to a service center, shows up to pick up materials and then reports to the jobsite, there can be an hour there that is considered non-premise time. That's expense. Their capital work doesn't commence until they start on the jobsite. So, the fact that we can get people to jobsites more quickly and we're re redesigning our supply chain so the materials can be available on site as opposed to people having to come to service centers is actually another great example of how this current circumstances is creating innovation, but permanent waste elimination that we can deploy in years to come. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Thank you. Yeah. Definitely did. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question today will come from Ryan Levine of Citi. Please go ahead. Ryan Levine : Good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Levine : Do any of your O&M or CapEx contracts have force majeure contract provisions that are impacted by this pandemic? Patti Poppe : Well, as I mentioned, we've had force majeure notices on some of our large renewable projects, but they're not affecting the timing or the outcome of those projects at this time. Ryan Levine : So there was no impact on O&M contracts or any of the other contracts? Patti Poppe : We've not had any notifications of that on our other contracts. Ryan Levine : Okay. And then can you provide more color on the potential items included in the cost reduction initiative flex that you highlighted, and what portion are more temporary nature versus long-term? Patti Poppe : Yeah, so a hiring freeze is obviously temporary, but things like -- we've started using technology and we were just starting this before the pandemic. That's why I'm so grateful that our CUA has been in place now for several years, because we've been deploying capabilities to our top waste opportunities. So, here's a great example. We've been what's called auto dispatching a storm proof. So, in the past we would wait for, in that -- call it a year ago -- we would have a customer call us, notify that their power was out. We would start to aggregate all that data in a dispatch center and then a person would determine, okay, we have this many outages on this circuit and they would schedule a crew. Well, now, we have automated all of that. We've used our digital capabilities, our IT team and our engineering and operations teams have been working together and agile teams actually all across the company. But this is one example of how they now auto dispatch storm crews. It saves 30 minutes on an outage per customer. And it eliminates the actual work of doing the dispatching, because it's done by a computer. It's more accurate and it's cheaper. So, it's just things like that all across the company. I think it's tempting for management teams to want to have big line items. We're a believer in the CUA and our continuous improvement mindset says little line items all across the company are going to be more sustainable and have grander benefits in the long run to both the experience for customers, as well as our fundamental cost structure. Ryan Levine : Thanks. And then last question for me. What are you seeing in terms of working capital fluctuations in light of the 10 -- directionally 10% or decline post COVID-19, any meaningful fluctuations that impact your financing plan? Patti Poppe : Rejji, do you want to talk through the financing plan a little bit? Rejji Hayes : Yeah, happy to. Yeah. So the quick answer is, working capital actually has been fairly smooth or I'll just say aligning with plan. As mentioned we have no CP outstanding and generally that would be, I'll say, a supplemental source of financing if we saw unpredictable working capital swings. But we obviously have been able to manage the working capital volatility to date, and there hasn't been much of that. And so we have not seen at this point any really material changes in working capital. But as Patti highlighted earlier, there's a bit of a lag when it comes to receivables aging. And so we'll continue to keep an eye on that. We obviously are very flush up from a cash perspective as evidenced by our proactive financings that we did at the end of the quarter. So, a little over $700 million in cash in that plus our evolving facility capacity gets us about $2.3 billion net liquidity position. So, we certainly feel like we have enough dry powder to manage any future volatility. But I haven't seen a whole lot to date to be honest. Ryan Levine : Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thanks. Patti Poppe : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : And our next question today will come from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Fishman : Hi, good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning, David. David Fishman : Thanks for taking my question. Just wanting to go back to the C&I demand numbers again. I think I remember that there was a large customer kind of pre-COVID that's sort of already was a bit of a drag on your kind of your year-on-year comparables. Am I remembering that correctly? And kind of how much of that 20% to 25% that customer represent those already known? Patti Poppe : That is correct. We have one large customer who had some contracts bought out at the end -- actually part way through last year. And so, they're reflected in last year sales and this year sales. And they're operating now, so they are actually essential, which is good. But they are at diminished load, so they are a portion of that 20% to 25%. David Fishman : Okay. But some of that then would already have been planned for when you were thinking about the 2020 guidance? Rejji Hayes : That's true. We factor that into our plans for this year. David Fishman : Okay. And then, not to like to beat a dead horse here. But just on the flex range, when we think about the $0.10 to $0.15 that you guys have talked about historically speaking, now I know there's a lot of unknowns going forward with 2020. But when you kind of achieve those levels those were more or less to kind of meet your earnings targets specifically. Like you had a certain amount of negative in that year and then you flex to meet that. And that's kind of what you're illustrating for us here today? Patti Poppe : That's right. That's right. And it's, and it's been true on the other side as well, that when we've had favorability, we've pulled in costs and I'm prepared for the next year. And so the thing that I don't want loss on anyone, it's that we are always preparing, not just for this quarter or this year, but for years to come. And that's what has made us so reliable at delivering and doing exactly what we said we're going to do. And so that flex has upside and downside. That's why slide 6 shows that -- that range of up and down and obviously this is a down year and we are doing everything we can to leverage our skills and capability of adapting in that range. David Fishman : Okay. Thank you Patti. Those are my questions. So, everyone's family is safe and healthy. Patti Poppe : Thank you, David. You too. Operator : Our next question will come from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Very good morning. Patti Poppe : Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson : Thanks. First of all, congratulations on the Supreme court victory. If that, - I assuming that that's it for the state, but is there any other appeal or anything going on at the federal level or where we finally finished with this - this proceeding? Patti Poppe : There's one other aspect of the local clearing requirement that is still being determined and it's a very procedural element, but fundamentally reauthorize -- reconfirming that the public service commission has the authority to establish a local clearing requirement, was a very important outcome. They have returned then the proceedings, the procedures back to the MPSC for implementation. So there's -- it still needs to be implemented, I guess I should say, but it -- the order was very important in the ruling by the Supreme court was very important. Paul Patterson : Yeah. Okay. Great. And then with respect to the bill payment trends that people have been asking about, I'm sorry if I missed this, but in terms of not -- let's say technically what's uncollectible or bad debt or anything like that, but just in general at -- do you have any - if you, if you gave it, I apologize for missing it. But so just -- what the cadence has been in terms of people paying, let's say for April? Like for instance we're hearing, I saw one statistic that one-third of people didn\u2019t, this is nationwide, they didn't pay their rent for April that they were sort of late paying their April rent the first few weeks. Do you have any numbers sort of like that for what you're sort of experiencing there on the ground? Patti Poppe : Not yet, but we do know, we do have call volume from business and residential customers asking for a -- what we would call grace and extension of payment plans. And so, we are doing that. As we talk to these businesses, they typically have three big concerns. One is, rent as you described. Two is payroll. Three, is utilities. And so, we've been able to be a source of support to them and we feel comfortable extending those payment plans but that doesn't necessarily then translate into an uncollectable, particularly for our business customers and so -- and we've got some really good community action agencies and support resources for residential customers that can help them make their payments on time in the short run as well. So, I would suggest that our forecast isn't good yet. There's more to come and more to learn and certainly by Q2, we'll have a much better eye on, being able to quantify that. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then just finally on enterprises, the $0.04 benefit, and I apologize again if I just missed this, but what drove that? Patti Poppe : Rejji, you want to talk through the enterprise quarter? Rejji Hayes : Yeah, because -- so Paul, it was a combination of two things. So one, it was just the absence of an outage and Q1, so Filer City, did an outage last year. And so there was the absence of that and then just good cost performance at enterprises. And so that's really what drove the $0.04 positive variance. Paul Patterson : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Hang in there. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Gentlemen, this will conclude our question and answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Patti Poppe for any closing remark. Patti Poppe : Thank you, Allison. And again, thank you everyone for joining us today on our call. Please continue to stay safe and be well and you know, we really look forward to seeing you face to face when we can. We miss you all. Thanks so much. Operator : The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning everyone and welcome to the CMS Energy 2020 Second Quarter Results. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used on this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 p.m. Eastern Time running through August 10th. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Srikanth Maddipati : Thank you, Rocco. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I will turn the call over to Patti. Patricia Poppe : Thank you, Sri, and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call everyone it is great to be with you. This morning I will discuss our strong first half results and the actions we have taken to adapt to the challenges in the current year, while keeping an eye on delivering our long-term growth in 2021 and beyond. Rejji, will add more details on our financial results, including impacts related to COVID-19 and offsets we are seeing from the CE way among other items. And as always, we will close with Q&A. For the first half, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.35 up 25% from the same period in 2019. Our first half results were primarily driven by best-in-class cost management, favorable sales mix and timely regulatory recovery as we continue to respond to the ongoing and ever changing circumstances presented by COVID-19. As we have demonstrated through our commitment to the triple bottom line and the CE way, we can tackle unsurpassed extreme challenges, operationally and financially presented by this pandemic and its resulting economic impact. Given the better visibility we have on the pandemic and Michigan's economy reopening, we are pleased to reaffirm our adjusted guidance for the year of $2.64 to $2.68 with a bias to the midpoint. We continue to target long-term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. Again, with a bias to the midpoint. While ESG has been a more prominent topic recently. For us it is nothing new. Our long-term thesis is built and our commitment to the triple bottom line of people planet and profits underpinned by performance, which is our way of talking about and activating ESG in our decision making processes. It starts with people, of course, our co-workers, our customers and the communities that we serve. We continue to provide an essential service during these unpredictable times, while keeping our co-workers safe. Through smart work practices, including working-from-home, direct to job site reporting, social distancing, in our work locations and ensuring we have adequate testing and PPE. During this pandemic, the social awakening and the local flooding in Midland, Michigan. We have leveraged our foundation to support our customers and communities. Our ability to respond and deeply care for our coworkers and communities is made possible through the diverse team we have here at CMS Energy. We have maintained a strong commitment to diversity at CMS for many years. And this is reflected in the makeup of our Board and our Management team. But our work is far from complete, which is why I'm excited about our recent promotion of Angela Tompkins as our Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer. While all of us owns the efforts to improve Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at all levels. Angela's leadership will be vital for us now and in the future. Angela co-authored our DENI strategy in conjunction with the senior management team over the past several years. As a result of this focus, we were prepared for this time and the important conversations that are underway inside our company and nationwide. Our focus on the planet has not wavered. We have net zero plans for both our gas and electric businesses, which are among the most aggressive in the industry, both in terms of magnitude and timing. While our efforts in the future are ambitious, including over six gigawatts of added solar over the next 20-years, I would like to remind folks, we have already made an enormous amount of progress with the closure of our seven of our 12 coal plants, with the next two scheduled for closure in 2023. In addition to new renewable, we are replacing our retiring capacity with new and innovative solutions, such as our demand response program we ramped up this year, with our first of its kind partnership with Google to offer 100,000 Nest thermostats free to our customers. We believe in a clean and lean energy future and we plan to lead the way. All our efforts and success wouldn't be possible without the capital you provide. So that last piece for profit is always top of mind. As you can see in the numbers, and as we are highlighting for you this morning, our co-workers have been busy since we last updated you successfully identifying over $65 million of operating cost reductions since the pandemic began. In addition to a variety of year-over-year savings totaling $0.19 year to-date, and our foot is on the gas. Our lean operating system provides the ability to create reductions like these in the current year, and enable delivering in the years to come as the savings carry forward. And backed by popular demand, it is time for my story of the month. This one comes from our Jackson Generating Station where twice a year we replace couplings that helped maintain lubrication on each of the six gas engines there. So that is 12 replacements over the course of the year. Now, while this is often routine work, the team at the plant didn't just follow the routine. They brought their 18-years of on the job experience to the table and recommended an alternative coupling, which had the same performance and life expectancy but as a fraction of the cost. The team took ownership with the CE Ways as they propose this cost saving idea. This simple but important change lead over $30,000 of annual savings. Now, some of you may be saying Patti, come on $30,000 is not a lot of money. But what you forget is that there are thousands of stories like this across our company. And when you add up nickels and dimes, you get dollars in size. So I would like to give a shout out to my three co-workers who made this happen Ted, Dave and Bush thank you guys for taking full ownership of our Company's financial and operational targets, and delivering for all of our stakeholders. This is just one example of how our co-workers are feeling empowered to apply the CE Ways to their everyday work and ultimately improving performance throughout the whole company. The visual on Slide 6, my personal favorite serves as another reminder of our team's ability to adapt to deliver the financial results you have come to expect, regardless of the headwinds. 7% EPS growth every year is not an accident. We wrote the book on adapting to changing conditions and delivering results in the current year that enable next year success. Consistency is our Hallmark. And this year is no different. We continue to ride that roller coaster and it has been a wild ride so far this year, so that you can count on the predictable EPS and dividend growth you have come to expect. Looking to regulatory matters. Commissioner Dan Scripps was recently named Chair of the Public Service Commission here in Michigan. He has taken over for Commissioner Talberg, who is being considered for a new role at the Ercot Board beginning in January 2021. We want to thank Tally for her leadership and look forward to continuing to work with her through the remainder of her time on the Commission. We congratulate Dan Scripps as he transitions into his new role. We will remind you that the Commission ordered utilities to defer uncollectible accounts and track those expenses above what is currently approved in rates which speaks to our constructive regulatory environment here in Michigan. We are thankful to be able to work with the Commission to serve our customers in a caring way during this very uncertain time. We also have pending Gas and Electric rate cases and the MPFC staffs position in both demonstrate great alignment with our capital investment plan and rate base growth. We expect an order in our gas case in October and on our electric case by the end of the year. Thanks to low price commodities. Our cost saving capability and no big bets investment philosophy. We can both invest in safety, reliability and resilience of our infrastructure and protects customers from price spikes and surprises through tough economic times like these. The needs of our system do not change, because of a global pandemic and our customers' expectations don't either. Our business model allows us to serve both. Now turning to enterprises, where I'm pleased to highlight the measured growth of our contracted renewables business. As you may have seen last week, we acquired a majority ownership of a 525 megawatt contracted wind project. Construction of the project is largely complete and has an expected commercial online data set for later this month. The project will offer utility like returns and is largely committed to Facebook and McDonald's as customers. The bulk of the project is being financed with tax equity, and the remainder will be financed with cash-on-hand from our upsize hybrid offering and without the need to issue incremental equity beyond our plans $250 million this year. This project continues our track record of developing renewables for key corporate customers, while minimizing risk and providing attractive returns to complement our existing portfolio of assets, including DIG. Operator : As you are well aware, especially this year, conditions are always changing. Our entire team has demonstrated our ability to adapt for the good of the people we are privileged to serve. This agility has enabled us in the past and will enable us in the future to deliver consistent industry leading performance year after year after year. With that, I will turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Patti. And good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $139 million which translates to $0.49 per share. Our second quarter results were $0.16 above our Q2, 2019 results largely due to cost performance, favorable weather and rate relief net of investment related costs utility. Our non-utility business performed as expected. As EnerBank had increased origination volume and enterprises had planned outages at its [indiscernible] facilities. Our adjusted earnings for the quarter exclude select non-recurring items primarily related to severance and retention costs associated with the pending retirement of our coal facilities and expenses resulting from a voluntary co-worker separation program, both of which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2019. Year-to-date, we have delivered adjusted net income of $384 million or $1.35 per share up 25% from the same period in 2019 as Patty noted. All-round we are tracking as planned and navigating the impacts of the pandemic by delivering on cost reduction initiatives and planning conservatively. As highlighted during our first quarter call, we are closely monitoring our electric sales of the utility, which has historically been our most sensitive financial metric during economic downturns, particularly in the commercial industrial segments. At the end of April when we were in the initial stages of the pandemic, with extensive social distancing measures in place statewide, and most businesses closed, we experienced significant declines in our commercial, industrial normalized load, while residential load increase as people stay at home. I'm pleased to report that with a phase reopening of Michigan's economy over the past few months, C&I Electric sales have begun to recover, particularly in the higher margin commercial segment. And what we are witnessing in Michigan is that while businesses reopen they are maintaining high levels of mass tele-working, which drives power consumption at homes during business hours. So our residential sales have remained elevated while commercial industrial sales are starting to return to their pre-pandemic levels. Our normalized low trends for the quarter reflects some of this, we are even more encouraged by what we have observed in July, given the visibility afforded by our smart meter technology. The bar chart on the upper left hand side of Slide 11, highlights our year-to-date normalized load trends, which show total electric sales down about 5% exclusive of one large low margin customer. However, the aforementioned favorable sales mix has largely mitigated the year-to-date decline in normalized load. And I will remind you that every 1% change in residential sales equates to over $0.03 of EPS impact on a full-year basis. And our combined electric and gas customer contribution skews towards the residential segment. Our sales outlook for the full-year reflects a sustained level of favorable mix in residential sales up around year-to-date levels and with conservative assumptions around the recovery of the commercial industrial segments. Lastly, given that the Corona Virus is not yet fully contained. The low end of our sales outlook range incorporates a stress scenario, which assumes a second wave during the latter part of the year. Switching gears to EPS. You can see the key items impacting our financial performance relative to 2019 and our waterfall chart on Slide 12. If I could summarize in two words the key driver of our financial performance in the first half of 2020, it would be cost performance. As noted in the table on the left-hand side of the page, as Patty noted, we delivered $0.19 of positive variance versus 2019 by reducing operating and non-operating costs throughout the business, which more than offset the $0.07 of negative variance due to weather in the first half of the year, and the C&I sales degradation and emerging costs directly attributable to the pandemic. It is also worth noting that the levels of cost savings achieved and just the first half a year exceed previously referenced historical levels of cost performance over the past 10-years. As we step into the second half of the year, as always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case implies $0.07 of negative variance versus the prior year. We are also assuming a constructive outcome in our pending gas case, which equates to $0.02 per share of pickup. Lastly, we are ever mindful of a potential resurgence of the virus in Michigan, and other common sources of risk to our business such as mild weather and storms. As such, we are planning conservatively by continuing to deliver on our cost reduction initiatives to establish sufficient contingency to any of the aforementioned risks arise. You can see on the table on the right hand side of the page, RS into the potential EPS impacts of the forecasted sales range I referenced on the prior slide, which, as noted incorporates a potential second wave in Michigan, as well as additional expenses related to the pandemic, which we estimate at $0.09 per share in aggregate. To offset these potential cost and potential risks. We are on-track to deliver another $0.10 per share of cost savings, which is further supported by an additional $0.10 per share of weather related tailwinds that we have observed in our July electric sales. This Slide path provides good financial flexibility heading into the final five months of the year to mitigate risks that emerge in 2020, while beginning to de-risk 2021 and beyond through operational costs pull ahead and other means to the benefit of customers and investors. Now on the capital, our customer investment plan remains on-track for the year as we have continued to make progress on our numerous electric and gas supply and infrastructure projects, while keeping our co-workers safe, by adhering to the CDC guidelines. We are often asked whether we have seen disruptions in our supply chain for renewable projects and I'm pleased to report that we remain on-track on all fronts. In fact, our Gratiot and Hillsdale wind farm projects, which will collectively supply over 300-megawatts and help us meet Michigan 15% renewable standard by 2021 on course for commercial operation in 2020. Generally, we continue to make progress towards the 1100-megawatts of new solar supply through build transfer agreements and contracted solutions by 2024. As a reminder, this represents the first tranche of the 6000-megawatt program that Patti noted as approved in our integrated resource plan in June of last year. Longer term, our current plan calls for approximately 12 and a quarter billion dollars of customer investments over the next five-years, and supports rate based growth of 7% over that period. This capital plan reflects the continued monetization of our electric and gas infrastructure, as well as increase investments to de-carbonize our electric generation assets. We will also remind you there a five-year customer investment plan is not limited by the needs of our system, but instead buy balance sheet constraints, workforce capacity and customer affordability. To elaborate on the point around customer affordability as we work toward delivering on cost reduction initiatives in 2020. Our bias remains toward projects that deliver sustainable savings to create long-term headroom and customer bills. As you will note on Slide 14, our $5.5 billion cost structure offers ample opportunities to reduce costs through the exploration of high price PPAs. the retirement of our full fleet capital enabled savings as we modernize our electric and gas distribution systems, and the continued maturation of the CE Way. The long-term headroom created in our electric and gas bills by these efforts will support our substantial customer investment needs of the utility to the benefit of customers and investors. You can see the long-term effects of our historical cost reduction efforts in the chart on the right hand side of the slide, which illustrates how we have managed to keep customer bills low on an absolute basis and relative to other household staples in Michigan law investing over $17 billion of capital over that timeframe. As I have said in the past, paying $5 to $6 per day, for clean, safe and reliable electricity natural gas is an extraordinary value proposition due in no small part to our cost discipline and triple bottom line mindset. Switching gears to our financing plan, we are quite active in the second quarter, opportunistically tapping the market to complete the vast majority of our planned financings for the year. From an equity financing perspective we announced our Q4 call, our plan to issue up to $250 million of equity all of which is priced under existing equity for contracts. And we exercise $100 million of that capacity late March with the remaining $150 million tranche still outstanding. We also filed a perspective supplement during the quarter for $500 million to refresh our ATM program, which is intended to cover our equity needs over the next three years. All of our financings have been executed at terms favorable to our plan, which offer entry year savings and help de-risk the future. We have also maintained a healthy bias toward liquidity management, with over $3 billion of net liquidity available in the event the capital markets become choppy again. As we look ahead, we will continue to maintain flexibility and capitalize on accommodative market conditions when they emerge. And with that, I will pass it back to Patti for some closing remarks before we open up the lines for Q&A. Patricia Poppe : Thanks, Rejji. Our team is committed to delivering for customers and you, our investors. The capital you provide is critical and our long-term track record of managing that capital speaks to that commitment. We remain good stewards of our balance sheet with prudent planning and already this year we have executed financings at attractive rates that enable us to fund our capital programs. We continue to rely on the CE Way and lean into their lean operating system we have in place. And as a result, we improve both our cost structure and our customer experience each and every day. Michigan continues to remain a top tier regulatory jurisdiction with forward looking test years and 10-month rate cases, we are fortunate to have much constructive regulatory framework in statute. Our system remains in great need of replacements and upgrades that won't go away as a result of the current pandemic. We are fortunate that our plans have embedded structural cost reductions in the form of retiring coal plants and PPAs retiring. None of this comes at a price to our planet, and our home state of Michigan. Our net zero carbon and methane plans remain as important today as the day we establish them. Our model holds together well and that is why the thesis remains strong. And that is why we can rely on our triple bottom line to get us through this ongoing pandemic, just as it has in the past and will do in the future. With that Rocco, will you please open the lines for Q&A? Operator : Thank you very much, Patti. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. James Thalacker : Good morning, guys. How are you? Patricia Poppe : Great. Good morning to you. Rejji Hayes : Hey, James. James Thalacker : Just real quick follow-up. Maybe this one is for you, Rejji. Clearly July has been hot and you have actually had the benefit of the mix with revenue continuing to be very, very strong, commercials kind of trending on the on the lower end of where your forecast was. But industrial is kind of on the higher end. As you as you think about sort of the full-year, it seems like those things have kind of bounced out and kind of kept in check, as you have pushed cost savings through but, Rejji mentioned kind of sort of maybe we see a double dip on COVID as we go into the back half of the year. How are you thinking about those sales forecasts, as we think about the second half, in case we do have sort of a resurgence in the virus? Rejji Hayes : Yes, James, good question. So, we did take that into account. And so I will point you to Slide 11, where we show the downside range embedded in our full-year forecast in the lower left hand corner of the page. And so you can see we are taking into account a potential second dip and a stress scenario and so that shows commercial backing up to around 12% on full-year basis, which obviously means that the latter two quarters will be quite bad. And then you can see industrial at 18%, again on the low end. And that excludes one large low margin customer, which would even make that number a little lower. And so we are taking that into account. And I will also point you to the next slide, Slide 12, we estimate what that margin impact will be at $0.07 of EPS dilution. We are also mindful of the potential emerging costs that may come around if there is a second dip. And so we are taking into account quarantine related expenses, potential sequestration related costs and we think that that is probably another $0.02. And so all in we think there is about $0.09 of EPS related delusion in the event, there is a double death. And so when we look at July sales based on our smart meter data coupled with our cost savings that we feel very good about achieving over the second half of the year, we feel like we have sufficient cushion to stomach that downside case. Now obviously, it is a pandemic and so you this is unprecedented, but we feel good about the road ahead just based on our current calibrations. James Thalacker : Okay, great. Thanks for pointing that out. I appreciate it. Congratulations on a great quarter. Rejji Hayes : Thanks. Operator : Our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. Patricia Poppe : Good morning, Jonathan. Rejji Hayes : Hey. Jonathan Arnold : Rejji could I just ask you, if you can give us a little bit more of a sense of the sort of trajectory that you have seen on the sales in different classes. You are obviously showing us here today. We have the second quarter and the release. And then you made some comments about July, sort of trending better, I think, before we talk about the weather, but just a feel for kind of how you maybe the sort of latter part of this period is looking relative to the Q2 average? Rejji Hayes : Yes, sure. I would say it is been a very nice progression. If you think about the months in Q2, obviously April, I would say represented the bottom bottoming out. And so as we highlighted in our Q1 call where we had pretty good visibility on April, we were down about 20% to 25%. And then as we progressed into May and June, we saw a very nice progression as the state reopened. And so first you had the industrial sector start to come back around mid-May, and then non-essential retail shortly thereafter. And so with the graduate reopening of the state, we are now seeing C&I levels really come in. And so to give you a data point, for June for commercial, we were about 9% down. And we were basically 20% to 25% down in April. So, there is been a nice recovery and the July trends at this point, it is early days, and so I really try not to overreact to Smart Meter data, but we are looking at about 90% to 95% of pre-pandemic levels for our commercial industrial sales. And so there is been a very nice, gradual recovery month-over-month, over the course of Q2 and now into July. So we are cautiously optimistic. And you can see that reflected in the full-year forecast. But needless to say, we plan conservatively. And so in the event, there is a double dip, twin peak, whatever you want to call it. We are going to make sure we have enough cost savings and other sources of contingency to mitigate that risk. Is that helpful, Jonathan? Jonathan Arnold : That is great. Thank you for that. And then just on - there was a number mentioned $65 million on cost saving. And I heard it was Patti's prepared remarks that was incremental to what you delivered in the first half, but could you just tie that 65 back to what you showing on Slide 12 for example. Where is that? Patricia Poppe : Yes, Jonathan that is embedded in $0.19 year-to-date savings. But part of the $65 million will carry through and be realized as the year progresses. So there really is sort of apples and oranges. But let me be clear about a couple things. $55 million is definitely not the finish line. And again, as you have noted, it doesn't reflect all of the year-over-year savings year-to-date. The team's identified $65 million in operational cost reductions so far this year. And so when we add in other year-over-year additional non-operational savings, that is again, what Rejji's point about $0.19 year-to-date. But again, that is not the full-year number. And it is a little bit apples and oranges. But one of the things to remind you is that, our best ever performance was $0.15 for a full-year. We talked about that in Q1. And so you can see why we are so proud of this team. And why I'm glad that we started preparing for this year four years ago when we launched the CE Ways. You can't make a friend when you need one. And it takes time. And so I'm grateful that we are launching a cost savings program this year. We are relying on our friends, the CE Ways, and she is delivering record levels this year right on time. So, I would be happy to give some additional color to that. But just like the story of the month, that literally is happening all over the company. And it is been four years in the making so proud of the team. Jonathan Arnold : Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Congratulations on continued success as you say on CE Ways. But if I can perhaps start with the last question left off? Can you talk about how much contingency you have left in your program? Obviously, I imagine and even prepared for a second quarter results, the way that the July weather has trended already has shifted to meet and your overall expectations for contingency even relative to the $0.10 that you were after the back half of the year. So can you talk about how this even positions you in the 2021 based on what even you are disclosing here if that is a fair way to ask the question as well. Patricia Poppe : Yes, it is a great question, Julian, because we are thinking about it all the time. Rejji talked about the $0.10. And so that is sort of in our pocket in the event of greater risk as the year progresses, but we are always redeploying cost savings back into the business. So it is never a question of what is sustainable for us or whether we are constantly finding those savings. We are constantly eliminating waste and then we redeploying those savings as needed. What is cool about these smaller savings and the way we do it is it gives us optionality. We will improve the number of miles trimmed for example per dollar or reduce the cost per visit service replaced. But then if we can trim more trees or replaced more services we will whether that is in the current year, because we have got favorability or in the future year because in fact, we pull ahead work. So, we have got $0.19 year-over-year cost savings or about $75 million, which again, that is not an accident. We are in the process of planning for 2021. But the key is like every year, we maintain a significant amount of flexibility to manage our business to meet both the commitments to customers. And to you, our investors and great analysts like Julian, you know we ride this roller coaster so that no one else has to. Everyone else, all of you get to toe on those consistent, predictable outcomes because we are making those choices year-in and year-out. So, now when we look at what we have achieved year-to-date and expect for the rest of the year. Quite a bit of that can carry over into next year. But again, we always fine tune and in a particular year we aligned the plan also to our what is in rates. So, we are just continuing to conclude our rate cases which we will be able to align with our approved plans, and then our cost savings can be deployed as required. Is that helpful? Julien Dumoulin Smith : Absolutely, thank you. If I can pivot a little bit more to the strategic question here, obviously, you guys are getting deeper into the contracted win signed outside of rate base. Can you speak a little bit more to how you see that business evolving in capital commitments within that, and maybe if I can ask it this way. How do you think about that as a percent of the total growth overtime. Is it six to eight or just really kind of supplementary complimentary however you want to think it or frame it, curious, just given how large this initial investment is on the platform? Patricia Poppe : Great question, Julian. I will start and then I will let Reggie add some more of additional details. The key criteria for us as we look at these opportunities. They are always opportunistic, given the market conditions, given the demands, we need to make sure that three things are true. Number one, that they are customer driven. We aren't doing one-off auctions to acquire assets. We are not way back in the development phases of projects. We are working with customers to have a repeatable business. And so for the example of Aviator wasn't an option. We knew the developer and these customers have a desire to grow their renewable energy and we are in a great position to further those needs. It is a key component of the planet part of our triple bottom line. Number two, they have to had utility like or better returns, our utility business has a lot of demands for capital, it is got a lot of opportunity for growth. So, a project like Aviator has to compete with other utility projects. Given that the bulk of our growth for the company is driven by the utility. These projects have to be really good for them to get a yes from us here. Number three, they need to not add risk to the consolidated business. So, this project, for example, has two high quality credit worthy off takers. You saw in the press release McDonald's and Facebook, the term of the PPAs are greater than 10-years. So, that is a good example of an opportunistic project that came to us, because we have got a reputation of being able to close the deal and operate it well. And when it meets that criteria, then we continue looking at it. And so when we think, though about the long-term growth of the company to your question about the role it plays in six to eight, the enterprises business plays about a 5% of our earnings now. We don't expect to have n-regulated growth beyond that 10% of our total Company portfolio. So, the bulk of our growth is utilities. That is our bread and butter. That is what we focus the bulk of our time on. But where enterprises can grow with the utility doing what we do well, which is operate renewable projects and we serve customers well, then it is a nice compliment to the - and a portion a - piece of that 6% to 8%. Rejji Hayes : Yes, Julian, the only thing I would add to Patti's good comments. Patti mentioned in her prepared remarks that there was a slug of tax equity. And that was not an insufficient slug. And so, if you look just on the surface and see 525 megawatts and then apply what you think is the standard cost per kilowatt, you can think the investment is quite sizable, but again, there is a pretty material slog of tax equity. And we are also a joint owner of the common equity for lack of a better characterization. And so, this really is not all that significant and investment from our perspective. In fact, it is quite comparable to the size investment we did for Northwest Ohio a year and a half ago. And so, we are being as Patti noted, opportunistic. We are trying to hit singles and doubles here. We are not swinging into fences. And so, we will approach this as the type of business where again it can be I think here where it is complimentary or supplement our portfolio, but again, we are not triples in homerun here. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Fair enough. I will leave it there. Thank you. Patricia Poppe : Thanks, Julian. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Patricia Poppe : Good morning Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Thanks. Good morning everyone. I wanted ask a little bit more about the financing year-to-date in Page 15. It looks like you are well ahead of the initial plan. And a lot of that seems like it was done since the 1Q call. So wasn't purely reaction to your uncertainties around COVID I'm sure. Can you just walk us through why you were so aggressive with the debt, what your plans are for those term loans and how you think about the liquidity at over $3 billion. Rejji Hayes : Yes. So, Andrew, I will take the last part of your question first. I mean, at the end of the day we do not intend to have a bunch of lazy capital sitting on our balance sheet. And so we fully expect the $3 billion to come down quite a bit by the end of the year. But again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we are biasing towards liquidity management because the viruses and get contained. And so in the event, there is increased or continued volatility in the capital market, we want to just make sure we have sufficient liquidity. Now, as you think about the components on page 15. You can see from a first mortgage bond perspective at the OPCO, we are well in excess of what we hadn't planned at $1.2 billion But I will just note that there are a couple of maturities that we are dressing that will make those numbers look a bit more normalized. And so we have a term loan that you can see that we have yet to repay again, in the interest of just erring on the side of extra liquidity, particularly given the relatively low cost. And so that is a $300 million term loan. We also pulled forward a maturity at the OPCO in 2022 that had a five handle and so a very nice bit a positive carry in that trade. And so you take the two of those together that year-to-date, first mortgage bond issue to-date looks much more normalized relative to what we have in plan. And again, thinking about that same logic at the HoldCo. We did the hybrid, which is a lot higher than what we anticipated. But that is again, we have some flexibility in prepaying a term loan before it comes due or as it comes due. So I wouldn't overreact. We have just been opportunistic and really, again, erring on the side of liquidity. But again by the end of the year, I would be surprised if we were at that level of excess liquidity again by year in particular given the capital needs we have at the utility. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great, that is helpful. Next, just to be very clear, on page 12, the waterfall for the six months ago. That risk and opportunity box, obviously you are showing somewhere between $0.02 and $0.09 of negatives versus $0.20 of positives. That I believe the minus $0.07 to minus $0.03 you have for cost savings usage and other. Am I reading this right that you are basically saying that negative is kind of what you are expecting from COVID, but you have $0.10 of additional cost offset and $0.10 of July, whether that should help you out. And if that is the case, if nothing else changes, would you be able to reinvest those $0.20 by year-end? Rejji Hayes : Yes, so the quick answer is we feel quite good about the contingency that we have expect to have accumulate over the - particularly when you take July weather. So, you have effectively some excess contingency based on the numbers we are seeing. What I will note that just for full clarity is that cost savings as you can see - there is a lot more than just the items we have enumerated in that table. And so it is a hodgepodge of things. But we just highlighted here what we think is most noteworthy. And again we have taken into account in this math in the table, a stress scenario which obviously is in our base case, what we are seeing even in the event that we start to see margin erosion for commercial industrial like we on Page 11 - we still think that couples with cost that both could come again, if you have a second wave, we feel like we have generated and will generate enough cost savings, as well as with the July weather where we have sufficient contingency. But, Patti, if you would like to add to that, by all means, Patricia Poppe : Well, I will just get to the latter half of your question, Andrew. We expect that we will be able to redeploy funds this year, for the benefit of customers, and we are always planning for next year. So, we just want to make sure that we always and we have great capability to deploy those funds as required and pull ahead expenses and so we have got ample time between now and year end to make those adjustments. And we have had some success with some regulatory treatment, near year end where we can push forward some programs and some benefits for customers into future years. And so we really think that there is a good opportunity for us to leverage any favorability that we would have this year to serve customers and investors. Andrew Weisel : Good positioned to be and I'm sure your trees will be well trimmed by year-end? Patricia Poppe : Our customers love that and so do we. Andrew Weisel : Great. One last one if I can on the rate cases, your neighbors in Michigan recently settled their natural gas case and differ the electric case by a year. I know that no two utilities or rate cases are the same. But do you see potential for something similar for your rate cases? Are there certain factors that may preclude taking actions like this? Patricia Poppe : You know it is a creative option leveraging those deferred income taxes and so certainly would be open to considering it. We will keep looking at it. We have got good alignment with the staff on both our electric and our gas cases they are both in flight as we speak. And so we would look at it. But I will remind you that we don't object to annual filings for two reasons. Number one, it allows us to flex the Capital Planning, all of our rate cases are forward looking. And so as needs of the system change, as conditions emerge and because we don't have a big bet capital plan, we can modify our plan on manual basis to best reflect the greatest needs for customers. And so that is important to us. But I would also say that our rate cases are also opportunities to pass on cost savings to customers. And so when we think about the last seven years, for example, we have invested $15 billion of capital and our electric bills are down 5% and our gas bills are down 30%. I mean, that is the math that backs-up our business model that says, we can invest capital, particularly capital that saves customers money in the transition to cleaner energy and the reduction of these large PPAs that are coming forward. Skipping rate cases actually prevents us from passing along savings to customers. So we certainly are taking a look at the deferred income tax and perhaps delaying a case, but it isn't necessary for us to protect the affordability for our customers. Andrew Weisel : Great. Thank you so much. Patricia Poppe : Yes. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Patricia Poppe : Good morning Shar. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. It is actually [Indiscernible] here for Shar. Congrats on great quarter. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Unidentified Analyst : A lot of questions have been already answered. And it has been very comprehensive. But just going back to the Aviator project. Just wanted to kind of get some thoughts on kind of given that the decoration was prompted kind of relatively outside of plan I guess. Does that imply returns above utility ROE. And part of this acquisition said within the current CapEx plan. Rejji Hayes : Yes, so I can tell you the [Indiscernible] and thanks for the question. So as Patti noted, I think we evaluate all these projects, when we are looking at capital allocation across the company. Because it is quite competitive internally. We make sure that the returns are comparable to those of the utility if not better. And so we feel quite good about the economic profile of this project. And again, as Patti noted, we also want to make sure that we are not ascribing a lot of terminal value to these types of projects. And that there is very good credit worthy uptick. And we feel like this project checks those boxes. Now, we do not conflate utility capital investments with these types of projects in the $2.25 billion that we highlighted in our Q4 2019 call. We are still on-track to deliver that. And this is again opportunistic, it is not changing our financing plan, as Patti noted. And so, we feel like this is a nice opportunity to take advantage of. It is not a triple or a homerun, it is a single or double and this aligns with how we would like to evaluate and take on projects like this going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hi, guys. Patricia Poppe : Hi Mike. Rejji Hayes : Hey Mike. Michael Weinstein : A lot of my questions were answered. But wanted to get on Slide 21. Just the NOLs and credits that are increasing overtime that because you have more renewable projects that you are expecting to bring in overtime, or is that just from the existing project portfolio? Rejji Hayes : Yes, it is more to form. I mean, we have always had a good balance of NOLs and credits. But we do see a little bit of accretion in that balance because of some of the renewables we expect. So that is larger, but that is Michael. Michael Weinstein : So I mean, that would imply that you are probably not going to have much of a tax appetite and you would probably have to continue using tax equity as you invest in these renewables. Rejji Hayes : Yes, where we sit at this point, we don't expect to be really a meaningful federal taxpayer until around 2024. And so our sense is that tax equity will likely be this financing vehicle for some time. Michael Weinstein : And is it possible, could you give us a sense of the cost that you are seeing for it out there? Where is the cost of capital. Rejji Hayes : Yes, I will say it is attractive. as you know obviously, it is not as cheap as a debt - plain or common debt financing. But also, it is not as expensive as traditional common equity. And so it is in between and we think the rates that we have negotiated for this particular transaction are quite competitive. Michael Weinstein : And so I mean you are not seeing for instance, a decline in investor appetite due to the lower tax rates? Rejji Hayes : No. like I said this a pretty meaningful slug of tax equity that is been in this project and for other projects that we evaluate from time-to-time. We haven't seen any contraction in the market for tax equity, but we will see. I mean, obviously, if there is another bit of volatility in the market, because there is a double dip or twin peak, whatever you want to call it, now market may back up for now, it is been quite accommodative. Michael Weinstein : Okay. And one last question. I mean, with the increase in NOLs that you have - in tax credits are in that on Slide 21. How many more projects do you think that sort of implies by 2024? Rejji Hayes : Yes, I wouldn't say it is that, I wouldn't say our financial planning is that prescriptive. Again, we intend to be opportunistic on these types of projects. And so we are assuming I think, a modest level of additional project flow and that is where you see again a modest bit of credit accretion. So again, we are not swinging for the fences here and assuming that there is going to be material increase in our NOLs or our credit specifically because of projects like this. Michael Weinstein : Got you. Alright, thanks a lot, Rejji. Thanks a lot Patti. Patricia Poppe : Thanks, Michael. Operator : And our question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good morning. Patricia Poppe : Hey. Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Yes. Good morning. Just one question for me here. With the bank side, just wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more color on how things shaped up the second quarter relative to your expectations there and just general thoughts and trends to the balance of the year on the bank side would be helpful? Rejji Hayes : Sure. I think the quick answer is the bank is on-track. And so we have got it to $0.18 to $0.20 for the full-year and they are on course to deliver that. Now, you will see for the quarter, and for the period-over-period comp, they were behind by about a penny that was per plan, because they started the year quite well. And obviously we have implemented the new accounting standard current expected credit losses and so that has a material impact on the provision for loan losses. And so when you comp it to 2019 you may see in the third quarter a little bit of leakage quarter-over-quarter. But we are fully on-track we have continued to see very good origination volume across most of the projects that we provide financing for and I think June was a historical month of loan approvals and loan originations. And so we are trending on plan and really haven't seen much backup, but for I would say April to for a little period of time. Jeremy Tonet : That is very helpful. Thank you for taking my question. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Patricia Poppe : Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : And our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller : Good morning, everyone. Rejji Hayes : Hey Travis. Travis Miller : Not to be laver this here, but going back to Slide 12, again, and just want to triple check, I'm understanding. So the $0.19 you have saved so far this year, and then going over to the right side of the $0.10. Are those the same number such that when you talk about redeploying operating costs or anything other - any other savings that the $0.19 done for the muted $0.10 for the full-year, or is there something else going on I\u2019m not understanding? Rejji Hayes : Yes, so just to be clear, Travis, so in the first half of the year, that $0.19, remember that is a comp relative to 2019. And so you have a few things flowing through that from non-operating savings, you can see some flex and work optimization. The $0.10 that you see on the right hand side that aligns with the 65 million that Patti noted or released a good portion of it that we have identified and realize to-date, and so that is what you see in the year to go is really the vast majority of the 65 million of operating cost savings that we have delivered through the CE Way. So, the lean operating system, supply chain, a little bit of work mix that was favorable as we take own resources over to capital projects, particularly during the shoulder months, and we were quite effective at that. And so that $0.10 is largely the 65 million again that Patti noted in her prepared remarks. Travis Miller : Okay. Very good. And is there a scenario where if you continue to have the favorable weather, then you could actually have that number come down such that you pull ahead or cost than you might have incurred in 2021or 2022, as you have in the past years. Patricia Poppe : Yes, that is great. That is right Travis. We definitely pull ahead those savings and when we can prepare for 2021. And so to get really specific $0.19 plus the $0.10 that is all opportunity. And so when you look at our Slide 6, which is what I sometimes refer to as the swish-swish slide, it is the roller coaster slide. We will, as the year materializes have options about how to deploy those savings, whether they are to the benefit of this year or to the benefit of 2021 and 2022. So we are definitely in forward planning right now for next year on how best to de-risk 2021 with the upside that we have identified through these cost savings. Travis Miller : Okay, great. I appreciate. That is all I had. Patricia Poppe : Yes, thanks. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey guys. Good morning. A lot of discussion. I just have one question. Going back to these O&M savings. How should we think about how are they handled in your ongoing rate cases? Are there - so Patti you mentioned 2021. So as we think about 2021, should we assume that this will be reflected in your rate plans? In other words, some of this or most of this goes back to the customers, how you sort of dealing with that in your ongoing rate cases? Patricia Poppe : Yes. Because we have forward looking ratemaking we always align our rates in our O&M. So, internally when our rate cases approved, then we align the spending to match it. And so when we have favorability or we have cost savings that are in addition to what is in a rate case in year, then in that current year we may have a short-term benefit of that. But that is why we will take those short-term benefits and reinvest them, for example, trim more trees or do more maintenance or pull ahead some expenses from next year. But we are always because of that forward-looking test year, we really are able to align our spending and our rate outcomes. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. I appreciate it guys. Great quarter. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Patricia Poppe : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this includes the question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Patti Poppe for final remarks. Patricia Poppe : Thank you, Rocco. Great to be with everyone today. Thanks so much for tuning in. And please be safe and be well. I hope you and your families are able to come together and be healthy during this very challenging time. We do look forward to seeing you face-to-face someday we can't wait and we miss you all. Thanks so much for tuning in. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. And thank you everyone for their participation. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning everyone and welcome to the CMS Energy 2020 Third Quarter Results. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 p.m. Eastern Time running through November 5th. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Srikanth Maddipati : Thank you, Rocco. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I will turn the call over to Patti. Patricia Poppe : Thank you, Sri, and good morning everyone. We hope you\u2019re all doing well and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. This morning I\u2019ll share our financial results and outlook for the first nine months of the year. I\u2019ll also introduce our 2021 guidance, review our catalogue plan which supports our de-carbonization efforts and I\u2019ll touch briefly on our regulatory calendar. Rejji will add more details on our financial results and as always we will call for Q&A. We\u2019re happy to report that for the first nine months of the year, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.11, up 17% from the same period in 2019. Our year-to-date results were driven by our team\u2019s best-in-class cost management through the CE way. Given the risk mitigation in place for this year and our visibility into next year, we\u2019re pleased to reaffirm our adjusted guidance for the year of $2.64 to $2.68 with a bias to the midpoint and introduce our adjusted guidance for 2021 of $2.82 to $2.86, up, you guessed it 6% to 8% from the midpoint of our current guidance range. We continue to target long-term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%, again with a bias to the midpoint, which I\u2019ll remind you reflects both consistent and industry leading growth. We remain grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom-line of people, planet and profit. We\u2019re committed to diversity, equity and inclusion and are doubling our spend on diversifiers over the next five years after having tripled our spend over the last seven. Just last month, the Governor of Michigan announced the State\u2019s goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 which supports our clean energy plan and all the actions we\u2019ve already taken to protect our planet and reduce our carbon footprint. And before moving on, I want to highlight we\u2019re over $100 million in cost reductions realized year-to-date through the CE way. This is a true testament to the maturity of our CE way mindset and just what this team is capable of when called to action. My quick story of the month is from our team at Filer City generating station, who identified a shorter route throughout the building to perform operator rounds. This eliminated over one hour or 2,500 steps on each shift. The annual mileage savings are equivalent to the distance from the southern border of our state all the way to Mackinac Bridge. Now that\u2019s [indiscernible] about. Step-by-step, minute-by-minute, dollar-by-dollar it all heads up to the CE way. Our team has proven that we can put the pedal to the medal on cost performance to deliver the required results now and in the future. Our commitment to the triple bottom-line chime through in our capital investment plan that focuses on enhancing the safety and reliability of our system while keeping customer bills affordable, protecting our planet and delivering for our customers and investors as we move toward net zero. We benefit from a regulatory constructed Michigan and a statue that allows for the financial incentives above and beyond our current authorized ROE. These include a 20% return on our energy efficiency spend as we help customers reduce energy waste and lower their monthly bills. A financial mechanism equal to our weighted average cost of capital on new renewable PPAs and a premium ROE of 10.7% on renewable investments to meet our 15% renewable portfolio standard in Michigan. All of which illustrates that we can deliver reliably on the triple bottom-line what\u2019s good for our people and the planet can also deliver top tier profits. It\u2019s no wonder we\u2019re considered a leader in ESG. By 2024, we will have added 1,100 megawatts of solar to our system on top of 1 gigawatt of RPS renewables since 2011. Our clean energy plan calls for a total of 6 gigawatts of solar additions to our system or $3 billion to $6 billion of investment opportunities through 2040. As we move forward and file our next IRP in 2021, we will look to realize some of this opportunity and pulled into our plan as utility scale renewables continue to make triple bottom-line sense. Our commitment to serving all our stakeholders has not gone unnoticed. We\u2019ve been recognized nationwide for our good efforts and slide 7 celebrates that recognition, including that as of 2019, CMS Energy received an MSCI ESG rating of AA. Moving onto our regulatory calendar. We settled our gas rate case last month and agreed not to file another gas rate case before December of 2021. We expect an order in our electric rate case and an outcome on our securitization filing by the end of this year. Following that we will not have any general rate case decisions impacting our 2021 earnings which provide further visibility and economic certainty throughout next year. Turning to my favorite slide, slide 9 reminds you of how we manage the work intra year to mitigate risk in future years and deliver the financial results you\u2019ve come to expect. So in a year like this year when we\u2019ve seen an enormous amount of headwinds, our team hunkered down and exercised our lean operations to find and eliminate waste at every level. To-date we\u2019ve realized over a $100 million in saving through these efforts and I\u2019m so very proud of all my co-workers for demonstrating world-class cost performance and enabling us to deliver savings through the CE way so that we can continue to deliver a world-class customer experience and consistent industry leading financial performance. Now, you might be wondering if that $100 million of savings would make us deviate from our bias toward the midpoint of the guidance range. It does not. We\u2019re sitting in the driver seat as we put the pilot savings to work for 2021 and 2022 and begin to de-risk those years. It is precisely this cost discipline which rollercoaster for you and instead delivers the consistent top tier annual growth rate every year, not just the easy ones. 7% year after year after year. We wrote the book on adapting to changing conditions and delivering results in the current year that enable next year success and the year after that. We ride the rollercoaster so that you can count on the predictable EPS and dividend growth you expect. And now I\u2019ll hand the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you Patti and good morning everyone. In the third quarter we delivered adjusted net income of $221 million which translates to $0.77 per share. Our third quarter results were $0.04 above our third quarter 2019 results largely due to cost performance, constructive regulatory outcomes and favorable weather at the utility. It is worth noting that our adjusted earnings for the quarter excludes non-recurring items primarily related to retention cost associated with the pending retirement of our current coal facilities which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2019. Year-to-date we\u2019ve delivered adjusted net income of $605 million or $2.11 per share, up 17% from the same period in 2019. As Patti noted, we\u2019re trending well in large part due to our company wide efforts in cost reduction largely driven by the CE way. As you know, we continue to monitor our electric sales and utility closely given that the pandemic is not yet fully contained and we remain encouraged with the trends we observed across each customer class over the course of 2020. On slide 11, you will see that weather normalized electric sales were up roughly half of a percent for the quarter versus the third quarter of 2019 with the residential segment continuing to lead the way up 6% for the quarter versus the comparable period in 2019. The commercial and industrial segments continue to recover down 4% and 3.5% respectively versus the prior year, which aligns well with the phase reopening of Michigan's economy. As noted in the past the weather normalized industrial and total electric sales I just quoted, exclude the effects of one large low margin customer. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter in 2021, we're cautiously optimistic about the normalized trends we've seen so far in 2020 with normalized load for the residential segment continuing to outperform expectations, which I'll remind you offers a higher margin than those of our commercial industrial segments and has historically represented over 60% of our customer contribution. Turning to our waterfall chart on slide 12, you can see the current and expected drivers of our year-over-year financial performance. As mentioned, cost performance continues to be a key factor to our financial results for 2020 and as Patti noted we have delivered over $100 million of savings to date, the vast majority of which is represented in the $0.28 per share of cost savings highlighted in the table on the left hand side of the page and more than offsets the pandemic related expenses incurred to-date and mild weather experience in the first quarter. Rate relief net investments and less storm activity relative to the comparable period in 2019 provided $0.13 and $0.05 per share of positive variance respectively in the first nine months of the year. With three months to go in 2020, we'll plan for normal weather as we always do, which implies $0.02 per share of negative variance versus the prior year and is more than offset by the constructive outcome we achieved in our gas rate case settlement which equates to $0.07 per share of pickup in the fourth quarter. Needless to say we will remain paranoid by maintaining sufficient contingency to mitigate the inherent risk to our business such as weather and storms as well as a potential resurgence of virus in Michigan and will concurrently reinvest any estimated excess contingency to provide near and long-term value to our customers, co-workers and investors. As we look out longer term even with our significant success reducing costs in 2020 and in years prior there are still ample opportunities to reduce costs to create headroom in customer bills for future capital investments. As a reminder, the expiration of our large PPAs and the retirement of our coal fleet offer sustainable cost reduction opportunities over the next several years. We'll also realize capital enabled savings as we modernize our electric and gas distribution systems and will continue to reap the benefits of the ongoing maturation of the CE way. You can see the long-term effects of our historical cost reduction efforts in the chart on the right-hand side of slide 13, which highlights that we've kept customer bills low on an absolute basis and relative to other household staples in Michigan from 2007 to 2019 while investing roughly $19 billion of capital in our gas and electric systems over that timeframe. In fact, in 2019 our utility bills made up approximately 3% of household expenditures in Michigan, down a 4 percentage point from the 2007 level. We're often asked whether we can sustain our consistent industry-leading growth in the long-term given the widespread concerns about economic conditions or potential changes in fiscal, energy and/or environmental policy. You name the risk and I can assure you we've heard it before. Well, the reality is that change is the one constant that you can count on in this business and we'll continue to adapt to the inherent risks and other external factors that may impact our business and still deliver for our customers, co-workers, the planet and our investors as we have for almost two decades now as illustrated on page 14. And with that I'll pass it back to Patti for some closing remarks before we open up the lines for Q&A. Patricia Poppe : Thanks Rejji. Simply this, our model holds together well and that's why this thesis remains strong. With that Rocco please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Patricia Poppe : Good morning Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : I just want to start off, if you might be able to provide us some thoughts on what the next IRP filing could look like and any more color if you see opportunities to further accelerate coal retirement, integrate renewables more and include storage as part of the resource mix there? Patricia Poppe : Yes Jeremy, great question. We are excited about our next filing of IRP which will be made a year 2021. We're still in the modeling phase. So no early read just yet. So I will say we're hopeful that an outer years in particular in our first filing we had about 450 megawatts of storage. I would love to see more storage in the outer years. We were requested in our settlement and agreed to study earlier requirements of some of the other coal plants, but right now our plan remains the same, but certainly when we know will let you know and we're excited about the potential that new IRP and what it offers to benefit the planet and the cost structure and our customers. It's really a great time in this business. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Makes sense. Thanks for that and then separately just wondering if you could provide a bit more detail on the benefit that a 6% uptick and residential sales has had on the electric margins and really just, with this increased residential skew and cost for mix and sales and the cost cuts you've achieved so far just wondering how we should think about that and how that might impact the upcoming rate filing? Rejji Hayes : Yes Jeremy. We talked about in the past the impact that the residential segment has in our electric business and so the general \u2013 you\u2019re thinking about the annual impact is 1% change and residential equates to $0.03 of EPS accretion and that's symmetric so up or down. And for industrial and other side it's about half a penny for 1% change commercial rule close to residential. So it does have a pretty good impact and as you think about the road ahead I'll just remind you the electric case that we have pending that has a 4 test here which reflects all of 2021 and so we are contemplating a subsequent file of this electric rates case and so that will obviously have an impact on 2022. But if we continue to see a trend like we've seen over the course of this year, it could provide a potential tailwind in 2022, but we're still at obviously the early stages of our planning process for 2021. But I'd say the electric rate cases that\u2019s pending, the order on that will obviously dictate a lot of our economics going in 2021 in the existing gap settlement that we've already got provides a lot of economics going into 2021. Does that address your question? Jeremy Tonet : Yes, that's very helpful. Thanks for taking my question. Patricia Poppe : Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : Next question today comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse, please go ahead. Patricia Poppe : Good morning Michael. Operator : Michael your line is on mute perhaps. Michael Weinstein : Okay. Sorry about that. Here I am. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on whether you might be considering some type of multiyear rate plan going forward. I know you have forward test years and annual rate cases have worked out well for company, especially in Michigan, which is pretty favorable state for investors. But has there been any consideration for some type of multiyear situation going forward? Patricia Poppe : Yes, Michael you make a really good point in fact that we do have forward-looking test gears. And so what we like about our annual filing is first of all, just because we file a rate case doesn't necessarily mean customers bills are going up and as Rejji described in his prepared remarks, we can do capital investment and this business model of ours where cost savings are passed along to customers has to occur in those proceedings. And so our annual filing provides us two what I think are big advantages particularly given the certainty of the regulatory environment here in Michigan. One that we have alignment with the commission before we spend it. So we have no risk post a rate order that will have disallowances. We have alignment on the work that we're going to do. We have alignment on the investments that we're going to make and so that is a real certainty going forward. But two, it also allows us to adjust the plan as conditions change and we can pass along the cost savings that the team achieves while we're adjusting those plans. So we can build the budget, we can build an operating plan that matches and agreed upon framework with the commission. And so I think that's good regulation. I think that's the right kind of transparency, the right kind of certainty and yet at the same time demonstrates agility as we move forward and conditions change around us. I do think it's in the best interest of our customers. Michael Weinstein : Great and also for The DIG plan, as you go forward with the by the Michigan Supreme Court, do you think you'll be trending more towards the upper end of that opportunity range of 3 to 750 going forward? Patricia Poppe : Yes. Exactly Michael in October 21, for example, we secured some contracts for planning year 24 and 25 and 25 and 26 at the $4.25 kilowatt month. We secured about 30 megawatts. So we're definitely seeing pick up that wasn't all the way at comp. But with the LCR, there's only all the few places within zone 7, which is Michigan's lower peninsula where an alternative energy supplier can secure that capacity and DIG is one of those places and so we've absolutely already seen a little bit of that upside. Michael Weinstein : Great and I guess that's about it for now. Thank you very much. Patricia Poppe : Great. Thanks Michael. Operator : Next question today comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shahriar Pourreza : Good morning guys. Patricia Poppe : Morning Shahr. Shahriar Pourreza : Just couple of questions here. So just on equity you obviously had, you don't have any equity in 19 that was deferred to 2020. And then you've got 250 millions planned for this year. What is, can you remind us what is your new 21 guidance embed in terms of equity and how we think about sort of the perpetual need is it should be just assume around 150 million per year level set for 2020 excluding the 2019 that you deferred into 2020? Rejji Hayes : Yes Shahr just to be clear, we haven't provided a point of view based on our latest modeling for equity needs in 21 and beyond but I think the working assumption that we provided as we rolled out our five-year plan in the first quarter of this year. We said 250 this year as you rightly note, and then we send run rate 150 per year that presuppose a $12.2 billion five year capital plan at the utility. And so as you know, we provide a new five-year look in Q1 and every year on our fourth quarter earnings call and so it will calibrate, will look at what the capital plan looks like from 21 through 25. And if that dictates additional equity needs then we will adjust accordingly, but I will say this, I feel very confident that this has been our general rule of thumb that we will be able to continue. We need to increase equity need to fill line of the capital plan. We should be able to continue to avoid block equity and really just be able to execute our equity needs to our dribble program, which I generally like to think is around 1.5% to 2% of our market cap. So we feel that the equity needs may change. We'll see what the math ends up in our 5-year plan, but I don't expect us to be issuing material amount equity every year going forward. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And then just on the cost savings, you call that 100 million savings in 2020 actively being reinvested. How much of that is the first mortgage bonds and opportunistic refinancing year-to-date and how do we think about sort of that being one time versus sort of perpetual nature? I mean what types of things are you learning as you move past the crisis stage of COVID? Rejji Hayes : Yes. It's a great question Shahr and so I think generally, we look at identify and realize cost savings are two classes. There are operating cost savings and non-operating cost savings. What we highlighted in our prepared remarks and this has been an ongoing theme over the course of this year as well in Q2. The vast majority of the savings realized to-date have been operating savings. There have been some not operating savings. So you probably saw in a waterfall slide that we had about 7% the benefits. Those are clearly non-operating and then Sri and the team and treasury have been really quite opportunistic in executing on a very attractively priced financing of the course this year. I can come back on the exact EPS amount. I think we had about a penny or two of upside this year and we do anticipate a good portion of that being ongoing and sustainable because the reality is if you price the bond below plan particularly with the recent plan you obviously have their savings over the life of the bond. And now obviously our debt financing needs will increase to fund capital and so you have some new money in there, but to refi those lower bond financing particular when we pull forward a bond maturities we have in the past those savings you should get it for several years. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it, perfect. And then just one last one for me on sort of the load growth obviously reported very healthy weather adjusted load numbers in the third quarter. Curious on what you're embedding in the guidance for 21. What are you assuming as far as COVID-related backdrop to keep kind of slightly alluded to it a little bit in the prepared? But are you assuming sort of V-shaped recovery, which is I think what a lot of your peers is saying or are you seeing sort of a more gradual pick up like what's kind of embedded in plan you touched a little bit on the contingency there but it seems like from what you're highlighting even if you see another protracted downturn or even a weakening in the residential market that you have enough lovers to offset sort of that headwind but I don't want to leave the witness ready. So you go. Rejji Hayes : Yes. So let me approach that in a couple of ways Shahr. So first there are I'll say the sales assumptions embeded in the pending election rate case which will capture all of fiscal year 2021 and so we're past the evidentiary phase. I don't want to pre-judge or foreshadow where the commission may end up. But I think clearly there is a change in the assumptions embedded in the rate case and then what we've observed over the course of 2020 and as we've talked about the last several quarters now we are seeing a favorable mix in the form of residential in excess of expectations and C&I I'll say slightly down. Now the variables which could lead to a tailwind in 2021, it's clearly residential. We've seen just this sustained level of residential non-weather uptick and I think it has a lot to do with remote working a number of companies have sustained that and we said we have a sense they may sustain it even post-pandemic and so that could provide a bit of a tailwind going into next year. And then the rate or pace at which C&I has recovered over the course this year has also been a little bit of surprise to the upside. And so going into the next year there's what's invented in the rate case and so there may be a little bit of upside there but then if you think about okay now that we're 10 months smarter since we filed our rate case what are we seeing and how do we think that compares to what we've seen over the course of 2020. And I'll say it's fair to assume that the pandemic started out in the kind of mid March timeframe in Michigan and we had the shelter in place in late March and so a lot of the effects of the pandemics are flowing through our 2020 forecast. And so when you think of the year-over-year comparison, I don't expect we'll see a material bump in residential versus what we've experienced so far in 2020 because again a lot of that's already reflected in our numbers but I do think C&I will see I think it could be flatish. I hate to put a letter to any type of shape of a recovery. I would say the Nike Swoosh seems to me to be the most applicable shape. I've also heard people talk about a K-shape because you will have some sectors that bounce back quickly and some that do not and so I hate the hazard to guess at this point. But I think it'll be a gradual recovery and a continued recovery for C&I. Again we've been surprised to be upset but pandemic has yet to be contained. So we'll obviously plan cautiously as we always do. Shahriar Pourreza : Terrific. Thanks guys. Congrats again. Patricia Poppe : Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you Shahr. Operator : And our next question today comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hi good morning team. Two big picture questions, one election around the corner just can I get your thoughts the opportunities and risks the climate plan and a potential tax change I appreciate early but just any thoughts there? Patricia Poppe : Yes. You bet just at the highest order as we have always said we work with everyone and so we're sure that America will sort out all of this election business. Now we know I think what to expect from Donald Trump and his administration and that's been working fine for us. If Joe Biden is elected and there's a stronger push for a clean energy transition or a carbon-free electric sector, we have a plan that's pretty aggressive already. We have a plan that gets to net zero by 2040. And so even when he says 2035 in kind of campaign ads the idea of it really being national at 2035 seems aggressive. But we could actually work to adapt. One thing we'd like to remind people about this is that as we make this clean energy transition and we've been very ambitious as you know we've retired seven of our 12 coal plants already reduced our carbon emissions by 40%. Our net zero plan for 2040 puts us again about a decade ahead of most in the industry and so given that we feel like there's a need for some technology advancements in those outer years and when those breakthroughs occur and as the cost of solar and potentially storage continues to decline we'll look forward to accelerating our plans. And we know that that can be good for both for our triple bottom-line people, planet and profit. So we're pretty agnostic on the outcome of the elections. We think there's our clean energy plan stands on its own. Rejji maybe you want to talk about some of the tax implications of Biden administration? Rejji Hayes : I'd be happy to. So Durgesh as you know the Biden team has rolled out at least a preliminary look on fiscal policy and so what we've seen is a potential increase in the marginal tax rate from 21% to 28% and since federal tax reform is in the two distant past you may recall just sort of the puts and takes that we saw there and so I think conceptually you can anticipate that there may be a rate increase and that's obviously the inverse of what we saw when we went from a 35% tax rate down to 21% and so there would potentially be a rate increase and the commission in Michigan was very thoughtful and how they incorporated that into our filing process and I anticipate that they'll probably take a similar approach. And so obviously that will eat into headroom, but I think we've proven time and time again irrespective of the headwind we'll manage the cost to make sure that our customers bills stay at or below inflation. And so there will be a likely rate impact that you see an increase in tax rate. Now the upside is that there was cash flow and credit metric degradation on the heels of federal tax reform. So if you see a 7% increase in the marginal tax rate you should see a cash flow benefit as well as some credit metric accretion on the other side of that and that will presumably lower our funding costs and that too will offset some of the rate impact. So I think you'll see some pros and cons and it's almost the inverse of what we saw when we had federal tax reform in 17. Durgesh Chopra : Understood guys. Thanks for all the color. One quick follow-up, just on strategy and long-term strategy so a couple transactions here year-to-date portfolio optimization companies kind of sort of streamlining the businesses, selling non-regulated businesses. Just your mostly latest thoughts on interbank and your other round regulated businesses how does it fit into your long-term value proposition? And then just flipping the coin and perhaps even opportunities for expansion given sort of the multiple you're trading at versus peers? Patricia Poppe : Well, great questions Durgesh. First of all the interbank team, shout out to that team they're performing well and benefiting from this year actually from the uptick in home improvement. I've heard in fact it's called investing and nesting and interbank is being participating in that. So that's been good, but really the bottom-line is this we're very content with our business mix where it is. And I just want to remind everyone that our utility is far and away the driver of our growth at CMS energy with 90% of our business mix and really so to that end there is really nothing new to share about our non-regulated businesses and we just, we manage them very much like we manage our utility business with consistency, high quality off-takers long-term contracts, leveraging our core competency, downside risk management, no big bets we like our mix. Durgesh Chopra : Excellent and just maybe any thoughts on potential expansion M&A? Patricia Poppe : Yes, it just ends up not really being on the top of our list given our organic growth strategy. We've got ample CapEx to deploy. People ask us because of the CE way is that something you could deploy and maybe someday we would want to but that's a long time from now. We really, we have a solid five year capital, ten year capital plan and the next five years we have got real visibility to our ability to deliver growth and shareholder value. Durgesh Chopra : Appreciate the time Patty. Thanks so much. Patricia Poppe : You're welcome. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Hi good morning guys. Patricia Poppe : Hey Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : Hi. Just a quick one on the $3 billion to $6 billion Patti that you called out and the renewables or it sort of sits on the on top of the 2040 bar on that slide. I am just curious how much of that is in the 10 year plan versus sort of in the subsequent years? Patricia Poppe : Yes, great question. We have a billion dollars, actually $1.8 billion in renewables in the five-year plan and the 10-year plan we have a potential for additional maybe even up to $3 billion of total renewables in the 10-year plan and so when we think about the three to six think of 2040 that's another 10 years. But our solar deployments are front end loaded. We have of our 6,000 megawatts of solar we intend to deploy by 2040. 5,000 of it is by 2030. So that really makes up and that's already in our 10-year plan but we'll share more visibility to that when we update the capital plan at the year-end call. Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thank you for that. And then just a little more high level you've been very clear that you're going to be using the outperformance you've had this year and the sales help to reinvest and not just in 2021, but also beyond. And so but I'm curious to why have a range on earnings growth and why not just target seven and then yes sort of secondary to that what could potentially push you to age in a given year seeing how you're handling this year for example? Patricia Poppe : Yes Jonathan. I will remind you that our six to eight are $0.04 range. So a single point we're practically a single point as it is. But we do think that this top tier 7% EPS growth for the sector is among the best and particularly when you factor in the consistency of it and I just think as a utility that you can count on for six to eight with a $0.04 range. The push to 8% it has a temporary benefit but we would prefer to have an annual take it home, take it to the bank, sleep at night we ride that straight, we ride that rollercoaster so you can plan on that straight line and so the idea of pushing it to eight what we've always said in fact when we first announced that we were going to six to eight years ago we said there might be a year that there were surprises to the upside. But what I want to be really clear about is that this year we have ample opportunity to redeploy those savings into protecting outer years and that's always our first priority. And so I don't want to mislead anyone and make them think there's going to be a sugar high in 2020. This is the perfect kind of year to plan for uncertainty we're heading into for 2021 and making sure that 22 can be delivered too. Jonathan Arnold : We like that stability so thanks for the reminder. Patricia Poppe : Yes. Thank you Jonathan. Operator : And our next question today comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Good morning. Rejji Hayes : Good morning Steven. Patricia Poppe : Good morning. Stephen Byrd : Congrats on the continued strong execution. A lot of my questions have been addressed. I wanted to go back to the point about in the event that there is a democratic sweep and there's clean energy legislation and I just wanted to talk a little bit more about your resource mix. You have a resource plan as you mentioned coming up in mid-21 and if there was legislation that extended tax credits for wind and solar perhaps created a new tax credit for storage. Is it your sense that that would be enough to essentially sort of tip the scales further meaningfully in favor of renewables adoption more quickly and phasing out fossil fuels more quickly just given the magnitude? How do you kind of think about the sort of magnitude of impact of that kind of support on your kind of thinking on your resource plan? Patricia Poppe : Yes Stephen great question. A couple things. One I do think further tax incentives on storage would be beneficial. I think what's going to be more beneficial is the amount of R&D that's underway in storage. You and I have talked many times about the electric vehicles and all the research happening there on battery storage. Some of the research that's being done on hydrogen, both for fuel cells for vehicles but more importantly for us from a perspective of hydrogen as a fuel cell version of storage on our system. Those kinds of whether it's tax treatment or R&D investments can accelerate the deployment of clean energy and we look forward to that. There is a real problem with the ITC with solar that utilities can't because of normalization can't take full advantage. I think if there were some fixes from a tax perspective on the ITC for solar that could be interesting for utilities and could potentially make solar deployments more economic faster. And so I do think there will be some interesting developments with them if there is in fact a blue wave here in a couple weeks. Stephen Byrd : That's helpful. Rejji Hayes : The only thing I will add to Patti's comment is that obviously the tax credits can help address the cost related problem or cost-related challenge and that's a big element of thee equation, but the other elements of the equation obviously are resource adequacy and I'll also add balance sheet to that equation. And so I think if you're getting at whether that could lead to an accelerated retirement of coal, you'd have to see an improvement in the cost and again tax credits may get that but also the efficacy of those alternative resources if you really want to be comfortable taking out say two gigawatts of coal on an accelerated basis and then balance sheet Moody still continues to impute securitization as debt. And so again if you think about the rate base we have in our coal facilities and that potentially becoming dead in an accelerated fashion there are balance sheet issues as well. So I think cost is a huge component that tax credits could solve but we have to make sure that all elements of the equation add up to the interest of the triple bottom-line. Stephen Byrd : Yes Rejji, it's a good point about sort of the balance sheet treatment if you're required to do a PPA and the negative impacts to your balance sheet. I guess if I were to thinking through what you both said if there were a way for utilities to actually really utilize the tax credits which could require modification well let's assume that that modification could happen and if there was a way by tax credits to reduce the cost of storage. Would those types of changes together potentially permit a somewhat more aggressive shift shutdown of coal and more aggressive deployment of renewable storage? Are those the kinds of changes that could actually kind of make a difference in your thinking? Patricia Poppe : Those are some of the changes. I think we have to prove the efficacy of these distributed resources Stephen. There's a lot of theories about it. I think we need to prove to ourselves that with a distributed resource mix we can provide the reliability that customers want. We can't have rolling curtailments because we didn't plan and don't have the resources necessary. So I think the timing when we think about our 2040 net zero plan that feels to us like a good timeline to really build out these new technologies and including the energy efficiency and demand response. Those things take time to enroll customers and get the right behaviors. And so I do think there's a two prong there's the cost as we've talked about but there's also as Rejji mentioned the efficacy of those resources and making sure that we can provide the reliability that customers expect and so that you have to actually build the stuff and prove it to ourselves before we can scale the whole system. Stephen Byrd : That makes sense. Thanks so much for the thoughtful comments. That's all I had. Patricia Poppe : Yes. Thanks Stephen. Operator : And our next question today comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller : Good morning. Thank you. Patricia Poppe : Morning Travis. Travis Miller : I was wondering if you could give your thoughts on the role that you'll play in the healthy climate plan. I know you've got a lot of the goals already out there and the investments out there that correspond to the goals in that plan. But just wondering next year if you'll be involved specifically in the planning and goal setting around that and then kind of any other thoughts in terms of how it might affect say your next five years in the early stages of the plan? Patricia Poppe : Yes. We will definitely be involved. We're a trusted resource here in Michigan as a clean energy leader and the clean energy advocates. I think it's just reaffirming to our clean energy plan that we filed and it certainly is an ambitious goal for Michigan, but we really intend to continue to be leaders and our IRP is very much in support of the governor's ambition. Travis Miller : Okay. What do you think about the political viability of that I mean when you're talking about 20 plus years of a policy obviously politics can change here? What are your thoughts around that and the buy-in from all the different parties in Michigan and industries even to five year plan? Patricia Poppe : Yes. You make a great point because there's a couple things that are going to be challenging I think for Michigan but one of the things we've learned here in Michigan. The actual law that we passed in 2008 and then I'd say upgraded in 2016 is where the actual targets get set that drive actions and they're more near-term clearly. Our RPS for example in 2016 well in 2008 was 10% by 2015 and then 2016 we passed a law to take it to 15% by 2020. Those incremental concrete targets get passed in legislation. So you're absolutely right there needs to be a full appreciation and adoption and energy legislation here in Michigan has been typically happening about every eight years or so. So it would take some time I think to get new legislation passed. But nonetheless the other challenge here in Michigan with natural gas for example for home heating is very economic and so I think a politically a difficult uphill battle to tell all Michiganders are going to pay twice as much for their home heating I think that's a challenge that politically would be hard to overcome without a significant change over time. Travis Miller : Okay. Great. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question today comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So Patti you just mentioned your gas LDC and so I have two questions about it. One is this is really the first season that your gas LDC will be going through COVID like conditions so and obviously it's a bit of a guessing game. But do you have a similar customer mix on the gas side, the electric side and then so the trends that you've seen in volumes could be replicated at the gas utility you think? Patricia Poppe : Yes. We don't expect the same kind of uptick in use. Most people heat their homes and keep them at that level they might lower it a couple degrees during the day while they're at work. But we don't expect sort of the increase that we've seen on the electric side. However, we are more residential mix on the gas business but we have ample supplies here in Michigan. We are blessed with robust energy, natural gas storage fields here in Michigan and we have no concerns about having any inability to meet the needs of our customers for their winter heating. Angie Storozynski : Okay and my second question is you just mentioned the economics of gas-based heating versus electric heat pumps in Michigan. But on the other hand we have seen this meaningful de-rating of standalone gas LDCs you guys own a big one. It's coupled with electric utility so you haven't seen an impact. But if you look at your longer term growth plans do you feel the need to shift some of your spending away from the gas LDC towards the electric utility because that's basically the preference of investors and also that's more of a trend to dig up decarbonize the entire entity? Patricia Poppe : Well, there's a couple thoughts as we look at our capital planning. Number one a safe and reliable gas system is extraordinarily valuable today and will be in the coming decades. Safety is always number one. And the replacements that we are doing are like for life. We're not adding capacity. We're making our system safer and by the way at the same time reducing methane emissions. So it's both good for people and the planet and then those investments obviously have reliable returns. So it's our triple bottom-line thinking there. I would also say that the electric utility, the combo the fact that we're a combo utility does make us hedge to some degree if there is a big push for electrification, if electric home heating becomes a real trend then we will be able to benefit from that and in fact the earnings potential is even greater in that perspective. But when we think about it from a triple line, bottom-line perspective we think we can do the net zero methane target for 2030 as we've stated through our capital investments in the gas system without hazarding sort of stranded assets and I guess I would just offer in a state like Michigan with the kind of temperatures we experience and the value that customers receive for the cost of natural gas we'll be the last to go. I mean, our customers are really going to, they appreciate our natural gas as a home heating source and so I think it'd be a long time before there's a big change there but when that change happens as a combo utility we're in a good position to weather that. Angie Storozynski : Great, thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from [indiscernible] please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning Patti, good morning Rejji. Patricia Poppe : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : I know you addressed it earlier Durgesh\u2019s question, but you're comfortable with your business mix. I think utility is the one that's really growing like a 90% mix between regulated and non-regulated businesses. But if you start to see other utilities and I know you're not going to comment on DT, but if DT would go like 100% regulated or it seems that all utilities even that small slice of 10% of non-regulated earnings are CMS's benefit from maybe being one of the more robust valued companies, but would that cause you to look again at the business mix that you have? Patricia Poppe : You know like I said Anthony and I'll just reiterate we're really comfortable with our business mix 90 :10 and when we think about our enterprises business in particular we learn a lot from customers having them in the family. We get a chance to understand what the competitive marketplace looks like and it makes us a better utility and so we're very satisfied as I mentioned with our business mix. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Patricia Poppe : You're welcome. Thanks Anthony. Operator : And our next question today comes from David Fishman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Fishman : Good morning Patti and Rejji. Patricia Poppe : Good morning David. David Fishman : Just a quick question on the IRP filings, I believe had about 1.1 gigawatts or so of solar 50% own 50 PPAs. I was just wondering if you could discuss if your thinking has evolved at all around maybe the appropriate balance between PPA and utility ownership in the future especially as CMS has started getting a little more scale and renewables and just how you might be able to deliver a better value for customers? Patricia Poppe : Yes. We will refile an IRP every three to five years and so as I mentioned we're preparing for next summer to file our next one. The agreement that we made for 50 :50 ownership and purchasing PPAs with the financial compensation mechanism we felt was a great outcome for customers. It's a competitive marketplace. We're getting to see and observe the landscape. We do continue to learn and it'll be interesting to continue to learn. So I guess I would say it's too soon to say that we would recommend a change because we feel like it has provided a huge benefit to customers and investors given the FCM combined with the ownership and the PPAs. So I would just suggest it is too early to say that we would recommend any kind of change there and we continue to learn and balance that triple bottom-line. David Fishman : I think that makes a lot of sense and just one quick follow-up on that. I know in the past you guys have kind of discussed how you like have a smoother less lumpy CapEx kind of project profile. Would having too many large renewable investment opportunities at once kind of be going away from that or is that something that you can get comfortable with just theoretically? Patricia Poppe : No. It is one of the things we love about renewables is that they are modular just in nature and so we can phase them in and as demand grows we can move them faster. If demand diminishes we can install them more slowly. We're not going to have just one big project. We're going to have lots of call it 200, 300 megawatt projects, maybe 100 megawatt projects and that gives us real modularity and I think that's a huge advantage to this clean energy transition over the old traditional just building big central station power plant, you were locked in. Once you dug that first hole there you went and that was going to be a real challenge if conditions changed and so we do love renewables for that feature. David Fishman : Perfect. Very helpful. Those are all my questions. Congrats on great quarter. Patricia Poppe : Thanks. Operator : And our next question today comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Andrew Weisel : Thanks. Good morning everybody. A lot of good details so I've just got two quick one\u2019s for you. One housekeeping and one big picture. First it looks like the overall liquidity fell by about a billion dollars mostly related to lower unrestricted cash balance. Is that a timing issue and will it reverse or are you comfortable with the overall liquidity at around 2 billion versus over 3 previously? Rejji Hayes : Andrew, I'll answer your last question first. I mean the quick answer is very comfortable with 2 billion net liquidity position and I mentioned in Q2 that the 3 billion that we had at that point there was a bit of timing in that where we had some looming maturity that just didn't flow through our second quarter numbers and they were pending and you'll see that if you compare the maturities in this document versus what we shared in the second quarter. We feel very good about the 2 billion. My sense it'll come down a little bit more again because in the nation stages of the pandemic we really wanted to err on the side of having excess liquidity particularly given the cost of funds but longer term again we will not have a bunch of lazy capital just sitting on our balance sheet. We'll put it to work and that's what we look to do over the next couple of quarters. Andrew Weisel : Yes. There is definitely a capital raising bonanza in March and April. That makes sense. My other question is maybe a little esoteric but you talked a bit about Michigan's naturally occurring natural gas storage fields in the context of hydrogen potentially being one of the next big things. Do you know geologically could those storage fields store hydrogen? Patricia Poppe : We are studying that. We understand that it's likely that they can and so we do find that intriguing and as we're doing our long-term gas planning, wandering and looking for opportunities to pilot being able to use hydrogen in a different way whether it's as a portion of our mix, whether we would use it in some blend in our power generating at our natural gas power plants or just in the system. So we're doing a lot of homework and study on hydrogen right now. We've joined with [indiscernible] and their carbon studies. So we're excited about learning more and we have a feeling that Michigan is going to be extraordinarily well-positioned if in fact that transformation starts to occur. Andrew Weisel : Good to hear. Thank you very much. Patricia Poppe : Thanks Andrew. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Patti Poppe for any final remarks. Patricia Poppe : Thanks Rocco and thanks again everyone for joining us today. I'd love to take just a moment to highlight that we will be working with [indiscernible] again this year to continue our efforts. We're never satisfied and so we're going to continue to pursue world-class performance including an investor relation. So be on the lookout for an email from the team for more details on that survey and we look forward to your honest feedback and continued support. We wish you all please be safe, be well and make sure to wear your darn mask. Thanks so much. Have a great day. Operator : And thank you ma'am. Today's conference is not concluded. We thank you for your participation. You may not expect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning everyone and welcome to the CMS Energy Fourth Quarter 2020 Results. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct the question and answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator instructions]. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this call today beginning at 12 :00 p.m. Eastern Time running through February. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Srikanth Maddipati : Thank you, Rocco. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I will turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Sri, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the past couple months as I transitioned into the CEO role. I'm excited to be hosting my first earnings call and sharing yet another year of consistent industry-leading financial performance. Before I discuss our year-end results and our updated five-year capital investment plan, I want to take a moment to reiterate our simple but powerful investment thesis. Well, simple to put on paper, its not even replicate. And that is what set apart. It starts the industry-leading commitment to the clean energy and gas systems to achieve decarbonization. These investment opportunities are supported by constructive energy legislation as well as alignment with the commission and the MPSC staff. This strong regulatory and legislative framework is why Michigan is consistently ranked the top tier regulatory jurisdiction. But investment opportunity and a supportive regulatory environment are not enough. Our focused on affordability is critical. So our customers can afford these investments. Now, I've been with the company for 18 years, much of it in operations. Over that time, we demonstrated our ability to consistently manage cost as it invested in the safety and reliability of our systems, while improving customer service. That ability to manage cost is not driven from the top down, but from the bottom up. Its our 500 coworkers who are committed to excellence, delivering the highest value to our customers at the lowest cost possible. This is embedded in our culture and it was built in partnership with our union over the last two decades. These unique attributes to the CMS story would allow us to deliver for customers and you, our investors. Our adjusted EPS growth of 68% combined with our dividend provide the premium to all shareholder return of 9% to 11%. Our ability to deliver this growth each and every year is something we are uniquely capable of doing. Regardless of weather, a global pandemic, who's leading our state our commission or our company, we have delivered consistent industry-leading results year-in and year-out, 2020 prove this, 2021 will be no different. In 2020, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.67, up 7% from 2019 and achieve operating cash flow of almost $2 billion, excluding $700 million of voluntary pension contributions in 2020. Today, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2021 by a penny to $2.83 to $2.87, with a focus on the midpoint. This reflects annual growth of 6% to 8% from our 2020 results. Last month, we announced our 15th dividend increase in as many years, $1.74 per share, up 7% from the prior year. We continue to target long term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%, again, with a focus on the midpoint. Today, we're also increasing our five-year capital plan to $13.2 billion, up $1 billion from our prior plan, 18th consecutive years of industry leading financial performance. I'll let that sit with you for a moment. I'm pleased with our financial performance. But equally important is our commitment to the triple bottom line. We balanced everything we do for our co-workers, customers, and the communities we serve, our planet and our investors as demonstrated on slide six. 2020. 2020 was a tough year for everyone. The global pandemic impacted all of us emotionally, physically and financially. Through it all, I am proud of the work done by our co-workers. We were able to provide over $80 million of support to our customers and communities in 2020 through support programs, low income assistance, donations to foundations, and reinvestment to improve safety and reliability. We focused our efforts on COVID relief for residential and small business customers, payment forgiveness, as well as enhanced support in the area of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Despite changing our work practices as a result of a pandemic, we maintain first portal employee engagement, achieved first portal customer experience and attracted 126 megawatts of new load to our state, which brings with it significant investment in over 4000 new jobs. From a planet perspective, we continue to lead the clean energy transition. We added over 800 megawatts of new winds and are executing on 300 megawatts of new solar, the first tranche of our integrated resource plan. Further in our commitment, over $700 million of investments were made to advance our clean energy transition. Additionally, our demand response and energy efficiency programs continue to save our customers money, reduce carbon and earn an incentive. And last, but certainly not least, we finished the year with more than $100 million in cost savings driven by the CE WAY. Many of you have asked about my commitment to the CE WAY. A light blue arrow at the bottom on the slide and my experience, leading this operating system over the past five years should be a strong signal. I'll tell you this. We are positioned well. But there is still more opportunity. Through the CE WAY, we will continue to improve reliability, reduce waste and deliver better customer service. And that just a tip of the iceberg. There are opportunities in every corner of the company to achieve excellence through the CE WAY. My coworkers and I remain committed. We will continue to lead the clean energy transition with support from our new five-year $13.2 billion capital investment plan was translates to over 7% annual rate base growth and focuses on enhancing the safety and reliability of our system as we move toward net zero carbon and methane emissions. In fact, 40% of our plan directly supports our clean energy transition, and includes our renewable generation, electric distribution and investments to support this generation, grid monetization, as well as programs like our main invented service replacement programs, which reduce methane emissions. In addition to our traditional rate base returns, our wind investments, renewable PPAs and demand and resources are supported by regulatory incentives above and beyond our ROEs. These incremental earnings mechanisms enhance our earned returns, and combined with our investments in clean energy, our growing percentage of our earnings mix. Our customer's ability to afford the investments in our system is complemented by our continued focus on cost savings. Over the last decade, we have reduced that utility bill as a percentage of the customer's wallet. And we continue to see further opportunity to reduce costs in the future. We had unique cost saving opportunities relative to peers and to above market PPAs, Palisades and MCV, which will generate nearly $140 million of power supply cost recovery in savings. This, coupled with the future retirement of our remaining coal facilities provides over $200 million savings for our customers. These structural cost savings combined with the productivity we'll deliver through the CE WAY will ensure we deliver on our capital plan and keep customer bills affordable. Now the great thing, the great thing about the CE WAY is it delivers more than cost savings. What makes us unique is our engaged coworkers. We value our best in sector employee engagement. And our 8500 coworkers work every day to deliver the best value for our customers. This engaged workforce has doubled productivity, which has enabled us to consistently increase our capital plan without significantly increasing our workforce. Furthermore, we have never served our customers better as we've moved from the bottom quartile to top quartile, not just in the utility industry, but across all industries. Slide nine serves as an excellent of how our team leverage the CE WAY to deliver on our triple bottom line. Our ability to deliver this level of excellence for our customers and investors is supported by Michigan's constructive regulatory environment. We benefit from a legislative and regulatory construct that supports our rate case proceeding and the statute that allows financial incentives above and beyond Karn authorized ROE. Michigan's regulatory jurisdiction has been ranked in the top tier since 2013. That's not by accident. It's a reflection of the hard work my coworkers do every day to earn the trust of our customers, policymakers, environmental groups and the MPSC staff. We are proud to have a commission that demonstrates strong leadership with diverse backgrounds, which was enhanced with the appointment of Commissioner Paratek. We welcome Commissioner Paratek and look forward to working with her in the future. Turning to slide 11. You know we have a light regulatory docket with no financially significant regulatory outcomes in 2021. With the approval of our Karn securitization and electric rate case in December of last year, we'll file our next electric rate case in the first quarter and our gas rate case in December of this year. Notably, we'll follow set iteration of our integrated resource plan in June. I'm sure many of you would like a sneak peek, but its too early. We're in the midst of the modeling phase. You can be confident that this next iteration will continue to build on industry-leading clean energy commitments. And we'll find ways to get cleaner, faster and incorporate storage and customer driven solutions as they become more cost effective. Beyond that, we'll ask you to stay tuned until our second quarter earnings call. We will provide more information after we filed. I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report our 2020 adjusted net income of $764 million or $2.67 per share, up 7% year-over-year of our 2019 actuals. Now briefly note that our adjusted EPS excludes select non-recurring items previously discussed in our third quarter earnings call and enumerated in this morning's releases. To elaborate on the key drivers of our year-end results we released -- we realized increases in rate relief, net investments due to constructive orders and our recent gas and electric rate cases, strong performance in our non utility segments, and most notably, our historic company-wide cost reduction efforts led by the CE WAY, which Garrick noted earlier. These positive factors were partially offset by mild weather and reinvestment were flex up back into the business. We've talked in the past about our practice of flexing up, which enables us to put financial upside to work in the second half of the year, to pull ahead or commit to work to improve the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems, to fund customer support programs, which was particularly important in 2020, given the effects of the pandemic, invest in coworker training programs, and de risk our financial plan in subsequent years. This tried and true approach benefits all stakeholders which is the essence of the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. On slide 13 you'll not that we meet our key financial objectives for the year. To avoid being repetitive with Garrick's earlier remarks, I'll just note that we invested $2.3 billion of capital in our electric and gas infrastructure to benefit customer's including investments in wind farms, which add approximately $500 million of RPS related rate base, which I'll remind you earns a premium return on equity of 10.7%. I'll also note that our treasury team had a banner year, successfully raising approximately $3.5 billion of cost effective capital, which include roughly $250 million of equity while navigating turbulent capital market conditions over the course of 2020. These efforts further strengthen our balance sheet to the benefit of customers and investors. Turning the page to 2021. As mentioned, we are raising our 2021 adjusted earnings guidance to $2.83 to $2.87 per share, which implies 6% to 8% annual growth offer 2020 actuals. Unsurprisingly, the majority of our growth will be driven by the utility. And I'll also note a modest level of anticipated upside at the parent and other segment in 2021, largely due to the absence of select non-operating flex items execute in 2020. All-in, we will continue to target the midpoint of our consolidated EPS growth range of 7% at year end, which is in excess of the sector average. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve for our 2021 EPS guidance range. As you'll note in the waterfall chart on slide 15, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.06 per share, a positive year-over-year variants given the mild winter weather experienced in 2020. Additionally, we anticipate $0.41 of the EPS pickup in 2021 attributable to rate relief, net investment costs, largely driven by the orders received in the second half of 2020. It is also worth noting that the magnitude of EPS impact here is in part due to the absence of an electric rate increase in 2020, which was a condition of our 2019 settlement agreement. While we do plan to file an electric case in Q1 of this year, as Garrick mentioned, that test year and economic impacts for that case will commence in 2022. As we look at our cost structure in 2021, you'll note approximately $0.27 per share of negative variance attributable to incremental O&M approved in our recent rate cases to support key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonisation. Needless to say, we have underlying assumptions around productivity and waste elimination, driven by the CE WAY, and we'll always endeavor to overachieve on those targets, while delivering substantial value for our customers. Lastly, we apply our usual conservative assumptions around sales, financings and other items. And I'll note that while the pandemic remains relatively uncontained, we're assuming a gradual return of weather normalized load to pre-pandemic levels around mid year. In the event the mass teleworking trend persists and/or we see an accelerated reopening of the Michigan economy, we could potentially see some upside from incremental residential and commercial margin. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions and circumstances throughout the year to mitigate risks and increase the likelihood of meeting our operational and financial objectives. We're often asked whether we can sustain our consistent industry-leading growth in the long term given widespread concerns about economic conditions or potential changes in fiscal energy and/or environmental policy. And our answer remains the same. Irrespective of the circumstances, we view it our job to do the warrant for you. Our EPS charge on slide 16 illustrates one of our key strength, which is to identify and eliminate financial risk and capitalize on opportunities as they emerged to deliver additional benefits to customers, while sustaining our financial success over the long term for investors. Each year provides a different fact pattern and we've always risen to the occasion. 2020 offered some unique challenges resulting from the pandemic, and more familiar sources of risk in the form of mild winter weather. And as usual, we didn't make excuses. Instead, we offer transparency, devise our course of action and counted on the perennial will of our 8500 coworkers to deliver for our customers, the communities we serve, and for you, our investors. To summarize our financial objectives in the near and long term, we expect 6% to 8%, adjusted EPS and dividend growth and strong operating cash flow generation. From the balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment grade credit ratings, and we'll manage the key credit metrics accordingly. One item I'll note in this regard is that we have slightly modified our FFO to debt targets to line better with the various rating agency methodologies. Given the increase in our five-year capital plan, we anticipate annual equity needs of up to $250 million in 2021 and beyond, which we are confident that we can comfortably raise through our equity dribble program to minimize pricing risk. And two additional items I'll mention with respect to our financial strength as we kick off 2021 that are not on the page, but no less important, or that we concluded 2020 with $1.6 billion of net liquidity, which positions our balance sheet well as we execute our updated capital plan going forward. And we have fully funded benefit plans for the second year in a row due to proactive funding, the latter of which benefits roughly 3,000 of our active coworkers and 8,000 of our retirees. Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices, while our coworkers remain engaged, well trained and cared for in our purpose driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance. To conclude my prepared remarks on slide 18, we've refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions, rate orders already in place and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for some final comments before Q&A. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Rejji. Our investment thesis remains simple, but unique. It enables us to deliver for all our stakeholders, year-in and year-out. We remain committed to lead the clean energy transition, excellence through the CE WAY and delivering a premium total shareholder return through continued capital investment. The benefits that triple bottom line. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you very much, Gary. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Just one -- thanks. Just wanted to start off I guess on renewables CapEx deployment. Seems like that stepped up a little bit there. And just wondering I guess your appetite or your vision of how you see that could progress over time? And just want to clarify as well specifically on slide 22. When you talk about the clean energy generation there, how much of that is regulated versus non-regulated spend? Thanks Garrick Rochow : Yes. Thanks for your question. Let's just talk broadly about the renewables and the likes. So first of all, we have industry-leading commitments. And I want to be clear about that is one of the best in the industry out there. And so it's aggressive plan from a build out perspective. In our current integrated resource plan, we have 1.1 gigawatts of solar, that is part of the build out with a broader plan of six gigawatts of solar. And then, in the course of this integrated resource plan is Rev 2, which we'll file in June, we'll continue to advance our aggressive plans and our leadership in the clean energy transition. And so what you're picking up in our capital plan an additional $1 billion, you're right on the mark, Jeremy, there's more renewables to the tune about $200 million of additional solar and renewables in that plan. There's 200 million of hydro. And that might be surprising for some, but that's the original renewable, that's carbon free. And if you think about our Ludington Pumped storage facility, which is the largest, fourth largest in the in the world, it provides an important role in intermittency. There's 300 million for electric reliability can improve service out there, but also prepare the grid for the future. And then the balance is made up of investments in our gas system to further decarbonize. And so those are the important pieces. When we think about our -- on slide 22, specifically, and the investments there. Right now, our integrated resource plan is a 50/50 split between purchase power agreement and build, own, transfer. Now, because there are -- our renewable energy plan commitments, and we're building that wind to support that, so it's greater than 50/50. But let's talk about the 50/50 for a minute. All those PPAs, we are one of the few in the industry, and certainly leader in the industry to get a financial compensation mechanism associated with that. And the rest come through build, own, transfer. Now, as we think about our second IRP, we're going to take a strong look at what that mix looks like. And so that will be for the future. And so that will be something we explore and grow and certainly will be part of our integrated resource plan for the future. Now, I'm go to pass it over to Rejji too, because I know he has some additional thoughts to offer on this as well. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick. Jeremy, the only thing I would offer in addition to Garrick's good comments. And I don't know if this is an additional part of your question. But all of the capital spend that we have highlighted on this call, so the $13.2 billion and the $2.4 billion of clean energy at generation we see on 22 -- on page 22. This is all for the regulated utility consumers energy. So all of the capital investment we're talking about is earmarked for the regulated utility. Jeremy Tonet : That's very helpful. Thank you for clarifying that. And just want to turn to the balance sheet a little bit there, I guess, that see the equity, you talked about stepped up a little bit there on up to 250. And just wondering if you might be able provide more color, if that kind of ratable across years? Or if that could be kind of more or less in a given year. And there's really the driver there just kind of step up in CapEx this year? Or any other color you could provide there would be great? Rejji Hayes : Jeremy. I say, starting with the second part of your question first, it really is a ratable increase with the capital investment plan, which obviously has increased by a $1 billion vintage over vintage. And so, because of the capital plan and as utility increased by a $1 billion, we've had the equity needs increase roughly commensurate with that. And so the prior plan as you know, it's about $150 million per year run rate. And now we're at $250 million. Now, when you think about that distribution over the next five years, well, we may be opportunistic, and some years, it may be around $250, some years little less, we'll look at where the market is and how receptive it is to our currency. And we'll look at the price to stock, obviously. And I will just add. The first $250 million that we're planning to do in 2021, we've already taken about 20% of that pricing risk off the table affords [ph] we executed in the back half of 2020. And so we'll be opportunistic. So I wouldn't say it's going to be a clean $250 each year, but that's the target. And then, some years a little more, some years will less. And so when I say a little more, up to $250 to ceiling and maybe in some years be less than that, just to be very clear. Jeremy Tonet : That's super helpful. I'll stop there. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thanks. Operator : And our next question today comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning and congrats on this [Indiscernible]. It's actually Constantine here for Shahriar. Garrick Rochow : Hi, Constantine. Unidentified Analyst : Hey. Just a quick one on kind of the clean energy mix for CMS. You've outlined some reductions in kind of coal and rate base and Campbell's obviously still a decade away. Without kind of jumping into the IRP, obviously, can you kind of talk about kind of the opportunity to move the retirements ahead? And any thresholds that you kind of envision for kind of moving those dates around, especially as replacement economics start to improve for that power? Garrick Rochow : Yes. Thanks for your question. We're in the process of our integrated resource plan, I call it 2.0 or Rev 2, looking at that, and so right now -- and maybe even take a step back. Over the course of my career, we had 12 coal plants, we're down to our remaining five, Karn 1 and Karn 2, IRP 1.0 retirement of 2023. And right now, in this IRP, for 2.0, we're looking at the potential for early acceleration, early retirement for Campbell 1 and 2. Right now, their date is 2031, and evaluating whether that pulls forward or not. And so, that modeling is underway. there are a number of things we look at in that modeling. We're looking at the reliability of the grid, looking at the impact of coworkers obviously benefit the plan, but also the balance sheet. And what's the remaining book value, securitisation impact, and how does that play on the credit metrics? And what is the capital build out? There's a variety of variables that go into that. But that is certainly something that's under consideration. Also, we put that in the context of what's going on with the Biden administration and some of the ambitions around that from the plan perspective, which we support. And so that also factors into our thinking on our coal plants. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. That's very good color. And just shifting a little bit to kind of planning assumptions and low growth. So you -- and 2020 was obviously a little bit of a volatile year, just in terms of kind of shifts in the mix. And in your plan kind of Rejji mentioned that you're kind of going back to normal by the end of 2021. Do you anticipate kind of residential load trends that play out similar to kind of how they have been, and in general, they're being a little bit higher. And how does that impact kind the need for in flex, and then 2021, as you're starting the recovery, the kind of reset to the to the baseline, or their more return to normal and then profile by the tail end of the year? Garrick Rochow : Well, I start off with the big picture, which is slide 16. And every year, when there's work to do, we get after it, and we flex our CE WAY muscle and find savings opportunities, and then we reinvest it. And so, again, we've positioned well for 2021. That's the broad message, I mean, specifically from a sales perspective. Residential sales, as we talked in Q3, and still here in Q4 are a bit sticky, as people are working from home, and many schools are still virtual. But as we see this pandemic playing out, we anticipate that those will decline, as you might expect as people go back to the traditional workplace. And as kids return to school. Also, we expect the commercial sales to grow a little bit. Restaurants have been opened up here recently, some limited capacity, but those will continue to grow, particularly as vaccines is more readily available and distributed across Michigan. And so, again, there's not aggressive assumptions in there. It's very conservative assumptions, as you might expect from us, and really returning to some pre-pandemic levels, just as we shared. From an O&M flex perspective, as I shared earlier, we feel like we're well positioned for 2021. We've done a lot of reinvestment for our customers at the end of the year toward to the tune of $0.18, that only helps our customers and provides benefit, but it de risks 2021. Now, the weather could be mild in the winter, it could be a cool summer and there's still pandemic out there, but rest assured what we do each and every year is we don't reset, we don't carve out. We get after it and we flex that CE WAY muscle and deliver. And so, no matter what the year throw at us, I'm prepared, we're prepared as a team, and I'm confident in the guidance we've provided. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, Garrick. That was wonderful. I'll jump back in queue. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hi, good morning, guys. Garrick Rochow : Hi, Michael. Michael Weinstein : Hey. Just thinking about the IRP filings come up. Does the $250 million of equity already contemplate sort of the range of possible things that you've thinking of in that filing? Or should we expect to see some changes to that equity needs as a result of the plan? Rejji Hayes : Yes, Michael, this is Rejji. I'll just say that the equity issuance means that we have laid out our reflective of $13.2 billion capital plan. And then had some IRP-related capital investments, with I think, is remember, we're still executing on the first tranche of the 1.1 gigawatts of solar that were provided and the IRP that was approved in June of 19. And so there's some of that into the outer years of this plan. And so that's what that equity will support. We have not been too speculative as to what will come out of IRP, we have 2.0, and we'll see where the outcomes take us. But remember, it's a 10-month, potentially 12-month process. So if we file in mid 2021, as planned, we'll get an outcome around mid 2022. And that's a three-year board approval. So, my sense is, you'll see more of the results of that reflected in the next vintage of our five-year plan, which will roll out obviously in Q1 of next year. So for now, we're comfortable with a $250 million per year of equity funding this $13.2 billion plan. Michael Weinstein : Makes sense. And it's an approval that comes out of this three years, right? Is there -- could you comment a little bit about the appetite in Michigan, or the legality in Michigan of a multi year type settlement for rates, the coincide with an IRP of three years? And I'm just wondering if there's any possibility there? And also the appetite of the company flag kind of thing. I know that in the past, you guys have been very happy with the way the annual rate case. Just wondering what the prospects are for something like that? Garrick Rochow : We're still -- our approach is still to go with an annual rate case approach for a couple of reasons. One, as we work our CE WAY and we find opportunities for savings, it provides opportunity to give that back to our customers. And that creates headroom, which allows for our aggressive capital investment plans. And so that's the strategy that works for us. It works for our commission, continue on that path for some time. Michael Weinstein : Right. There's nothing legally. It's not legally blocking that type of outcome, though, right? I mean, it allowed Michigan to have a multi year plan? Garrick Rochow : No. There's nothing legally that's blocking it. And we've explored it at times. And again, we feel this is the best option for our strategy, the annual rate case. Michael Weinstein : Okay. Thank you very much. That's all I got. Operator : Our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the opportunity. And congrats, Garrick. I wanted to follow up here on the question on the IRP and weaving that into the CapEx update here. And I know, listen, we're pretty early on, but I wanted to understand, clearly, if you look at the slide, your -- shall we say, remaining large coal plant on Campbell, you've already shifted a little bit some of the timeline here. Would you say that next year, we could get an update on the five-year plan? Obviously, there's one larger plant that's out there, it's got a pretty long dated retirement. Is there a chance that we could see that in the five-year window? And could that impact the five year CapEx? I just want to clarify. And then also, can you clarify, I know you guys are raising CapEx here on clean energy, I just want to make sure that does not contemplate anything about any IRP outcomes to be extra clear about that? Garrick Rochow : Julien, thanks for your question. I think it's going to feel like a little bit of a reiteration for me on this answer, but we got an aggressive plan. It's net zero by 2040. And, obviously, we're looking at the potential to accelerate part of that plan with Campbell 1 and 2, as part of this plan. But we're also in the broader context of the Biden administration in the 2035. And even our Governor's goals within the State of Michigan, we're also considering what does that mean, and what does that look like? And so right now, Campbell 3 at 2039. And so, we will continue to take a look at what it means for Campbell 3. But again, there's a ton of analysis that needs to go into this. I mean, in addition to what I shared earlier, we're looking at what is the cost of renewables out in the future. We want to feather in those renewables over time to take advantage of the cost as those cost come down. We want to take a look at storage. Right now, storage is not at the right price. And so how does this storage come in? How do we feed into that in over time. Because if we go too fast in this, there's going to be risk from a reliability perspective. And frankly, when you get out to the end part of that plan it counts on that last 8%. It counts on technology in terms of carbon -- capturing carbon sequestration they makeup with the balance. And so, important part of this is making sure that we also not only be carbonized, but we ensure affordability, and we ensure the reliability on both affordability. And I think we can answer all three. It's just that we have to pace it and allow technology. And so, when it comes to the Biden administration not only with CMS but our industry will pushing for more R&D and more technology advancements, to be able to have the aspirations and meet the aspirations that the new administration is putting out, which frankly we support from a planet perspective. And I'll offer than in terms of plan. And I know Rejji had some thoughts on this too. So Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Yes. Julien, the only thing I add is, there are two old things. Or a couple of old things with respect to the CMS story over time, and they both through CE WAY and Garrick, but they still are true to this day one. We plan conservative and no big bets. And so, in this plan, we've rolled out, we have not made any major presumptions around what will be an IRP 2.0. And so that's not flowing through this 2021 through 2025 plan. And in fact the components as Garrick highlights really, you got little bit, call it, just south of $400 million of RPS related spend that's just still taking through for some of the wind investments that we're making. About a $1.5 billion related to the IRP. And again, it's just execution on the solar, just add another year. And then Ludington on the hydro side, which Garrick again mentioned earlier. So this is all just incremental blocking, and tackling. Again, we do not swing for the fences when it comes to financial planning. And when it comes to regulatory approaches, we just do not make big bets. So it's a very conservative plan, and we think it's highly executable. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: got excellent. Maybe Rejji, if I can stick with you super quick. Clarify this from your earlier comments and apologies, I misheard. What the order of magnitude or the range that's associated with the residential sales? Rejji Hayes : We have a sensitivities, Julien, as you know, on slide 18, if memory serves me. And so you can see what incremental residential would look like. And we've shown an annual basis. And it changes a little bit each year with regulatory outcomes. But a 1% change in the context of 2021 is worth about $0.04 per share on an annualized basis. And we're assuming fairly conservatively, as Garrick mentioned, that we'll get pretty close to pre pandemic residential around mid year. And so we're showing just year over year, little bit of a decline in residential again, ticking back to pre pandemic levels. So if we're -- if there's a percent -- if there's surprised to the upside to the tune of a percent, that's worth about $0.04 per share on an annualized basis. And I'll let your modeling assumptions go where they will, but that's generally the sensitivity. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right? Okay. Excellent. So 1% is kind of the order of magnitude and sensitivity. Rejji Hayes : Well, no. To be clear, that's the sensitivity. I wouldn't offer any ceiling for you as to where that could go. Because as we said in the past, the mass teleworking trend that may not -- I don't think that's going to be a fad. I think a number of companies have said very publicly, and we've heard also offline anecdotally that a number of companies are going to sustain some level of mass teleworking going forward. Now again, we plan conservatively. So we're assuming you have that traditional negative correlation whereas C&I comes back, you start to see residential come back down as to regard to the workforce, but there's a good chance that we could see. Who knows 1%, 2% of upside. So again, I don't want to cap you. I just want to give you the sensitivity there. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you, Garrick. Best of luck guys. Rejji Hayes : Thanks. Operator : And the next question today, comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey. Good morning team. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one tactical one real quick. Rejji, just can you clarify. You mentioned some rating agency adjustments to FFO order bet. What exactly are those? And, I mean, I guess, is it the presentation change or what you were trying to convey there? Rejji Hayes : Yes. Sure, Durgesh. So as you know, both Moody's and S&P and Fitch, sorry, not both, but all three rating agencies have tailored computations as it pertains to FFO to debt. So, for example, now Moody's ascribed to different level of equity credit for hybrids we've been issuing those. S&P adds PPAs as parts of debt, Moody's includes securitization. So they all have their sort of bespoke ways in which they calculate FFO to debt. And so what we're trying to highlight in our current guidance is that we're trying to show those tailored computation so that we can maintain a solid investment grade credit rating. That we've historically targeting. So that kind of takes you to a mid teens level. I think historically, just to keep it simple, we've shown it on unadjusted basis, which gets you closer to the high-teens. But we wanted to reflect the reality of what those tailored computations will lead you to. And so that's what we're effectively doing. Durgesh Chopra : I see. Okay. So its no change to the absolute forecast number. It just the adjustments, all the credit rating agencies make and you sort of want to show that as relative to the bar? Or sort of the metric that hold you accountable too? Garrick Rochow : That's exactly right. So our philosophy has not changed at all. We want to maintain solid investment grade credit ratings and we think that mid-teens that afforded debt level again, I'll be tailored for rating agency should to stay there. Durgesh Chopra : Excellent. Okay. Thank you. Then just maybe just quick one for you, Garrick. And maybe not so quick, but just coming out of the EICO [ph] meeting I didn't get a chance to catch up with you. But just any thoughts that you can share yours or other industry leaders on the legislation front. What come down from the Biden administration. What might had look like? What might the timeline look like? Just any color there would be appreciated? Garrick Rochow : Yes. Thanks for your question, Durgesh. So I had the opportunity to listen two industry events, separate industry event, John Kerry, who is part of the Biden administration and for the climate envoy, as well as the Gina McCarthy, is also part of the Biden administration here engage in the planet ambitions. Furthermore, our relationship with former Governor Granholm and now likely lead at the Department of Energy here shortly. So it gives us a good context around some of these emissions. And what we've heard clearly is from and net zero perspective for all sectors by 2025, I mean, 2050, and for the electric sector by 2035, from a net zero perspective. And, John Kerry was specific to say that it was an all in approach. And that also these ambitious -- these ambitious goals. But again, it was going to be about R&D type development and technology development to move it forward. And then he also offered the thought. This was not a regulatory approach, because that takes too long, and it would be incentives based on the market to spur and increase the market. And so, I believe we're well positioned for that. Again, where we stood at 2040 to 2035, we can do that. But again, the important piece, really from an industry perspective is that we maintain the affordability, reliability, and decarbonization, all three of those can be addressed. And it's going to require more R&D from a federal policy perspective. And so that when we develop the technology, but it also moves at scale, so we can get the economics of it for all our customers. And so that's an important piece. And we'll be leaning in from an industry perspective to shape that. Thanks for your question. Durgesh Chopra : Excellent. Thank you. Appreciate the time. Operator : And our next question today comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Andrew Weisel : Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question on the O&Ms. So the $100 million or so that you identified in 2020 was extremely impressive. Now that the year is closed, how are you thinking about that in terms of sustainability of that $100 million? As a follow up in the waterfall on page 15, can you just take a little further into the negative $0.27 of higher costs, as far as how much of that is built into the new rates, and how much is what I would call your typical annual CE WAY cost savings? Rejji Hayes : Yes. So from a from $100 million challenge in our work, they're very successful, really over $100 million, very successful year, about 50% of that I put in the category of sustainable. So let me talk about kind of the both buckets. And so obviously, there's been some just changing the way we do business this year. We're not flying places. We will go back and we'll do those things right, as part of the business. But through the CE WAY we've done 50% of it is clearly sustainable. And there are a number of actions that we've taken, which will continue to provide savings for our customers and create headroom as we go forward. I want to give you an example. And this is a longer term one. But there was also a value that was seen here in 2020. So if I go back to 2015, we still have about 6 million calls in our call center, our contact center. In 2017 here, or I'm in 2020 here we did 2.7 million calls, drop a 3 million calls over that time period, you know, it's roughly $3 a call. And so I'll just give you one real example of the work and it speaks to the empowerment. What is unique is that we empower our coworkers to do this. And so some people still pay by calling in and dialing in and put in their credit card information. That's a subset of our customers. That team took that process, took 24 steps out of the process, moved it from 405 seconds to 305 seconds. And so, as you imagine a customer who wants to pay that way, the more steps they have, the longer it takes, the more they get frustrated, it turns into a defect that goes over to our call center. So that's just one example of how we've improved the process, made it better for our customers, made it better for our coworkers. And then the cost falls out of that. And that's small. But imagine, multiplying that by 8500 people that are doing that type, because they're empowered, that's the unique piece. And so that's pay, right? We're not going to go back and make that experience worse for our customers. That's the type of cost savings opportunities, I can go through hundreds of them. And in fact, we have delivered on hundreds, and they will continue to live on hundreds of them. And so that's how I think about it. And there's more opportunity across our company to deliver on excellence from the CE WAY. Now to your question, we were very successful in the midst of a pandemic. And I think it speaks to our regulatory construct and getting gas settlement in 2020, and electric rate case. And so, as we look at for test years, and we look at the work we're underway, we've got recovery in place. And so when you see that uptick in O&M, much of that's for improved customer service. We increase, and it was, awarded through the electric rate case outcome in December, our forestry work, or tree trimming work which is the number one cause of outages, we increased it by $30 million. And so that's already recovered. And we're going forward with that work to improve customer service, for all our customers. That's just one example of the increase that you note there. But again, big picture perspective, there's more opportunity, we continue to improve the way we do business, excellent to the CE WAY. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Then one on the heating season and bills, obviously, gas prices are up, you've got this bad economy? Can you give us an update on what you're seeing from customers in terms of their ability to pay their bills? And I'm sure it's always a concern, but how does it compare now versus in past seasons? And maybe if you could dig a little deeper into some of the programs that you've got to help your -- to help support the customers in need? Garrick Rochow : Yes. This has been one of our biggest years in support for our customer. So let me talk about the numbers. So when I look at current to 30 days, right now, our customer -- 87% of our customers are in that bucket, in current 30 days. That compares with 2019, which was 88% in 2017 -- I'm sorry, 2018, which was 89%. And so there is an impact there. But as you see, it's pretty light in terms of what is kind of from historical receivables to 30 days. And so -- and really, we believe that's by design. One, we've worked closely with the commissioners and made sure that one, we didn't have a mandatory moratorium shut offs. It's been a voluntary. We work closely with Commission to do that. We put invested a number of dollars in both payment forgiveness as well as foundation help, specifically $15 million in 2020. We put another $24 million into our foundation, which is also started to provide some of that benefit in 2021. And so, we continue to increase that work. In fact, I was on the phone with the Attorney General's office this week. And we're looking at how can we work together on this issue to do even more in 2021. And so there are a variety of ways we've helped out those particularly in need during this time. And we will continue through particularly around Michigan, because we are in the midst of this pandemic. But I think there is a lot of bright things that are occurring both from a COVID perspective, but also Michigan's economy perspective. One, we got great distribution of the vaccine. And if you look at our numbers, the State of Michigan has improved in that performance. And so we've seen restaurants open. We've seen this movement of kids going back to school. That's already underway. But I even take a bigger picture perspective and look at some of the economic things that I've seen here in Michigan. I sit on two economic development boards, 126 megawatts of new load, $2.5 billion of investment for 4000 new jobs. That's not just a highlight from this year. If I look back in the last three to four years, it's been very similar to that. And if you go to a place like Kalamazoo, Michigan, Kalamazoo Michigan, this is where they manufacturing the vaccine of Pfizer. That place is going gangbusters. And all the industries that support that are going gangbusters. Many people paint us as the automotive state. We truly have an automotive background, which is risk rich. But we're one of the leading states in the growth of life sciences, like we see at Pfizer and other place. And so, although we're in the midst of a pandemic, and they're certainly we need to be sensitive about those that are low income and are working through that, and we're doing our efforts there. I'm also optimistic about what Michigan offers in the growth that I've seen here over the last four or five years. Andrew Weisel : Alright. That sounds great. If I could squeeze one last on just to confirm. You roll forward the five-year CapEx. But the 10-year plan of $25 billion with three to four upside that's just a reiteration, right? That's not meant to be a roll forward. Am I right? That won't be updated until after the IRP is done in a year and a half or so? Garrick Rochow : That's correct. It's $25 billion with $3 billion to $4 billion opportunity. And if there's events that warrant it we'll make adjustments. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller : Thank you. Good morning. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Travis. Travis Miller : When you look at the rate case outcome from last year, what are some of the pluses and minuses that you saw in the winds or losses that you might want to address in the next. I know you're not going to need any specifics, but general pluses and minuses that you may want to address next year or this year rather? Garrick Rochow : Well, one thing I spoke to the forestry outcome, that's going to be an great improvement. And again, the number one cause of outages in our state is tree trimming. And so that's a big, big lift. We've done a lot of great work on electric capital. And we made a great case and received a good portion of our electric capital investments that will prepare the grid for the future from a renewable perspective, as well as also improve reliability on the electric grid. We got some good outcomes in a distributed generation. And our approach to that which reduces the subsidy that is paid from our customers. In furthermore, we haven't spoke much about electric vehicles, but our powerMIFleet, which is where I think there's a great opportunity in electric vehicles, that's a space where we got approval for. And so -- and there's a whole host of other positives that would offer in there. From an opportunity perspective, we do see this as an opportunity perspective. We can do more work to justify our capital plans, particularly from a facilities perspective and a fleet perspective. We're a little short of our expectations there. And that's an area where we can build out better business cases and get better outcomes. I also think there's a better opportunity to have our commission not go look at historical five-year IT, because when IT and what we invest in that work, with how fast that is changing, when you do a historical, look, it doesn't provide the right amount of O&M you need. And so, there's more work we need to do with our staff, with the staff at the MPSC and with the commission to make a better case for O&M related to IT investments. And so those are a couple examples of things that we need to strengthen. And I'll pass it over Rejji. I know Rejji has some thoughts as well. Rejji Hayes : Yes, Travis. The only thing I would add to Garrick's good comments is that, we did see any electric rate case modest degradation in equity thickness. And so, when you take into account the deferred tax go back. Its only about 40 basis point of rate making equity thickness reductions. So modest level of degradation. But at the end of the day, we're still now two, three years, beyond tax reform, and the balance sheet and cash flow generative effects of tax reform are very real. And so we would like to see that equity thickness, it create some to offset the effects of that. And so, again, to Garrick's point, the onus is on us to continue to make the compelling case that equity thickness at work should stay where it is today, but ideally accrete some time we've seen other jurisdictions do that. So we'll try to make that case better in subsequent cases. Travis Miller : Okay. That's, that's great. Appreciate that. And then real quick, you mentioned the EV program. We're thinking about a scale, let's say EV sales doubled over the assumptions that are in that -- in your program. What kind of CapEx does that mean? Is it minimal? Is a lot kind of think about that scale on the EV? Garrick Rochow : So what I'd offer, and I mean, this is really a preliminary piece here. We have nice scalable programs on the fleet side and the residential side that are continue to grow as electric vehicle grows. And I'd put up a level out there about 150 just as an early marker. And I think what is the important key about this fleet. And I'm really excited about what came out of the electric rate case, because we're going to offer a concierge service to help businesses make the choice. That'll be a big difference and how this moves. Because some of these fleets when you have to expand by two to three to four megawatts, you're talking about transformers and substations and other upgrades associated with that. And so, depending on the fleet mix is really -- it's an important variable, I'm figuring out what that capital build out looks like. As GM announced here, it was about a week and a half ago, there's a inflection point between when it makes sense to be an electric vehicle fleet for some of your trucking versus going to hydrogen. And I think that point, right there is an important point that we need to understand a bit more. And we're working to do that. And that's the importance of this fleet program we got in the last electric rate case. And we'll see more on that grow and be able to better pinpoint our capital investment opportunities. And Rejji, go ahead on that one, and we got more to add. Rejji Hayes : The only thing I would add is just -- it also just depends on customer or end user behavior at the end of the day as well. And so part of the power Michigan drive program that we put in place. An element of that is really to educate customers on when to charge. And ideally charging off peak to get better utilization out of the existing assets. And there are economic incentive that were trying provide as part of that. But if EV owners feel compelled, and this is more on the residential side to charge during peak periods. Well, that could have implications on the electric infrastructure as well as supply needs, that we may have, which would have a direct impact on capital. And so again, we've talked a lot about shaving the peak. And so, even though that may lead to additional capital investment opportunities, we think that's suboptimal in terms of where to put the best dollar longer term. And so I think a lot of this will also be dictated on EV owner behavior. Travis Miller : Okay, great. That's very helpful. I appreciate all the thoughts. Garrick Rochow : Thanks for your question, Travis. Operator : And our next question today comes from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Fishman : Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me here. Garrick Rochow : Thanks David. David Fishman : So we've talked a little bit about the renewable on the electric side. But I'm just curious little bit for more color on the net zero methane by 2030 on the natural gas kind of size of business how CMS needs to invest to achieve that kind of rapid level decarbonization on the gas side? Is that seems kind of like over the past three years to five-year plans more or less been around $5 billion. Now little bit more this time than the 10-year plans around $10 billion with little bit upside. But is that the run rate you needs in order to get to reach net zero by 2030 with some RNG mixed in. Or is it something else that maybe we should be looking for that might lead to accelerating reduction in methane over time whether in the first five or next five years? Garrick Rochow : I love this question, David. Next week and this coming week and I should say, the next couple day, its going to be zero and negative one and one here in Michigan. And I have electric key pump at home. And I'll tell you what. It does not keep up. And so, I've got a supplement with gas to be able to keep my house warm. And in fact 75% of Michigan's resident count on natural gas. And so I'm so glad you ask that question. Because I think its really important when we think decarbonization, we're thinking not only about the electric but the gas business. And that's exactly what we're doing. And so, we do have a 10-year plan, as you pointed out to get to net zero by 2030. These investments which are represented in our five-year plan, and those in our 10-year, which will have the opportunity to grow, as we move forward, are exactly what delivers that net zero. We invest in taking out old metal and old materials out there, we replace it with plastic across our distribution system, which provides for safety that is so critical in our gas business. And we continue to maintain reliability, affordability, and decarbonization, because you can do all across that. Also, within that plan, you add a little bit of renewable natural gas, we have some on our system, we're going to add a little bit more renewable, natural gas that'll help to decarbonize that stream. That will get us to net zero methane by 2030. I'll tell you what, there's more opportunity to decarbonized natural gas. We've got energy efficiency programs that we have ran for 10 plus years, which are great. It's a win for our customers, saves them money. We get an incentive on it. It helps the plant all the above win win win. We have the ability to expand those programs on our gas business. And you can think about the technology in home envelope equipment. And we spent a lot. I won't go through them all now because I'm getting away from your questions. But yes, that investments spin right there. And we have a little bit more opportunity in future cases will we even there will deliver a net-net thing 2030 target. David Fishman : Got it. Thank you very helpful. And just one quick follow up on that one. So the RNG that you'd be adding into the system that just mostly be tariff based, right? You would just pretty much be taking RNG sources that are kind of separately owned and maybe adding an additional charge associated with the RNG kind of whenever it's just the customers? Or how would that work with the ownership and kind of supply dynamic? Garrick Rochow : Yes. So we'd like to put it on our system and have it be part of our gas supply cost recovery efforts there. And that'll be work we'll do. We've got some on our system, but as we add more we'll look at different opportunities. I think there's opportunities to think about individual customers who have a specific renewable natural gas need as part of their sustainability targets. And so I think there's customer programs we would consider as well. David Fishman : Yes. And then just one more quick if I can on regulation. I think it's part of the last electric rate case, the MPSC had mentioned looking at performance based metrics for performance based rate making I know, obviously, you have some relate to renewables right now. But I was just curious what you think that the commission is looking for there, and maybe you just had any color on what performance based ratemaking could look like in the future in Michigan? Garrick Rochow : Yes. The work that you're referencing that in the Michigan power grid. There are a number of activities and actions are looking at everything from interconnections to what it means to achieve net zero by 2050, that's our Governor's goal is the carbon neutrality by 2050. And so there are a variety of things that they're taking a look at. And so it's not -- part of it is performance based ratemaking. But I would offer this to our commission and staff continue to be very thoughtful in their approach. And for example, some of it is just frankly, updating. One of the things that's part of our performance metrics we already have in place, is average speed of answer. That's a call center metric. Most of our communications and most of our activity as I shared with you earlier are digital in nature. And so to measure average speed of answer in today's time period, it's not really relevant. And so part of this too, is a thoughtful updating wells to and getting the land around those. And so, again, it's still in development. That's currently where we are, and I believe our commission and regulatory construct will continue to be thoughtful in that approach. David Fishman : And I guess, just with that example, the idea would be potentially every rate case or every set of rate cases, maybe you'd have kind of a target for average speed of answer as a metric. And you just be gauged against that, and you might have an incentive or penalty associated with that? Garrick Rochow : Well, we already have average speed of answer. That's already a performance metric, which we work with and we measure our performance too and work with staff and the commission on. And so, right now, it's really too soon to tell. I mean, this power grid work and the work that's going on is -- there's a lot of avenues of this and it's just -- there's more groups that are underway. We simply don't know what it looks like from a performance based rate making perspective. David Fishman : Okay. Thank you very much for your time. Appreciate it. Congrats on a great here. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Hey, good morning, guys. How you doing? Garrick Rochow : I'm doing well, Paul. Thank you. Paul Patterson : So some really quick book emptier. On Interbank and I apologize that I missed this. The $0.02 increase in the fourth quarter. Was there anything in particular there that happened? Rejji Hayes : Yes, Paul, this is Rejji. Now they just kind of story throughout 2020 of them just executing and delivering. So loan origination volumes are often we saw that basically, after that brief pause for March and April origination slowed down a little bit in the nascent stages of pandemic, but then they just executed and delivered throughout the year. So that's what's reflected in that$0.02 uptick. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. And then on slide eight. So there's estimated cost savings. I just wanted to touch base on what they sort of represent. So I can see with Karn and Campbell, it's adjusted O&M savings. But I don't -- I'm not really clear on policies and I'm just wondering also since securitization of like $126 million, I think that was estimated by the Commission. And I wanted to sort of get a sense as to why those aren't being included, if you know what I mean? Garrick Rochow : Yes. I can take those. So with respect to the PPA related savings. To give you the quick answer both Palisades and MCV, when you look at energy and capacity, they're both priced around $55 to $60 per megawatt hour. And so, we looked at that relative to replacement costs. And so for palisade specifically, that is worth about $90 million run rate per year. MCV is a bit more nuanced. That's more just the fact that the capacity price embedded in the contract steps down, post 2025. It effectively cuts in half, and that's worth about $50 million. So that's the essence of the savings there for those two. Now, with respect to securitization, I just want to make sure I understand the spirit of where you're going. Is that with respect to when we tried to terminate Palisades early a few years ago, or 126, I just want to make sure what you're referencing there? Paul Patterson : Well, there was a securitization order for about $680 -- $690 million or something where you guys got in December. And I think $126 million was basically -- was what they basically saw was -- was what they basically thought was the savings that they called out as being the savings in it. I guess, I'm wondering is, it seems like they might maybe some stuff in the coal as well, that you guys aren't adding in there. And I'm just wondering why you're not calling those out? Rejji Hayes : Are you going? Okay, so you're correct about the December securitization order of about $608 million to be very clear, that was specifically related to Karn 1 and 2. And so what we've enumerated on page eight are the O&M related savings that we have quantified. There could be additional savings above and beyond that we have good experiences, you know, closing cold facilities. So we obviously did the Classic Seven and 2016. And based on that history, that's what we've come up with a 30 million, if there are additional savings potential in the fuel side or otherwise, we'll obviously realize that upside to the benefit of costumers and investors, but for now, we're just reflecting the O&M savings at Karn 1 and 2. And the securitization order that we got in December solely related to that closure. Paul Patterson : Are these annual numbers or\u2026? Rejji Hayes : These are run rate. So we don't anticipate these being just one time or episodic. I mean, the events themselves are episodic, but we expect these to be ongoing. Paul Patterson : And so just observe the flow on this. It looks like this, maybe considerably more savings that you guys might be getting from this. I mean, this seems conservative, these cold savings that you're that you're bringing up, I mean, so that obviously will go back to customers. But am I correct in that? Rejji Hayes : Well, a couple things. So we always plan conservative for sure. And remember, this is just related to these events. So the Palisades retirement, the Karn facilities, the Campbell 1 and 2 potential in 2031, as well as MCV. This excludes all the CE WAY related savings. So $200 million is not the extent of our ambitions. That is solely the quantification of these amounts that are enumerated in the slide. We certainly think we can do more. And if there are additional savings within these items enumerated on page eight, we'll realize them where we come when they arrive. But again, you know our style, we are very conservative and how we go about our business. And we'd rather, I'll say deliver and surprise to the upside than the downside. Paul Patterson : Awesome. Thanks so much, guys. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Sophie Karp with Keybanc. Please go ahead. Sophie Karp : Hi, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. So most of the questions have been answered. I guess, I don't want to beat the dead horse on equity and so on. But just maybe if I made a quick follow up on pensions. You mentioned that the plans fully funded. I think the market action helped that a lot in 2020. How does -- how do you contemplate the I guess, the potential contributions over the next five years during the grant period? And how does that factor into your equity needs and just general budget? Thank you. Garrick Rochow : Yes, Sophie. Appreciate the question. And I thank you for the opportunity for us to really promote our activities over the last, not just last year, but a couple of years where similar to our mindset around flexing up on the income statement side. We also choose to flex up on the operating cash flow side. And last year, we saw pretty good upside largely driven by cost performance, a little bit from the Cares Act that allowed us to have some upside on OCF. And so we took the liberty to put about $700 million to work in discretionary pension contributions, most of which were in January of last year, but we did a good portion late in Q4. And that's allowed us to fully fund the pension. And so where we sit today, we don't anticipate certainly not any -- we certainly don't anticipate any involuntary contributions. And I think if there are any embedded in the five-year plan, I would say, they're relatively de minimis. And so, where we sit today, we think there should be really like contribution requirements over the next five years. And then, clearly there are variables. So if you're seeing discount rates come down. If you see asset performance underwhelmed or under performed that could require additional contributions. So where we sit today, we feel good about the lack, where limited amount of contributions over the courses five-year plan. So there's no real material impact embedded in our equity issuance assumptions. But again, these variables toggle and we have recalibrate every year. So we'll see what the fact pattern looks like over the next couple of year. Is that that helpful. Sophie Karp : Yes. Its super helpful. Thank you. And then, one last one if I may squeeze it in, but very quick. Your OCF guidance is down versus 2019 -- 2020 not by loss but like about $120 million, $130 million I would say. So, is the rate where you got most recently during the COVID kind of situation is primary driver of that? Or is it something else that I'm missing here? Rejji Hayes : Yes. So let me offer this, just to be very clear, Sophie. So, what we have done and this precedes me and Garrick. It's just been a long standing standard we've had from an financial planning perspective for OCF is, we have not unlike on the income statement an EPS. We have not guided OCF off of the prior year actuals. We have just looked at the budget or the guidance we provided from prior year. And we said, directionally we'll increase by $100 million each year off the prior year's guidance. And so, for example, last year we guided to $1.75 billion, obviously we delivered well in excess of that. And then this year again, a $100 million above and beyond that $125 billion. So yes, that is down from what actuals were, which was just under $2 billion. And again, a lot of that has to do with the cost performance as well as against some CARES Act related benefit. And so, I wouldn't view that as conservatism or just any type of rate or regulatory related actions that you just touched again just thinking about annual growth that we can deliver from an OCF perspective. But we're seeing all in over the next five years. We're going to do over $10 billion of operation cash flow generation and that is in excess of what we were anticipating over five years from the prior vintage which I thing itself is $10 billion or around $10 billion. So we feel good about our ability to deliver. On operating cash flow and its not a result of any of the regulatory outcomes. I think the only think you'll see in the gas settlement is about $30 million, $35 million of operating cash flow challenge, because we're staying out. But again its relative de minimis in the grand scheme of things. Sophie Karp : Got it. Thank you. Very helpful. Appreciate it. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to Garrick Rochow for any final remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thanks Rocco. And I'd like to thanks everyone for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. I'll be back out on a virtual role shortly. And I look forward to connecting with you. I'm hoping we can meet face-to-face safely before the years over. Take care and be safe. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone and welcome to the CMS Energy First Quarter 2021 Results. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 p.m. Eastern Time, running through May 6. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Srikanth Maddipati : Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in CMS Energy. Over the past five months, I have been on the virtual road and have had the opportunity to meet with many of you to share our investment thesis, which delivers for all our stakeholders. This thesis is grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit and enables the excellence you have come to expect from CMS Energy. Many of you have asked what will change under my leadership. And I want to reemphasize, we've changed leadership not the simple proven investment thesis that delivers year in and year out. Looking forward, we are committed to leading the clean energy transformation with our net-zero carbon and methane emissions plans, which are supported by our clean energy investments in our current progressive integrated resource plan. Furthermore, we are recognized as top-tier for ESG performance earning top ratings amongst our peers. We continue to mature our industry-leading lean operating system, the CE Way, eliminating waste and improving our performance. I love this system. Over the past several years, we have used it across the business to drive efficiencies, improve employee engagement and deliver sustainable cost performance. I've seen it, I've worked it, and we have plenty of gas pedal left. Today, we are crafting the next horizon, what I call CE Way 2.0, which layers in greater use of automation and analytics and begins to position CMS Energy, as a leader in digital. Another key differentiator of CMS Energy is Michigan's top-tier regulatory construct that has 10-month forward-looking rate cases in constructive ROEs. This all leads to our adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% and combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. At CMS Energy, we wake up every day to get after it, deliver for our customers in all conditions, rain, snow, sleet wind. We never quit. And for you, our investors, we never quit. This year is no different. Now, let's get into the numbers. In the first quarter, we delivered $1.21 of adjusted earnings per share. This is up significantly, $0.35 from last year, primarily from incremental revenue to fund needed customer investments and sustained cost performance. As a reminder, our full-year dividend is $1.74, up 7% from last year. We are reaffirming our 2021 guidance for the year of $2.83 to $2.87 of adjusted earnings per share and our long-term earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8% with the bias to the midpoint. At CMS Energy, we are committed to our promises to our co-workers, the communities we serve, and our planet, as we are to delivering our financial commitments. During my discussions with many of you, the topic of ESG often comes up. I'm proud of our leadership in this space. We continue to enhance our commitments and our efforts are being recognized with top-tier ratings. We remain a AA-rated company by MSCI and have ranked top quartile for global utilities by Sustainalytics since 2013. This is a deep commitment that began well before it was a trend. Our commitments to net-zero methane emissions by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 are among the most aggressive in the industry. As our industry approach is a cleaner energy future, and we retire our legacy generating units, it is critical that we honor the contributions and service of our co-workers, as well as address the economic impact on those communities. Now, I began my career on the generation side of our business. I have walked the halls, climbed the stairs of every one of our generating plants, shaking hands, drink coffee with the men and women, who work every day to provide energy for our customers. And I'm proud of the honorable and equitable way we have cared for both our co-workers and our communities, as we retire these units from service. We built a playbook for success. It began with the retirement of our seven coal plants in 2016. That work will continue with the retirement of Karn 1 and 2 in 2023. Our leadership and track record in this space is something I'm proud of and we will continue as we look to the future. This ensures success for all stakeholders, including our investors. While many focus on the E of ESG, we have a strong record of delivering across all three. In my 20 years of service, I believe our culture has never been stronger. Every single day, our co-worker show up with a heart of service for our customers, our communities, and ultimately you, our investors. Our culture anchored by our values is thriving across our company and it's why we are recognized for top quartile safety performance, industry-leading employee engagement, Forbes Best Employer for Women, Best for Vets by Military Times and Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality in the Corporate Equality Index. And earlier this month, we were ranked by Forbes, as the number one utility in the country, as Best Employers for Diversity. Our leadership, commitment and top-tier ESG performance should provide you with the confidence that our long track record will continue to deliver value for customers and investors. Turning to recent updates. I want to highlight our continued growth in renewables with several exciting announcements. We are pleased to announce the recent commission approval of our Heartland Wind Project in March, which will be online in December of next year. This project adds 201 megawatts of new capacity, as a part of our renewable portfolio standard earning a 10.7% return. I'm also pleased to share that we received approval for the first tranche of our current Integrated Resource Plan, which adds nearly 300 megawatts of new solar through two projects that we expect to come online in 2022. We are evaluating the second tranche of our current IRP, another 300 megawatts of solar expected to come online in 2023. In the third tranche, 500 megawatts of solar expected to come online in 2024 for a total of 1,100 megawatts. We are on track to file our next Integrated Resource Plan in June. It has been a popular topic in our meetings with many of you, while we are still finalizing the details, the focus of our upcoming IRP will be to accelerate the decarbonization of our fleet, ensure reliability and affordability and add renewable and demand side resources in a way that makes sense for our customers and investors, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. And I'm excited for this next IRP. It serves as yet another proof point that we are leading the clean energy transformation. As part of our clean energy transformation \u2013 part of our clean energy transformation includes retirement of our remaining coal fleet. On Slide 7, you will see our plan to decarbonize as both visible and data-driven. The meaningful reduction of carbon emissions in our plan will drive our ability to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. Over the past few months, I've been asked quite a bit about the future of our gas business. As I've shared with many of you, our gas business and system is critical to providing affordable and reliable heating here in Michigan. But doesn't mean we're sitting on our tails here. In fact, we are actively working to decarbonize our gas system. Now this aligns very well with the recent announcement from the Biden administration. Our first step is to reduce fugitive methane emissions, which is well under way, as we accelerate the replacement of vintage mains and services, both plans approved by the commission will decrease our missions and achieve our net-zero methane goal. Our decarbonization plans also leverage energy efficiency to reduce carbon usage and put renewable natural gas on our system, which will help decarbonize most difficult sectors, such as agriculture. By replacing vintage mains and services with plastic piping, we will be positioned to deliver hydrogen or other clean molecules to our customers in the future. As we would grow our renewable portfolio and decarbonize our generation fleet and gas delivery system, we remain committed to delivering against the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. Before I turn the call over to Rejji, I want to end with this slide. It demonstrates our consistent industry-leading performance for nearly two decades. As much as things change, one thing stays consistent, year in and year out we have and we will continue to deliver. 2020 proved this. 2021 will be no different, marking 19 years of consistent, predictable financial performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we are pleased to report our first quarter results for 2021. In summary, we delivered adjusted net income of $348 million or $1.21 per share. For comparative purposes, our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.35 above our Q1 2020 results, largely driven by rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, better weather and sustained cost performance from our 2020 efforts at the utility. Our enterprises and parent and other segments were slightly down as planned due to the absence of a one-time cost reduction item in 2020 and higher funding related costs respectively. This modest negative variance was more than offset by strong origination growth at EnerBank, which exceeded its Q1 2020 EPS contribution by $0.06 in 2021 as planned and is tracking toward the high end of our guidance for the year of $0.22 per share. The waterfall chart on Slide 10 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020 and highlights our latest estimates for the major year-to-go drivers to meet our 2021 EPS guidance range. To elaborate on the year-to-date performance, while weather in the first quarter of 2020 has been below normal to-date, which has led to lower volumetric gas sales, it has been better than the historically warm winter weather experienced in the first quarter of 2020. And the absence of that weather has led to $0.08 per share of positive variance period-over-period. From a rates perspective, given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses, we are seeing $0.26 per share of positive variance. As a reminder, our rate relief estimates are stated net of investment-related costs, such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs. It is also worth noting that our 2021 financials reflect the accelerated amortization of deferred taxes, as part of our 2020 gas rate order settlement. On the cost side as noted during our fourth quarter earnings call, we budgeted substantial increases in our operating and maintenance expenses in 2021 versus the prior year to fund key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonization and in alignment with our recent rate orders. As you can see, we're $0.02 per share above our spend rate in the first quarter of 2020 as planned, and I'm pleased to report that we are seeing sustained cost performance from 2020, as well as increased productivity in 2021, largely attributable to the CE Way. That said, we do expect to see the bulk of the planned O&M increases to materialize later in the year. The balance of our year-to-date performance is driven by the aforementioned drivers at our non-utility segment and non-weather sales, which though slightly down at about 1% below the first quarter 2020 continue to exhibit favorable mix with the higher margin residential class, up 2% versus Q1 of 2020. And I'll remind you that our total electric sales exclude one large low margin customer. As we look ahead to the remaining nine months of 2021, we are cautiously optimistic about the glide path illustrated on this slide to achieve our full-year EPS guidance. As always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case translates to $0.12 per share of negative variance given the above normal weather experienced in the second and third quarters of 2020. The residual impact of the aforementioned rate relief, which equates to $0.22 per share of pickup and is not subject to any further MPSC actions. And the continued execution of our operational and customer-related projects, which we estimate as an incremental $0.18 per share of spend versus the comparable period in 2020. We have also assumed the usual conservatism in our utility non-weather sales and our non-utility segments. All in, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the remaining three quarters of 2021. And needless to say, we will be prepared to flex costs up or down as the fact pattern evolves over the course of the year. As we look out over the long-term, we are in the early stages of executing our $13.2 billion five-year customer investment plan at the utility, which is highlighted on Slide 11 and will provide significant benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our investors. As a reminder, we have budgeted over $2.5 billion of investments in 2021, the vast majority of which is earmarked for safety, reliability and clean energy projects. We are on track thus far, and recently filed an electric rate case in March that enumerate our customer investment priorities for the 2022 test year, which are summarized on the right hand side of the page among other key details related to the filing. We expect an order from the commission by the end of the year. Despite the substantial customer investments that we intend to make on our electric and gas system over the next several years, as you know we take great pride in taking out costs in a sustainable way to maintain affordable bills for our customers, and we have the track record to prove it. The left hand side of Slide 12 summarizes the key components of our cost structure, which we have successfully managed over the past several years, while investing significant capital on behalf of customers. In fact, from 2007 to 2019, we reduced utility bills, as a percentage of customer wallet by 1%, while investing roughly $19 billion of capital in the utility over that timeframe. As we look ahead, we have several highly actionable event-driven cost reduction opportunities, which will provide substantial savings in the years to come. The planned expiration of our Palisades power purchase agreement and the recently approved amendment to our MCV PPA will collectively generate roughly $150 million of power supply cost recovery savings. And as you'll note, our initial estimates for the potential savings for the MCV contract amendment of approximately $50 million proved conservative with the revised estimate of over $60 million in savings per the commission's order in March. Also the planned retirements of our five remaining coal unit should provide another $90 million of savings in aggregate, exclusive of any potential fuel cost savings, which will create meaningful headroom and bills for future customer investments. Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our annual O&M productivity delivered through the CE Way, which last year generated roughly $45 million of savings and serves as a critical tool to our long-term and intra-year financial planning. To that end, many of you've asked about proposed changes in corporate tax policy and its potential impact to our plan. Though at this point, the final details remain unclear, trust that we are evaluating the potential effects and we will leverage the CE Way and other cost reduction opportunities, including potential offsetting tax credits that are also being proposed, as part of the legislation to minimize the impact to customers, while executing our capital plan. As we've said before, it is our job to do the worrying for you, and we are uniquely positioned over the next several years to manage any potential headwinds. With our unparalleled track record on cost management, driven by our highly engaged workforce coupled with a robust customer investment backlog and top-tier regulatory construct, we are confident that we can deliver on our ambitious, operational, customer and financial objectives for the foreseeable future. And with that, we'll move to Q&A. So Rocco, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning. Quick one to Garrick. I appreciate the comments on the IRP, and you mentioned the sort of focus will be on accelerating decarbonization. Are you willing to sort of talk about how significant an acceleration you might sort of have in mind? Could we be talking about bringing net-zero sort of into that 2035 timeframe on electric, for example? Garrick Rochow : Well, thanks for your question, Jonathan. We've laid out those objectives and all of those objectives, I would just put them all is equally important. And so decarbonization is one, but so is reliability and affordability and the rest of them that are listed there within the deck. You'll recall from the settlement we had on our current Integrated Resource Plan in 2019 that we were going to take a look at the potential for accelerating Campbell 1, 2, which is currently scheduled to retire in 2031. And so we're doing that as part of this evaluation. And I would just put it this way, we're in the final throes of completing exhibits and testimony. We'll be sharing the outcome with our Board of Directors like we do and some of our large filings in early May here. And I don't want to get too far ahead of our Board of Directors here. So our objectives are true. That's what we're targeting and we look forward to sharing more in the Q2 reports. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you for that. And then, just on \u2013 may I ask on EnerBank? I mean, obviously, you've mentioned you're now tracking to the high end of the range, but it seemed to unusually sort of big number in the first quarter. Is there anything other than just strong origination going on there maybe Rejji? Garrick Rochow : Yes. As you know \u2013 yes, Rejji chairs it. So Rejji, why don\u2019t you go ahead? Rejji Hayes : Jonathan thanks for the question. I think you hit one of the bigger drivers, and so it's really a couple of things. You've got strong origination growth. And we really saw and we talked about this let's say in quarters two through four last year, a nice vacation bid with very good loan origination volume for swimming pools, HVAC systems, and that has carried on. So you've got strong origination growth. And you also I would say have a weak comp in Q1 of last year, just because, as you recall the pandemic really started to impact the global economy in the sort of latter part of March. And so Q1 of last year picked some of that up. We also do have a loan sale, as part of that earnings growth. Now, this is all unplanned. We had anticipated this in our 2021 plan, but that also offers the favorability relative to Q1 of 2020. And we've always talked about the fact that we don't allocate capital to the bank and so they have to fund their own growth. And so loan sales is certainly part of that strategy. So it's really a combination of strong origination growth coupled with the loan sale. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. I mean, can you maybe quantify how much that piece was and perhaps also talk about where that leaves the book in terms of size maybe relative to where it was? Rejji Hayes : They gave about $0.06 of upside from my prepared remarks relative to Q1 of 2020, roughly half of that was due to the loan sale and about the other half for the origination growth. So about $0.02 for each or $0.02 to $0.03 for each. And I'd say the book still looks quite good. For competitive reasons, we don't talk about the annual origination volumes, but they are still around 3 billion of assets all-in. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. Thank you, Garrick. And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotia. Please go ahead. Garrick Rochow : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Thanks. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just maybe if I'll start continuing on the EnerBank conversation there. I think Rejji, you just said that the strong origination growth from last year has continued. What's your latest thinking on when that might return to sort of a more normal level? In other words, the COVID trade will eventually moderate. There are only so many swimming pools to be installed. Rejji Hayes : Yes. So it's a good question, and we may not see the feverish volumes we saw in 2020, but we continue to see high applications and again, very good origination volume going into the second quarter. So I'm not convinced that that trend will abate any time soon. And it's not just swimming pool, they also do HVAC installation. That's a fairly non-cyclical product. And they also do resi solar and there is still good organic growth there as well. So there is decent diversification, Andrew, in the loan portfolio. Swimming pools certainly are quite strong. But again, we haven't seen any signs that, that will abate anytime soon. And if that does happen, let's say, in 2022 or beyond, we'll then at that point again, there is good HVAC volume, there is good resi solar, and they also do kitchen and windows and doors. So home improvement from our perspective is not going to be the sort of thing that's going to die out anytime soon. And we've been at this now for over a decade, and they\u2019ve delivered in a very non-cyclical way for some time now. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. And you mentioned it's trending to the high end for the full year. I mean, that kind of sounds like an understatement given that they earned $0.11 in the quarter alone. So what might be the limiting factor there as far as the \u2013 let me put it this way, is the balance sheet of CMS a limiting factor? Or are there other ways that you might slow down the growth rate to elongate the trajectory? Garrick Rochow : Yes. So let me be clear. So even though they delivered $0.11 of EPS contribution for the quarter and that was a strong beat versus Q1 of 2020 that was on plan. They were about a penny ahead of plan. So we assumed about $0.10 in a pretty front end loaded earnings trajectory in 2021. And so we do still see them kind of being within the range of $0.20 to $0.22. I wouldn't say it's due to actively potentially slowing them down. It's just part of the plan. There is a little bit of seasonality of the business. We'll see how it trends over time. But like the rest of the business, we'll manage it, where we try to avoid should rise, and if there are opportunities to derisk 2022 and beyond by some levers we pull at the bank as well as the other business, we\u2019ll look to do that. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. And then just more broadly, when you think about the CE Way, obviously, you had a really strong year last year with cost savings, strong start to the quarter this year. Are you already in a reinvestment mode to benefit customers and position yourselves well for next year and beyond? Or is it just too early given your typical uncertainty around summer weather? Garrick Rochow : I'll tell you the CE Way is alive and well, and we continue to work that system. As I shared in my comments, I do truly love that system and what it means for not only cost management, but what it means for improved customer service and co-worker engagement and employment \u2013 not employment, empowerment. So we work it all the time because it really provides some nice value for our customers in addition to cost management. So that's well under way. But to get to the heart of your question, we're early in the first part of the year here. We feel good about the quarter and we'll continue, as you know, Andrew, when there\u2019s opportunities. Should they show themselves, we'll reinvest for the benefit of our customers and for our shareholders here to really derisk the future years. Andrew Weisel : All right. Sounds good. Looking forward to the IRP. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Garrick Rochow : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Hi, thanks. I was wondering if you could comment a bit more on how energy transition could impact the upcoming IRP especially with the focus on hydrogen and expanded tax credits, such as 45Qs enhancing CCS economics. But what type of timeframe do you think this could make sense for CMS? Could it find its way into you plans or do you think they can find the way into your plans? Garrick Rochow : Well, we\u2019ve been talking about it in a bigger way than just energy transition. We call it the energy transformation. And certainly, what we're leading here. And it shows up on our first and our current and I would say, a progressive Integrated Resource Plan, the one that we're building out right now, just a ton of solar 1,100 megawatts of solar, the retirement of Karn 1 and 2 and energy efficiency and demand response programs that are outstanding offerings for our customers. But with any Integrated Resource Plan, particularly when you get to the end years of that plan there is about a 10% to 20% gap that you got to close. And that's not unique to CMS, you'll hear our peers talk about that as well. But I'll remind you, we're one of the most aggressive plans out there in decarbonization by 2040. So there does need to be technology advancements that comes in carbon capture, that comes in hydrogen, that comes in terms of lithium-ion both from a reliability, as well as affordability perspective. And so all of the above is needed. And so, in fact, we're \u2013 just even tomorrow, I'm going to be with \u2013 on a call with the Department of Energy and Office of Management and Budget tomorrow to again, we're advocating for R&D type funding to continue to close that gap particularly in the out years. And so we'll participate, as it makes sense within the regulated utility to close some of those gaps. But again, they are out in the 2035, 2040 timeframe. And then, Rejji, you might have something more to add on that as well. Rejji Hayes : Jeremy, the only part I would add to Garrick's comments is just around the tax incentives. I mean it's obviously early days, but we've been encouraged with some of the proposals we've seen offered particularly in the widened bill with tax potential incentives applied on a technical basis for zero carbon emitting resources as well as potential flexibility on choosing PTCs versus ITCs and then more refundability, which is really one of the biggest constraints for utilities to execute on some of these renewable projects. And so if we see good advancements there that obviously allows us to do more front of the media solutions in a cost effective basis for customers. So that's encouraging, but obviously early days there. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. And then just wondering if you could kind of frame your thoughts for us when it comes to the proven versus maybe the less proven technologies, targets as far as how much could be directly owned by CMS versus PPAs, just kind of any framework you could share with us there? Garrick Rochow : Well, let me offer this from a proven perspective. One of the things that we're considering within this next IRP is reliability. And so we look at loss of load expectations. And again, particularly in the backdrop of the unfortunate events in Texas, we're going to make sure that our system is reliable in every weather condition. We've got a history of that, and we'll continue to do that. And so clearly we're going to go with items that are proven that doesn't mean, we're not looking out forward and looking at R&D. But when it comes to putting equipment on the grid, we want to ensure reliability. But Rejji, I don\u2019t know, you may want to add more to that \u2013 to the question there, but I'll just give you a little bit of context. Rejji Hayes : I'd be happy to. So as Garrick mentioned, Jeremy, in his prepared remarks, we did recently get approval from the commission on our first tranche of new solar attributable to the Integrated Resource Plan, the current Integrated Resource Plan. And we were, I'd say pleased with the average cost we saw over the life of the projects when we looked at the owned opportunity versus the contracted. And so on a levelized cost of energy basis, we saw kind of high $50 per megawatt hour for the own solution and kind of low $50 per megawatt hour for the contracted solution. And so then that excludes kind of residual value and other sort of operational benefits and savings that the owned portion could offer over time. And so we do think that longer term, there could be good opportunities, as we think through the new solar build out to potentially own more. But again, it's early days in the context of the IRP, I mean, we're thinking about six gigawatts over the next several couple of decades. So more to come on that. But the first tranche look pretty encouraging. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. So is it fair to say there could be CapEx upside in IRP here based on what you're talking about there? Garrick Rochow : Jeremy, we got $25 billion in the 10 years and $3 billion to $4 billion of opportunity out there and a long, long, long track record of organic needed customer investments in the state, renewables, electric and gas to decarbonize. And so again, you know our history here, there's just lots of opportunities here at CMS Energy. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Just one last one, if I could, with COVID and reopening. Just wondering if you could comment a bit on load trends in service territory and degree of residential stickiness that you have seen and could expect to see over the balance of the year? Garrick Rochow : I'm going to turn it over to Rejji first, and then, I'll come back to some larger COVID and state-type topics. So Rejji why don't you start? Rejji Hayes : Sure. Jeremy, a pretty good trend over the course of the first quarter and I'm sure, you saw in some of the materials we rolled out this morning. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, residential up 2% versus Q1 of 2020. And so there still continues to be a little bit of stickiness in residential, which is higher margin, as we've talked about in the past. Commercial down 4%, still not quite at the pre-pandemic levels. But I think that has a bit to do with the resurgence that we've seen in terms of case counts in Michigan. And we do expect over the course of the year both commercial and industrial, which was down about 2% will be at pre-pandemic levels around mid-year. We're also encouraged with what we've seen for most of April in our smart meter data, particularly for the residential segment, which is up 4% ahead of plan. And so again, the trends look quite good. And we're also seeing just good economic trends in general. And I'll defer to Garrick on some of these details, but I still account to the fact that we've seen the residential class up about 1% versus the same period in 2020, we've seen commercial down \u2013 excuse me, a little less than 0.5%. So seeing good count volumes. And I'll have Garrick talk about the interconnection volumes we've seen, but it's been robust to say the least. So Garrick, I'll give it back to you. Garrick Rochow : Yes. Broadly from a Michigan perspective and I was with the Governor this week and as we've seen the COVID and its B117 variant. The number of hospitalizations decline, the number of positive cases declined, vaccinations continuing to increase, so I'd be surprised if there was an announcement here in the next couple of days that opens up more of Michigan, as we move forward, which will help from a commercial perspective. But just look at unemployment we're better than the U.S. right now across Michigan. And if you go into the heart of our electric service territory, Grand Rapids is even better. And we're seeing it too, and not just in unemployment numbers, but new service connects. The number of requested \u2013 well first of all, 2020 was a record year for new service connects in the midst of a pandemic. And the first, Q1 is up 27% over last year over the same time period. That's not just an initiation. That's actually initiation and constructed. So initiated and built, up 27%. And so again, we see a number of positive indicators. I could go on and on about this. Life sciences were up. Food processing is up. There is a great opportunity of growth we're seeing. And I believe it's going to continue to pick up, as we open up more and more of the state. Jeremy Tonet : That's super helpful. That's it from me. Thanks. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Michael. Michael Weinstein : Hey, good morning, guys. Hey \u2013 in terms of a potential for a higher corporate tax rate, could you talk about the potential impact that would have on you and your \u2013 and the NOLs that you have through 2024 I think on Slide 25. And then also on the same line, if you have a higher tax rate, does that incur and let's say tax credit extension for renewables, does that \u2013 does one offset the other? Does this encourage you and regulators to build \u2013 to accelerate the build out of renewables in order to keep taxes down? Garrick Rochow : Let me offer a few comments on this, and then, I'll turn it over to Rejji as well. And so, you're getting really to the affordability and the headroom question, and as Rejji mentioned earlier with the widened proposal, there's a few others out there we're following closely and we're advocating frankly with EEI in Washington. This could be a real tailwind here. I mean, we already have a very aggressive solar build out in our current IRP and these renewable credits and Rejji went through some of the benefits and specifics of the widened proposal, but they can provide a nice tailwind, a nice savings opportunity for our customers. And so I get excited about that. And many of the glass is half full for me, but I think there's some real opportunities there. And to the degree, I'll just keep this in mind, to the degree there are any headwinds or tax implications for our customers remember this, if there is one company that I'm going to bet on, it's going to be CMS Energy. I mean we\u2019ve this proven track record of delivering year-after-year from a cost management perspective, and so through the CE Way and the like. And then, as Rejji indicated, these event-driven cost reductions, MCV, Palisades, coal plant retirements, I remain optimistic on our ability to manage it. It's still early. There are still proposals on the table. And I'm confident in our ability to manage it on behalf of our customers and keep bills affordable. But Rejji, you may have more to add. Rejji Hayes : Yes. Michael, what I would just add to all of Garrick's good comment as I too am encouraged, as I mentioned before on what we're seeing in incentives. Now to get directly to your question on NOLs, so like we saw when tax reform is enacted in 2017, there was a remeasurement of NOLs and that led to a non-cash loss, and a pretty significant one. Just with the tax rate going from 35% down to 21%. So if you see it come back, let's say, to 28% you have a favorable remeasurement. Clearly, we would carve that out like we did, but that could be beneficial because it creates a greater tax shield. We'd also see some benefit at our parent and other segment, which as you likely know is primarily interest expense and so you see just a greater value in that tax shield as well. Now, to your question about whether there is a push for more renewable build given incentives to offset the rate increases, we'll hold off on our speculation around that 3-dimensional chess, but certainly, in one of the comments we offered earlier, we do think there will be certainly potential attractive incentives and that should offset some of the rate increase implication if the deferral tax rate increase above 21%. Michael Weinstein : All right. Okay. You can see what I'm getting at. I mean, the higher \u2013 the Federal Government is giving away tax credits, at the same time they are raising taxes, it would seem that state regulators would want you to build more, just standard reason I guess. Anyway, that's all I have. Thanks. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the time and the opportunity. So if I can keep ripping off perhaps a couple of the other questions here, in brief, now we\u2019re getting late. With respect to be widened plan or what have you in terms of infrastructure. How do you think; one, about the different scenarios that you come out with on the IRP and two, probably more critically, is there any risk of delay in timeline based on the timeline of credits. I was just curious as to how you're thinking about the different scenarios and impacts here given \u2013 well, I'll leave it open then for you guys. Garrick Rochow : There's a lot of proposal \u2013 tax proposal on the table and we don't see them getting \u2013 being settled here in the next several months. We're on track to file our IRP in June and it will meet those objectives or really aimed at those objectives that are laid out there in the presentation and so it will be a plan that\u2019s good for Michigan and good for our planet and matches our triple-bottom line. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right, fair enough, but it doesn't seem as that you're going to necessarily tailor any of the specific bulls around any of the proposed infrastructure efforts that could shift the planning through the IRP cycle or a process, right? Garrick Rochow : It's just too early. We're going to \u2013 I mean, we've done all the modeling, we're finalizing the details. We've got a good plan, we'll take it to the Board of Directors as we normally do but these proposals are going to move \u2013 probably going to move a lot this summer as well and so there are a bit unpredictable. I mean there's a lot of positives we see, but they are a bit unpredictable on where they land and Rejji you may have some other thoughts too. Rejji Hayes : Julien, the only thing I would add to Garrick's good comment is that it's important to remember that the legislation and how it's structured in the nature of the IRP process is pretty multifaceted and takes into account the dynamism of the world and so we look at the business usual \u2013 business as usual case, we look at a descent and the emerging technologies, we will look at environmental policy changes and then we have various variables that low price, low growth, gas prices, et cetera. And so, there are hundreds of permutations as we structure the IRP and we do take into account a number of different scenarios and we do try to choose what's best from a triple-bottom line perspective, when you put it all through that regime at it. And so I'd say there is a lot of dynamism what's taking place now, I do think it's to some extent accounted for. But we know that we'll file another one in a few years if the world changes. And so that's the other benefit of this process is that it's very iterative as well. Garrick Rochow : If you just boil this down, Julien, I think to the degree there is a renewable tax and again, we like the technology neutral, what it does is it makes it cheaper, right. And so that is the tailwind. That's the opportunity and so will file a great IRP. I know this and it's just going to make it cheaper and less expensive for our customers, which is a good thing. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Best of luck. Will speak to you after. All right. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Julien. Operator : And our next question today comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Travis. Travis Miller : Good morning everyone. Thank you. I was wondering, we've seen a couple of states here just recently suggest potentially securitization options for coal plant retirements and accelerating that, what's your thought around that and we had discussion with Michigan politicians, regulators around that? Just want your thoughts? Garrick Rochow : I mean we have worked securitization here for a long time in Michigan. In fact, as part of the law here in Michigan and requires a 90-day. It is a 90-day process. We just completed one in December for Karn 1 and 2, many states many jurisdictions do not have this. We've got a good process under way that exists. Now, it does just in full transparency, there is one of the challenges with coal plants out there as they have a remaining book value, and so if you continue to securitize those that can have an impact on credit metrics and so, as I shared in our IRP objective that's one of the things that we are watching and needs \u2013 and we need to be thoughtful about as we pursue decarbonization in our clean energy goals. Travis Miller : Fair enough, I appreciate that. That's all I had, you answered my other questions. I appreciate the time. Garrick Rochow : Yes. Thank you, Travis. Operator : Our next question today comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Hey. Good morning, Garrick. Good morning, Rejji. Garrick Rochow : Good morning. Anthony Crowdell : I have a quick question. Mostly been answered and it's follow-up of an earlier question on decarbonization and you kind of touched briefly on maybe the events in Texas. But have you noticed any pause in the policyholders or any of the parties that you're involved with during an IRP process of may be slowing down a decarbonization due to reliability. I know you touched on reliability earlier. But have you noticed any change following the Texas storms and maybe there is more of interest in keeping fossil generation around a little longer? Garrick Rochow : As I shared earlier our Integrated Resource Plan. I'm getting way into the engineering leads with you here as a loss of load expectation. And so that's one of the criteria that we're going to make sure that we deliver on. And so that reliability can come in a variety of different ways. And so \u2013 but we saw for reliability and so, again we want to make sure, what we present to the commission, to the staff up there, to all our intervenors that it has to \u2013 and when I talk about with our co-workers, when I talk about in the community and when I talk about in lancing and has to be affordable and has to be reliable and has to be clean and so we have to do all three, that's the challenge. And so again, we've got a great plan and you'll hear more about in Q2. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Garrick Rochow : Yes. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Stephen. Laura Sanchez : Hi, good morning. This is Laura calling for Stephen. On the energy transformation front and I'm sorry if this is repetitive, but I think the question is a little bit different, beyond potentially accelerating the retirement of the council units, how much more can you do without compromising the reliability of the grid, I'm wondering if there are gas plants that you can retire early without compromising the reliability of the grid and without assuming new technologies pick up? Basically how much is affordability versus reliability? Garrick Rochow : Hi, Laura. How are you? Good to have you on the call. Laura Sanchez : Thank you. Garrick Rochow : That's what that loss of load expectations study looks at. Again, we're going to model out energy and energy supply for 20 years, we're going to make sure we look at what the reliability looks like across the system to make sure the most affordable plan for our customers to make sure it's clean and then from an investor standpoint, we're going to make sure that; one, there is a nice opportunity for growth, own growth within the state of the needed customer investments as well as going to make sure a healthy balance sheet. So that's the entire balance, and so that's what the model solves for, so the question you're asking is what is exactly what the model is solving for what is that right balance point where everything comes together, and so we'll share more of what that looks like and all that mix here in Q2. Laura Sanchez : Understood. And lastly, if I may, could you comment a little bit on your current efforts on RNG? And if there are any voluntary programs altered or that will be offered in your gas utility? Garrick Rochow : So there is a small amount of RNG on our system, as we speak. To obtain net zero methane by 2030 we will have to put a bit more RNG on our system. I say a bit, let me quantify that. We move about 300 billion cubic feet of natural gas on our system on an annual basis. We\u2019ll have to put by about 0.3, yes, I said 0.3 billion cubic feet so that will help us get to net zero along with some thoughtful and deliberate investments in replacing old mains and services. So there\u2019ll be more added as we move forward. Now as we again, continue to think about our carbon footprint, there is the potential to add more renewable natural gas across our system. We'll do that in a thoughtful and deliberate way that's affordable for our customers and is considered out the planet. Now to your specific question on a program; we do not have a specific renewable natural gas program for our customers. We intend to add one over the course of this year. And so we'll be making a filing in 2021 that offers a program for our customers in this space. Laura Sanchez : Sounds good. Thank you so much. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Garrick Rochow for any final remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Rocco. And I like to thank you all, again for joining us today. I'm looking forward to when we can meet face-to-face hopefully soon and we can do that safely before the year is over. Take care and be safe. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone and welcome to the CMS Energy Second Quarter 2021 Results. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at 12 p.m. Eastern Time, running through August 5. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Srikanth Maddipati : Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. It\u2019s great to be with you, and we thank you for your continued interest and support. I\u2019m going to start today with the end in mind, strong quarter and a great first half of the year, giving us confidence as we target the high end of the guidance range. Rejji will walk through the details of the quarter, and I\u2019ll share what the strong results mean for 2021 earnings. Needless to say, I\u2019m very pleased. An important gene sale of EnerBank at 3 times book value, moving from noncore to the core business with a strong focus on regulated utility growth. The sale of the bank provides for greater financial flexibility, eliminating planned equity issuance from 2022 to 2024. And in the end, Reggie will share how we have reduced our equity issuance need for 2021 in today\u2019s remarks. Furthermore, with the filing of our integrated resource plan, you can see the path for more than $1 billion into the utility, again, without equity issuance. Not only is there visibility to that investment, that\u2019s certainly in the time line for review. I\u2019m excited about this IRP. It\u2019s a remarkable plan. Many have set net zero goals. We have industry-leading net zero goals and this IRP provides a path and is an important proof point in our commitment. We are leading the clean energy transformation. It starts with our investment thesis. This simple but intentional approach has stood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward. It is grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders and enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. With the sale of EnerBank and the plan to exit coal by 2025, our investment thesis gets even simpler. But now it\u2019s also cleaner and leaner. We continue to mature and strengthen our lean operating system, the CE Way, which delivers value by reducing cost and improving quality, ensuring affordability for our customers, and our thesis is further strengthened by Michigan\u2019s supportive regulatory construct. All of this supports our long-term adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%, and combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. All of this remains solidly grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. As I mentioned, our integrated resource plan provides the proof points to our investment thesis, our net zero commitments and highlights our commitment to the triple bottom line by accelerating our decarbonization efforts, making us one of the first utility in the nation to exit coal or increasing our renewable build-out, adding about eight gigawatts of solar by 2040, two gigawatts from the previous plan. Furthermore, this plan ensures reliability, a critical attribute as we place more intermittent resources on the grid. The purchase of over two gigawatts of existing natural gas generation allows us to exit coal and dramatically reduces our carbon footprint. Existing natural gas generation is key. And like we\u2019ve done historically with the purchases of our Zeeland and Jackson generating stations. This is a sweet spot for us where we reduce permitting, construction and start-up risk. It is also thoughtful and that is not a 40- to 50-year commitment that you would get with a new asset, which we believe is important, as we transition to net zero carbon. And, yes, on other hand, our plan is affordable for our customers. It will generate $650 million of savings, essentially paying for our transition to clean energy. This is truly a remarkable plan. It is carefully considered and data-driven. We\u2019ve analyzed hundreds of scenarios with different sensitivities and our plan was thoughtfully developed with extensive stakeholder engagement. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of this plan and especially the team that put it together. We\u2019ve done our homework, and I\u2019m confident it is the best plan for our customers, our coworkers, for great state of Michigan, of course, you, our investors to hit the triple bottom line. The Integrated Resource Plan is a key element of Michigan\u2019s strong regulatory construct, which is known across the industry as one of the best. It is a result of legislation designed to ensure a primary recovery of the necessary investments to advance safe and reliable energy in our state. Michigan\u2019s forward-looking test years and the three-year pre-approval structure of the IRP process is visibility on our future growth. It enables us and the commission to align on long-term generation planning and provide greater certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation. We anticipate an initial order for the IRP from the commission in April and a final order in June of next year. The visibility provided by Michigan\u2019s regulatory construct enables us to grow our capital plan to make the needed investments on our system. On Slide six, you can see that our five-year capital plan has grown every year. Our current five-year plan, which we\u2019ll update on our year-end call includes $13.2 billion of needed customer investment. It does not contain the upside in our IRP. The IRP provides a clear line of sight to the timing and composition of an incremental $1.3 billion of opportunity. And as I shared on the previous slide, the regulatory construct provides timely approval of future capital expenditures. I really like this path forward. And beyond our IRP, there is plenty of opportunity for our five-year capital plan to grow given the customer investment opportunities we have in our 10-year plan. Our backlog of needing investments is as vast as our system, which serves nearly seven million people in all 68 counties of Michigan\u2019s Lower Peninsula. We see industry-leading growth continuing well into the future. So where does that put us today? As I stated in my opening remarks, we had a strong quarter and a great first half of the year. The bank sale and now the IRP filing provide important context for our future growth and positioning of the business. Let me share my confidence. For 2021, we are focused on delivering adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.61 to $2.65 per share, and we expect to deliver toward the high end of that range. For 2022, we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.87 per share. Given the strong performance we are seeing this year, the reduced financing needs next year and continued investments in the utility, there is upward momentum as we move forward. Now many of you have asked about the dividend. We are reaffirming again no change to the $1.74 dividend for 2021. As we move forward, we are committed to growing the dividend in line with earnings with a target payout ratio of about 60%. While we are not going to provide 2022 dividend guidance on this call, I want to be very clear, we are committed to growing the dividend in 2022. It\u2019s what you expect, it\u2019s what you own it, and it is big part of our value. I will offer this. Our target payout ratio does not need to be achieved immediately, it will happen naturally, as we grow our earning. Finally, I want to touch on long-term growth rate, which is 6% to 8%. This has not changed. It\u2019s driven by the capital investment needs of our system, our customers\u2019 affordability and the need for a healthy balance sheet to fund those investments. Historically, we\u2019ve grown at 7%. But as we redeploy the proceeds from the bank, we will deliver toward the high end through 2025. I\u2019ll also remind you that we tend to rebase higher off of actuals. We have historically either met or exceeded our guidance. All in, a strong quarter, positioned well for 2021 with upward momentum and with EnerBank and the IRP, it all comes together nicely positioned for the long term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rejji to discuss the details of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings. Rejji? Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. Before I walk through the details of our financial results for the quarter, you\u2019ll note that throughout our materials, we have reported the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations, thereby removing it as a reportable segment and adjusting our quarterly and year-to-date results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. And while we\u2019re on EnerBank, I\u2019ll share that the sale process continues to progress nicely, as the merger application was filed in June with the various federal and state regulators will be evaluating the transaction for approval, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year. Moving on to continuing operations. For the second quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $158 million or $0.55 per share, which excludes $0.07 from EnerBank. For comparative purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.09 above our second quarter 2020 results, exclusive of EnerBank\u2019s EPS contribution last year. The key drivers of our financial performance for the quarter were rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, recovering commercial and industrial sales and the usual strong tax planning. Year-to-date, we delivered adjusted net income from continuing operations of $472 million or $1.64 per share, which excludes $0.19 per share from EnerBank and is up $0.37 per share versus the first half of 2020, assuming a comparable adjustment for discontinued operations. All in, we\u2019re tracking well ahead of plan on all of our key financial metrics to date, which offers great financial flexibility for the second half of the year. The waterfall chart on Slide nine provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020. As a reminder, this walk excludes the financial performance of EnerBank. For the first half of 2021, rate relief has been the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.36 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for electric and gas businesses. As a reminder, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs, such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs at the utility. The rate relief related upside in 2021 has been partially offset by the planned increases in our operating and maintenance expenses to fund key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonization. As a reminder, these expenses align with our recent rate orders and equate to $0.06 per share of negative variance versus 2020. It is also worth noting that this calculation also includes cost savings realized to date, largely due to our waste elimination efforts through the CE Way, which are ahead of plan. We also benefited in the first half of 2021 from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $0.06 per share and recovering commercial and industrial sales, which coupled with solid tax planning provided $0.01 per share of positive variance in aggregate. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we feel quite good about the glide path to delivering toward the high end of our EPS guidance range, as Garrick noted. As always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case, translates to $0.02 per share of negative variance, given the absence of the favorable weather experienced in the second half of 2020. We\u2019ll continue to benefit from the residual impact of rate relief, which equates to $0.12 per share of pickup. And I\u2019ll remind you, is not subject to any further MPSC actions. We also continue to execute on our operational and customer-related projects, which we estimate will have a financial impact of $0.21 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020 given anticipated reinvestments in the second half of the year. We have also seen the usual conservatism in our utility non-weather sales assumptions and our nonutility segment performance, which as a reminder, now excludes EnerBank. All in, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the latter part of 2021. Turning to our financing plan for the year. I\u2019m pleased to highlight our recent successful issuance of $230 million of preferred stock at an annual rate of 4.2%, one of the lowest rates ever achieved for a preferred offering of its kind. This transaction satisfies the vast majority of funding needs of CMS Energy, our parent company for the year and given the high level of equity content ascribed to the security by the rating agencies, we have reduced our planned equity issuance needs for the year to up to $100 million from up to $250 million. As a reminder, over half of the $100 million of revised equity issuance needs for the year are already contracted via equity forwards. It is also worth noting that given the terms and conditions of the EnerBank merger agreement in the event EnerBank continues to outperform the financial plan prior to the closing of the transaction, we would have a favorable purchase price adjustment related to the increase in book equity value at closing, which could further reduce our financing needs for 2021 and provide additional financial flexibility in 2022. Closing out the financing plan, I\u2019ll also highlight that we recently extended our long-term credit facilities by one year to 2024, both at the parent and the utility. Lastly, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that later today, we\u2019ll file our 10-Q, which will be the last 10-Q owned by Glenn Barba, our Chief Accounting Officer, who most of you know from his days leading our IR team. Glenn announced his retirement earlier this year after serving admirably for nearly 25 years at CMS, which included him signing over 75 quarterly SEC filings during his tenure. Glenn, thank you for your wonderful service to CMS. You certainly left it better than you found it, and we wish you the very best in this next chapter in your life. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before we open it up for Q&A. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Rejji, and thank you, Glenn, for your service. As we\u2019ve highlighted today, we\u2019ve had a great first half of the year. We are pleased to have delivered such strong results. We\u2019re positioned well to continue that momentum into the second half of the year as we focus on finalizing the sale of the bank and moving through the IRP process. I\u2019m proud to lead this great team, and we can\u2019t wait to share our success as we move forward together. This is an exciting time at CMS Energy. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Garrick Rochow : Good morning Jeremy, how are you? Rejji Hayes : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : Good, thanks. Just wanted to start, you mentioned growing earnings at the high end of the 6% to 8% range, and kind of as the proceeds get redeployed here over time. Just wondering if you could dig in a little bit more. If there\u2019s any more color you can provide on how to think about the timing here? It seems like a lot of opportunity with the IRP. But how should we think about the high end? I mean basically, I\u2019m trying to think what type of glide path could we see where the earnings trajectory could overlap, I guess, pre EnerBank guide at that point? Garrick Rochow : Jerry, I think you said some key words, opportunity in one word I\u2019d add -- or two words, I guess, I would add to that is, upward momentum. And so off of 2022, 6% to 8%, we\u2019re going to lever toward the high end of that through 2025. And then when I think about the IRP, there\u2019s obviously two big tranches, let\u2019s say, Covert in 2023 and the acquisition of that facility and also the enterprise facilities on 2025. Those are incremental to the plan, to the capital plan. And those strengthen and lengthen that growth through that time period. And so again, I feel confident in our ability to deliver on that. And I think this is a great plan with upward momentum as we look at that time period from 2022 to 2025. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks to that. And then I know we\u2019re early in the IRP process here. But just wondering if you could expand a bit more, I guess, on early stakeholder feedback in just your thoughts at this point. Garrick Rochow : Jeremy, I wish you could see my face, I\u2019ve got a big grin on my face. I\u2019m smiling. I love to have a case where there\u2019s no push back and there\u2019s no innovators that happened with every case, as you well know. But here\u2019s where I see the IRP there is a win in here and this is why it\u2019s remarkably there\u2019s a win for everyone that saw the intervenors or stakeholders. When I think about the environmental community 60% reduction in Co2, well above and beyond the requirements of the Paris Accord the 2 degree and the 1.5 degrees scenario, well above and beyond what Biden proposed for 2030. So a big win for the environmental community in there. A big one for our customers affordability, $650 million of savings. That\u2019s a great opportunity. Reliability or maybe better state and resiliency of the electric grid. This is a more reliable plan that our previous IRP. We have done more homework to ensure that we don\u2019t have a Texas like situation as we look forward to the future with intermittent resource. I feel really great about that. And then for our investors over a billion dollars of incremental investment. The ability to treat these assets, and other securitization is voluntary. The ability to treat these assets, the existing assets than the book value as a regulatory asset process. I feel really good. There\u2019s a winning here for everyone. And then there\u2019s a win for everyone the opportunity to reach settlement and even if it\u2019s not fair enough to go the whole distance I feel really good about that. And just one last reminder on this 2018 IRP number of intervenors engaged with that. We settled that case, 21 IRP number of intervenors in that case, and with that pattern of wins that I just walked through, there\u2019s a great way that we can reach a great outcome of our IRP, feel good about it Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Got you. That\u2019s really helpful. Sounds promising just a small one if I could just want to reconcile I think the equity 100 million for the balance of the year, I think was in the slide in a good chunk that already locked in. But were there any comments as possible, even less than that? Just want to make sure I had that straight as far as what the equity thoughts were for the balance of the year? Garrick Rochow : Yes. I am going to move to Rejji about that one. Rejji Hayes :  Yes. Good morning Jeremy. Good question. So where we sit today, we\u2019re comfortable saying up to 100 because of the preferred stock issuance. And remember, we\u2019ve got a little north of 50 million of that already locked in through fours. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities over the course of this year. And if we can reduce that, we may do that. But for now, we\u2019re comfortable saying up to 100 million. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll stop there. Thanks. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Insoo Kim : Thank you. Just first question is following up on Jeremy\u2019s question on the earnings growth trajectories, I just want to clarify from my end that you\u2019re saying often to 2022 a guidance range your growth is going to be toward the upper end of 6 to 8 percent range through 2025 and that irregardless of whether the hierarchy [indiscernible]. Garrick Rochow : Thanks for your question. It\u2019s great to hear from you. That\u2019s exactly what we stated six to eight. We expect to deliver toward the high end and the IRP cohort and those enterprises assets strengthen and lengthen that path. So absolutely. Insoo Kim : Okay. Got it. Got it. And then just -- so picking the IRP side, you\u2019ve been so consistent in achieving that 10% range like clockwork for a long time. I guess, going to that upper end, again, excluding the IRP, what kind of gives you confidence that maybe that could -- what the longer-term run rate could be of that type of growth rate? Garrick Rochow : Well, I\u2019d actually started with this year in 2021. This momentum that we have right now carries into 2022. Hopefully, you heard that in our comments from the $2.85 to $2.87, and we\u2019ll continue to revisit that on the quarterly calls. But again, that carries into this plan. And remember what we do, we rebase off that source. So we deliver, we either meet or exceed guidance. And then that\u2019s the point where we rebase off of. And so it\u2019s that compounding effect that you\u2019ve seen time and time again. And so that\u2019s an important piece of it. But also we think about the entire triple bottom line. And so I think a great example of this IRP, we\u2019re going to put $1.3 billion in, and it saves our customers $650 million. That\u2019s at CE Way mindset coming play, making these investments, attacking the cost stack, share of wallets 3%. It was 4% went to 3% share wallet. So we balance all those things, the affordability, the balance sheet and make this come together. So again, I feel really confident about our glide path forward. And Rejji, might have some comments on that as well. Rejji Hayes : Insoo, the only thing I would add to Garrick\u2019s good comments is, as you think longer term, we noted in the IRP that we intend to do about eight gigawatts of solar new build, and that\u2019s about two gigawatts higher than the prior plan. And so that creates additional capital investment opportunities. We\u2019re assuming it\u2019s a similar construct where it\u2019s about 50% owned and 50% contracted. However, if we continue to be more and more cost competitive, that could create additional upside to own more of that opportunity over time. You couple that with the fact that we\u2019ve talked about the $3 billion to $4 billion of upside opportunities in our 10-year capital plan, a portion of which we think will be in our next five-year plan, but there\u2019ll still be balance after that. And so as we continue to take costs, whether it\u2019s through the CE Way or some of these episodic opportunities like PPAs, repricing and so on, well, that creates more headroom to bring in that additional capital. So we feel very good about the long-term glide path for capital growth, which drives rate base growth and then earnings. Insoo Kim : Understood. That\u2019s definitely helpful. Just one more, if I could. Going back to that IRP plan, I think a lot of the questions that people have is whether this plan, which basically swaps out coal for at least in the interim, gassing the portfolio, and how that will be received by the various stakeholders. I appreciate your comments on working with the various stakeholders as well as the commission on this type of plan. But how confident are you in this time being the best one? And if there are some, I guess, room for negotiation, if this doesn\u2019t end up being the best plan for the commission, what are some of the alternatives that could potentially also work? Garrick Rochow : Well, this is the best plan for Michigan. One of the things that our first IRP taught us is that -- we learned a lot from that. And this is, I would just say, a great plan, remarkable plan for all the reasons I mentioned a few minutes ago. And so there\u2019s a win in here for everyone. And when there\u2019s a win, there\u2019s an opportunity to reach settlement or go the whole distance. And so again, I would just reference 2018. We were very successful with a number of interveners and being able to get to a settlement. But that\u2019s what\u2019s great about this regulatory construct. We\u2019re working with these interveners in the process. And if there\u2019s an opportunity to settle where there\u2019s an outcome that is good for all, we will do that. And so we\u2019re early on into -- and again, I\u2019m very optimistic we have a great plan. And I don\u2019t know Rejji, do you want to add to that? Rejji Hayes : Insoo, the only thing I would add to that is that trust that we evaluated the number of different permutations that as instructed for the IRP construct. And so we certainly looked at whether we could transition to renewable power more rapidly or fully in as a substitute for the retirements and the economics just don\u2019t get you there, plus you also introduce significant reliability and resilience trends given the lack of really long-term storage solutions. And so we certainly evaluated it. But as Garrick noted, we deem this plan where it sits today as the best plan for Michigan. And also with the gas facilities and obviously foregoing the O&M and capital we know we would have on our coal facilities, you take that into account with the fuel arbitrage you get from gas versus coal and just less purchases you now have controllable dispatch. It just brings substantial cost savings to customers, which would not be offered if we went to a full renewable solution in lieu of gas as a bridge fuel. So we feel like this is the most economic opportunity for all stakeholders. Garrick Rochow : Yes, I\u2019m going to add to that. I just want to be just crystal clear on this, not only affordability piece, but those natural gas plants are required for resiliency in the state. You can\u2019t get here from there. That\u2019s just bottom line. And so it\u2019s that crystal clear. And that\u2019s why I have just a high degree of confidence. Insoo Kim : Thanks for the color. Thank you so much. Operator : And our question today comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Garrick Rochow : Hey Anthony. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning Garrick. Thank you so much. Just one quick question on the dividend. You\u2019ve laid out a nice plan for earnings growth rate, and you\u2019re pretty confident in that 2025 high end. But you -- what\u2019s your concern over providing that type of detail on the dividend growth rate? Garrick Rochow : Well, you said pretty confident. I would change that word to really confident. And so there\u2019s a little bit [indiscernible] your question. But I\u2019m equally confident in our dividend piece. And what you heard from me is that confidence in dividend growth for 2022, we recognize the importance of it, and we have it built into our financial plan. I really want to hand it over to Rejji here because there is an important piece that\u2019s associated with the sale of the bank and closure in Q4 that also shapes that dividend. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re -- most pieces have to come together so that we can share that potential here at the end of the year. But go ahead, Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Yes, that\u2019s right. So if you think about some of the dynamism we might see in the second half of the year, the closing and the timing of the closing of the EnerBank transaction could certainly impact what we might plan to do for 2022 dividend. But to go back to Garrick\u2019s comments, our commitment is to grow the dividend beyond the $1.74 per share, where it is today. And then longer term, again, we\u2019ll certainly have that dividend grow commensurate with earnings. But certainly, the bank sale and the timing of that will have an impact in the near term and then longer term, again, right in line with earnings growth. And so we feel highly confident that we will have a competitive dividend. And we know that it\u2019s a core part of our value proposition, as Garrick noted in his prepared remarks. Garrick Rochow : And just add to that. There\u2019s -- with the sale and that closure there, there\u2019s upside potential there from a dividend perspective, again. So we want to be able to -- our investors to be able to share some of that positive news. Anthony Crowdell : If I could just jump in with one last question related to the IRP. Is there any part of the IRP you think maybe be the most challenging or may generate the most concern with the interveners? Garrick Rochow : I don\u2019t know about most challenging. I think that\u2019s -- I\u2019ll just tell you this, Anthony. Back in 2014 and 2015, I was a policy witness. I\u2019ve been on the stand with interveners been crossed by attorneys. They go after a lot of different things in the case. And here\u2019s -- again, we\u2019ve got strong testimony. We got great precedent. We\u2019re used to this stuff. We do this all the time with our rate cases. We\u2019ve done it with a previous IRP. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything this team can\u2019t handle, frankly. And so -- and we\u2019re prepared to do that. As Rejji alluded to a minute ago, there\u2019s a lot of detail, a lot of modeling and data that went into this. And so it\u2019s a very strong case. Anthony Crowdell : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Hey good morning team. Thanks for taking my question. Garrick Rochow : Good morning. Durgesh Chopra : Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just on the IRP. I noticed that you proposed a couple of coal plant shutdowns but then including them in the rate base post their shutdown, just kind of curious as to sort of if the state has done that previously, or are there some precedent there that you feel comfortable with that proposal? Garrick Rochow : Well, I do feel comfortable with it. There\u2019s a precedent set in Colorado, Florida, Wisconsin for a similar approach in Michigan. We do have a nice ability to securitize, but it is voluntary, and that\u2019s an important piece of this. And so it\u2019s essentially -- in 2025, it\u2019s about $1.2 billion of remaining book value, to going through and securitize that just doesn\u2019t make sense. This is going to be a drag in credit metrics. They have an impact on cost of capital, which ultimately shows up on the customers\u2019 bill. That\u2019s -- I mean, that doesn\u2019t make sense. And so we\u2019ve really got a good approach there. It\u2019s different than how we\u2019ve approached it previously. But again, there\u2019s a nice precedent that\u2019s been set, and I\u2019m really -- the testimony -- I\u2019ve reviewed the testimony, it\u2019s -- we\u2019re in a good spot. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. I appreciate the color there. And obviously, you can always fall back to securitization if that leads -- if that ends up being the case. But I appreciate the color there. And then just maybe to Rejji, can you clarify sort of the -- I\u2019m trying to see the equity elimination through 2024. You don\u2019t talk about 2025. So should we assume sort of the normal cadence of equity, I believe that was $250 million per year, to go back to that starting in 2025. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that to the comment that the $1 billion additional in the IRP, you don\u2019t need to finance that with equity. Just any color there, Rejji, would be helpful. Rejji Hayes : Yes. Happy to, Durgesh. First, let me just circle back to your closing comment just to be unambiguous around this. And so the notion of falling back on this securitization. As we noted when we rolled out the IRP, as we noted in our prepared remarks, this is the proposed plan. This is not a buffet. We\u2019re not thinking about any type of fallback option. And again, from a securitization perspective, to Garrick\u2019s comments, given the impact it could have on our balance sheet, we\u2019ve already done with the inclusion of Con one and two in the retirement and securitization there, we will already have $1 billion of securitized debt on our balance sheet as of 2023. So we really cannot accommodate alternatives like that. So I want to be very clear, we do not view that as a fallback option and the proposed plan is what it is. So with respect to the question around equity, yes, you\u2019re right in that as we disclosed when we announced the EnerBank sale, we are not planning to issue any equity from 2022 through 2024, even with the capital opportunities that we\u2019ve announced today with the IRP and potentially some of that upside opportunity. So no additional equity. For 2025, you can assume the up to $250 million level that we articulated when we first rolled out our five-year plan. So that\u2019s still a good working assumption for now. But obviously, there\u2019s a lot of time left. And if we can recalibrate and see the data moving away that supports reducing that, at some point, we may revisit that. But for now, assume $250 million in that out of year of 2025. Is that helpful? Unidentified Analyst : Very helpful. And thanks for clarifying that securitization comment. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Constantine here for Shar. But I think if I may -- if I can just follow up on kind of one more kind of, I guess, IRP capex-related question. What are some of the constructs that are -- that the incremental portion of capex fall under? Is it all fully covered by the IRP as proposed, plus kind of the annual rate case process that you have? Any kind of -- does any of the non-IRP work can need any incremental trackers? But does any of this incremental work can start prompting more equity needs down the line? Or is it fully kind of baked in at this point? Garrick Rochow : I think Rejji and I will tag team this one. And so let me just kind of frame up when I think about our capital plans. And I think we\u2019ll talk about our current work across our utility but also this IRP. And so at the end of the year, in our January call, we\u2019re going to add another year to that five-year capital plan, and that\u2019s going to be more capital opportunity. That five-year plan is going to grow. And it\u2019s going to be in our gas business, it\u2019s going to be in our electric distribution business. And so there\u2019s some growth opportunity there. Then we\u2019ll continue to follow this IRP through the process through that 10-month process. Again, we feel confident in the outcome of that. And then that\u2019s an incremental 1.3. And so you can imagine in Q2 of 2022, we\u2019re going to -- with a successful outcome, there will be an adjustment in 2023 to accommodate the Covert facility. And then also an adjustment in 2025. And so you can see some of that play out over the five years and into the 10-year because when you look at this integrated resource plan, it goes from \u201825 to \u201827. And so some of that still will be able to fall in the 10-year piece as well. And so there\u2019s some update that will take place along those lines. So that\u2019s kind of the capital layout. But, Rejji, certainly, tag team this with me. Rejji Hayes : Sure, happy to. So Constantine, I appreciate the question. We\u2019re pretty methodical. So I\u2019ll put the IRP aside, we\u2019re pretty methodical in how we think about the capital plan of the utility. And we really spend a lot of time providing long-term visibility on customer investment opportunities across each of the businesses. And so the current five-year plan has around $2.5 billion of what I\u2019ll call clean energy generation spend. And then the balance is electric and gas infrastructure spend. And so we noted when we filed our gas case a couple of years ago that we had about $10 billion of gas infrastructure-related investments for safety, reliability and decarbonization of about $1 billion per year of run rate. And so you can expect an extension of that capital investment opportunity and subsequent iterations of -year plans. And so we\u2019ll do more gas infrastructure. And again, we run about $1 billion per year run rate in that regard. Electric infrastructure is comparable, where we\u2019re doing a little over $1 billion per year of electric infrastructure work to improve reliability. And the IRP is also where we\u2019re seeing capital investment opportunities. So the existing IRP, remember, we\u2019re still executing on a 1.1-gigawatt tranche, and we\u2019re going to own half of that. And so all of that is going to be part of the next iteration. And so those are the sort of non-new IRP opportunities. Again, we\u2019ll see those come in, and we also talked about starting to take on some of those upside opportunities, which in our 10-year plan of $3 billion to $4 billion, we wouldn\u2019t do all of that in the next vintage, but a portion of it. And again, it\u2019s more electric and gas infrastructure, as well as clean energy generation related spend. And so those would be some of the projects that we would invest in beyond this new IRP. We\u2019re highly confident that we\u2019ll be able to create the headroom to introduce those into the capital plan. You asked about trackers. The only thing I would mention in that regard is in our gas infrastructure capital plan, we do have the equivalent or comparable structure, like a tracker and that\u2019s in our enhanced infrastructure replacement program. And so we have that on the gas side, but we don\u2019t have any other say sort of a historical type trackers like that. And so we obviously put them into the cases we filed on a serial basis and then that dictates what ends up in the final plan. Does that make sense? Unidentified Analyst : It does. I think that\u2019s very helpful. And if I may shift a little bit to more of a fundamental question. So the electric sales volumes seem to be normalizing with reopening more or less and especially with the strong kind of C&I growth and residential coming down a bit, can you kind of talk about your thoughts on the residential load and how sticky it is versus expectations? And maybe kind of the reversion of the residential load causing headwinds in terms of earnings for \u201821 or expectations in \u201822? Garrick Rochow : I\u2019m going to have Rejji start with some of the specifics and then I\u2019ll talk about some macro at the end. So Rejji, why don\u2019t you grab it? Rejji Hayes : Yes. Constantine, we\u2019ve been quite pleased with what we\u2019ve seen really across all of the customer classes to date. And so we have good detail on the 15-page guide just we distributed. Also in the appendix, you can see the year-to-date trends in the presentation today. And so we\u2019ve got residential year-to-date down a little over 1%. That compares favorably to plan. We had much more bearish expectations because we were assuming a more rapid return to facilities. And so our full year plan was something closer to down roughly 5% and we\u2019re ahead of plan. So that does imply that we\u2019re seeing a good level of stickiness to this mass teleworking trend, which I do think will be part of a post-pandemic normal. And obviously, that\u2019s higher-margin load. And so residential continues to outperform our expectations. And then we\u2019re also seeing commercial and industrial, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, come back nicely. And so year-to-date, commercial is up around 3.5%. And we had in our plan about that level and then industrials at 13% year-to-date, 2021 versus 2020. And our plan, we said on a full year basis, about 6% up. And so we\u2019re seeing surprise to the upside across all fronts. And so intra-year, that obviously creates upside and potential contingencies as we go into the second half of the year. But longer term, as you roll that into your rate cases, that creates headroom because you\u2019re introducing more kilowatt hours into the denominator of your rate calculation. So we feel very good about the road ahead to date. It\u2019s still early days; the pandemic is not behind us yet. But again, we\u2019re still seeing very encouraging trends on the load side. The other leading indicators we\u2019ve talked about in the past are just interconnection activities, new service requests; they\u2019re up over 30% year-to-date versus where they were in 2020. And 2020 may not be the best comp given the pandemic. So we also look at 2019, again, up 30% versus where we were pre-pandemic. So interconnections are strong, staking requests are strong. Customer counts are quite good with commercial up 1%. And so again, everything seems to be trending from a load perspective in the right direction. Garrick Rochow : I\u2019ll just add to that, just a little bit of clarification. So those new service connections -- interconnections, those are installs. Those aren\u2019t someone dreaming of a house or thinking about a business. Those are actually in the ground. And so again, it gives you some idea of the momentum here. We continue to have unemployment rates well below the national average here in Michigan in the heart of our service territory. Grand Rapids, it\u2019s even better. And just to give you a little flavor over the quarter, we\u2019ve even seen growth in, again, macro trends and people opening new business in Michigan. In fact, we\u2019re under an NDA right now with the company. But it\u2019s $300 million investment, 30 megawatts, 150 jobs that are locating here in our service territory in Michigan. And I could [indiscernible] two other examples of that. And so coming out of the pandemic here, and we\u2019re seeing a nice economic development growth here in Michigan as well. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s very helpful color. Thanks so much for taking the questions and congrats on the great quarter. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Good morning guys, how are you doing? Garrick Rochow : Good. We\u2019re doing great Paul. Paul Patterson : So most of my questions been answered but just back on that securitization question. Could you remind me the size of the asset that\u2019s now going to be amortized as opposed to  securitized? Garrick Rochow : Yes. The remaining book value in 2025 of the those coal plants would be $1.2 billion. That is another consideration in this filing. Paul Patterson : Okay. And you guys mentioned that the securitization you thought would be credit negative in comparison to the plan that you\u2019re putting forward. And could you -- I mean, just to sort of walk just sort of very high level, the reason for that is because you\u2019ll be amortizing the cash flow faster. Is that the way to sort of think about the -- excuse me, you\u2019ll be amortizing the assets faster and the cash flow will be stronger, is that how you\u2019re looking at this? Or is there something else I should be thinking about? Rejji Hayes : So Paul, this is Rejji. So a couple of things there. So Moody\u2019s, as you may recall, treat securitized debt as debt in their metric calculations. And so you have that levering effect of securitizations because they are effectively nonrecourse debt, but Moody\u2019s is the one rating agency that does impute it as debt. And so that $1.2 billion that Garrick noted would be dollar-for-dollar accounted as debt in our credit metric calculations. So you\u2019ve got credit dilution there. And then you couple that with the fact that you\u2019re going to forego earnings on $1.2 billion of rate base over time. And so you couple sort of the impact on the denominator where you just have dollar for dollar debt of $1.2 billion, and then you have the dilution in your numerator because you\u2019re foregoing earnings on that equity portion of that rate base over that period of time. That\u2019s what offers that levering effect. Paul Patterson : Okay. I follow you on that. Of course, you\u2019re getting the cash upfront though with the securitization. So I mean, I\u2019m just sort of -- maybe we can take that off-line, but okay, I understand that. And then in terms of the plan, I mean, it sounds like it really is a win-win-win. I\u2019m just wondering, has there been any change in the trajectory or your -- what you\u2019re expecting in terms of customer rates going forward, as a result of the IRP? Or is it too early to sort of tell? Are you guys pretty much on track as you were thinking before, and this is just going to be some incremental savings that will help you meet your goals? Do you follow what I\u2019m saying? Garrick Rochow : I do follow what you\u2019re saying. And so we look at -- across that 5-year plan of investments we look at the rate impact and two, the bill impact, which is also critically important for our residential and commercial customers. And so that is part of the five year. And as we -- again, this incremental capital of $1.3 billion, it provides $650 million of savings over our current plan. And so this is -- so again, this comes together nicely to your point, Paul, from an affordability perspective for our customers. Paul Patterson : Okay. well awesome thanks so much and congratulations. Garrick Rochow : Yes. Thank you Paul. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes the question and answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Garrick Rochow for closing remarks. Garrick Rochow : Well again I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Again strong quarter, great first half of the year and upward momentum and just again I\u2019m looking forward to seeing everyone in person here as we again faithfully as we move through the latter half of the year. Take care and be safe. Operator : Thank you sir. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CMS Energy Third Quarter 2021 Results. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call beginning today at 12 p.m. Eastern Time, running through November 4. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sri Maddipati : Thank you, Rocco. Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to share we've delivered another strong quarter and continue to be ahead of plan for the year. I'll walk through the specifics in a moment, but I couldn't be more pleased with the strong execution demonstrated by the team, both operationally and financially. We continue to deliver every day for our customers, co-workers, and for you, our investors. Earlier this month, we completed the sale of EnerBank, grossing over $1 billion in proceeds. I want to thank the entire team that brought this to close. The sale of the bank simplifies in focuses our business models squarely on energy, primarily the regulated utility and important step as we continue to lead the clean energy transformation. The proceeds from this sale with one key initiative in our utility business related to safety, reliability, resiliency, and our clean energy transformation. As shared in previous calls, we have eliminated our equity needs from 2022 through 2024. Furthermore, Rejji will highlight in his prepared remarks, how we have continued to reduce this year's equity needs as well. The key word there continued. As we double down on the clean energy transformation. I am also pleased to share that we received approval for our voluntary green pricing program, which would add an additional 1,000 megawatts of owned renewable generation for our growing renewable portfolio. This program is in high demand in currently oversubscribed. And more importantly, it's what our customers are asking for an important step in offering renewable energy solutions for our customers. As we prepare for the grid of the future, we have a highly visible in detailed capital plans outlined in our recently filed electric distribution infrastructure investment plan. This plan provides a five-year view of the projects down to the circuit level, where we plan to invest to ensure the reliability and resiliency of our electric infrastructure and align with our operational and financial plans. As always, we balance these investments with customer affordability, our prices remain competitive, as the average residential customer pays about $2 a day to heat their home and $4 a day to keep the lights on. And because we know our most vulnerable customers still struggle. Our team has mobilized resources at the state and federal levels to ensure their protection. In fact, as we approach the winter heating season, our 90 day arrears are back to pre-pandemic levels with an 80% reduction in our uncollectable accounts. Our commitment to identifying and eliminating waste means that we keep our prices affordable. This commitment is evident in our results. In the first nine months of this year, we surpassed our full year cost reduction target of more than $40 million. The CE Way is in our DNA and we continue to deliver savings in the near-term and well into the future. Speaking of the future, this year, we grew our EV program with Power My Fleet. This is part of our long-term planning and collaboration with Michigan businesses, governments, and school systems, looking to electrify their vehicle fleet. Within just a few months of the program introduction, we were working with nearly 20 different customers on their fleet and have another 50 who have indicated interest the next launch, exceeding our expectations. This is an important contribution to our long-term sales growth. And finally, one of my favorites, which speaks to our culture, our coworkers, and our ability to attract the best talent. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be recognized nationwide. And most recently by Forbes, where we were ranked the number one utility in the U.S. for both America's best employers for women and number one for diversity. Delivering excellence every day continues to position the business for sustainable long-term growth, strong execution leads to strong results. The two are linked. One drives the other. In early August, we experienced one of the worst storms in our company's history. Our team established an incident command structure to deploy resources and took decisive action to restore customers. We had a record number of crews on our system. The speed of our response led to the highest positive customer sentiment we have ever received during a major storm. I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank all our co-workers responded to the call. During the storm, we had more than 3,700 members of our team working around the clock to safely restore customers. Like we do every year, the storms, pandemics, and unseasonal weather, we continue to deliver. And when there's upside, we reinvest, this is the CMS model of responding to changing conditions that allows us to deliver consistently year-after-year. Year-to-date, we've delivered ahead of plan with adjusted earnings per share of $2.18 for continuing operations. Our strong performance coupled with the completion of the EnerBank transaction and the financial flexibility that provides, gives us further confidence in our ability to meet our full year guidance, which we've raised to $2.63 to $2.65 from $2.61 to $2.65 for continuing operations. For 2022, we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.87 per share. In our continued strong performance in 2021 builds momentum for 2022 and beyond. Longer term, we are committed to growing our adjusted EPS toward the high end of our 6% to 8% growth range as we highlighted on our Q2 call. As previously stated, we are committed to growing the dividend in 2022 and beyond. That's what you expect while you own us. And we know it's a big part of our value. As we move forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. Many of you have asked about gas prices and the impact on our business, and more importantly, our customers. Let me tell you about our gas business. We have one of the largest storage fields in the U.S. and compression resources to match. That is a significant advantage. We started putting natural gas into our storage fields in April and continued throughout the summer when natural gas prices were low. Right now our fields are full and we ready to deliver for our customers heating needs throughout the winter months. Most of the gas has already locked in at just under $3 per 1000 cubic feet, which is well below current levels in the spot market and offers tremendous customer value. Given the operational certainty of storage, as well as the financial protection of a pass-through clause, our customers stay safe and warm all winter long and have affordable bills. Heat in Michigan is not an option, and we don\u2019t leave it up to the market. We buy, store and deliver. That\u2019s what we do. Michigan strong regulatory construct is known across the industry as one of the best. It includes the integrated resource plan process, which is a result of legislation, designed to ensure timely recovery of the necessary investments to advance safe, reliable and clean energy in our state. Michigan\u2019s forward looking test years and three-year pre-approvals structure of the IRP process gives visibility on our future growth. It enables the company and the commission to align on long-term generation supply planning and provide certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation. Here\u2019s what I like about our recently filed IRP. There is a win in it for everyone. It is a remarkable plan that addresses many of the interests of our stakeholders. It ensures supply reliability, it reduces costs and it delivers industry-leading carbon emission reductions. It\u2019s clean. We continue to have constructive dialogue with the staff and other stakeholders and we anticipate seeing their positions later today. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick and good morning everyone. I\u2019m pleased to offer the details of another strong quarter of financial performance at CMS as a result of solid execution across the company. As a brief reminder, throughout our materials, we report the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations, thereby removing it as a reportable segment in reporting our quarterly and year-to-date results from continuing operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Now onto the results. For the third quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $156 million or $0.54 per share. The key drivers for the quarter were higher service restoration expenses attributable to the Argus storms that Garrick mentioned and planned increases in other operating and maintenance expenses in support of key customer and operational initiatives. These sources of negative variance for the quarter were partially offset by favorable weather, the continued recovery of commercial and industrial sales in our electric business and higher rate relief net of investment related expenses. Year-to-date we\u2019ve delivered adjusted net income of $628 million or $2.18 per share, which is up $0.19 per share versus the first nine months of 2020, exclusive of EnerBank\u2019s financial performance. All in, we continue to trend ahead of plan and have substantial financial flexibility heading into the fourth quarter. The waterfall chart on Slide 8 provides more detail on key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020. For the first nine months of the year rate relief continues to be the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.45 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses. As a reminder, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment related costs such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs of utility. This upside has been partially offset by the aforementioned storms in the quarter, which drove $0.16 per share of negative variance versus the third quarter of 2020 and $0.11 per share of downside on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable period in 2020. To round out the customer initiatives bucket, planned increases in our operating and maintenance expenses to fund safety, reliability and decarbonization initiatives added the balance of spend for the first nine months of the year, which in addition to the August storm activity added $0.35 per share of negative variance versus a comparable period in 2020. As a reminder, these costs categories are shown net of costs savings realized to date, which is Garrick mentioned, have already exceeded our targets for the year with more upside to come. To close out our year-to-date performance, we also benefited from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $0.07 per share, and another $0.02 per share of upside, largely driven by recovering commercial and industrial load. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we feel quite good about the glide path for delivering on our EPS guidance range, which has been revised upward to $2.63 to $2.65 per share as Garrick noted. As we look ahead, we continue to plan for normal weather, which in this case translates to $0.06 per share of positive variance given the absence of the unfavorable weather experience in the fourth quarter of 2020. We\u2019ll also continue to benefit from the residual impact of our 2020 rate orders, which equates to $0.07 per share, and is not subject to any further MPSC actions. And we\u2019ll make steady progress on our operational and customer related initiatives, which are forecasted to have a financial impact of roughly $0.07 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020. Lastly, we\u2019ll assume the usual conservatism in our utility, non-weather sales assumptions and our non-utility segment performance. All in, we are pleased with our strong execution to date in 2021 and are well positioned for the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 9. I\u2019m pleased to highlight that this year\u2019s financing plan has been completed ahead of schedule. In the third quarter, we issued $300 million of first mortgage bonds at a coupon rate of 2.65%. One of the lowest rates ever achieved at Consumers Energy. We also remarketed $35 million of tax exempt revenue bonds, ahead of this month at a rate of under 1% through 2026. Due to the strong execution implied by these records setting issuances coupled with the EnerBank sale, which provided approximately $60 million of upside relative to the sale price announced at signing. We now have the flexibility to reduce our equity needs for the year, even further, which will now be limited to the $57 million of equity forwards we have already contracted. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before we open it up for Q&A. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis has stood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward. It\u2019s grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders, enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. As we\u2019ve highlighted today, we\u2019ve executed on our commitment to the triple bottom line in the first nine months of the year. We\u2019re pleased to have delivered strong results. We\u2019re positioned well to continue that momentum into the last three months of the year. As we move pass the sale of the bank and continued progress to IRP process. This is an exciting time at CMS Energy. With that Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you very much, Garrick. [Operator Instructions] And today\u2019s first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Constantine Lednev : Hi. Good morning, team. It\u2019s actually Constantine here for Shar. Congrats on a challenging but successful quarter. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Constantine. Constantine Lednev : I have a quick question on the cadence of long-term growth that you reiterated today. So the 2022 guidance implies the top of the range performance, as you mentioned, and kind of you expect to execute at the high-end. And one of the opportunities, obviously the IRP, but that may take some time for approval of execution. Just the 8% growth implies some incremental CapEx for the prior plan or any kind of financing items. And is there any change with a glide path or timing for the offset of kind of the near-term dilution from the business optimizations? Garrick Rochow : Well, let me tag team this with Rejji. But here\u2019s what I\u2019ll offer and here\u2019s what you should hear from this call. High confidence in 2021 and that momentum carries into 2022. And we reaffirmed our guidance for that time period the $2.85 to $2.87. And as we said in previous calls, when I look out at 20 \u2013 office 2022 base, it continues to be at this growth rate of 6% to 8%. And I would expect us to be toward the high end of that. Now, we plan conservatively and in Q4 we\u2019ll provide our capital plan. We expect that capital plan to grow with the things you would be familiar with the gas system, the electric system and the supply system. However, the IRP and particularly the Covert plant in 2023 and the dig assets in 2025 are upside to that plan. And once we have complete certainty on and that IRP process and those provide the opportunity for upside to the plan. And so, I mean, that\u2019s the \u2013 there\u2019s a great deal of confidence that I have about this five-year window, I\u2019m going to look at from 2021 through 2025. But certainly, Rejji jump in to add some additional context. Rejji Hayes : Well, Garrick, I think you laid it out well. And Constantine, the only thing I would add just to give you a bit more specifics around the numbers. So our current plan that we\u2019re executing on for five years or 2021 through 2025 is about $13.2 billion. We have not changed that, but we are assuming that we\u2019ll increase that by about $1 billion next year in the next vintage into Garrick\u2019s comments that does not presuppose any outcome for the IRP. And there\u2019s about $1.3 billion of additional capital investment opportunities that is on the outside looking in, which just gives us more confidence in the plan. We also are not planning to issue equity. And so there\u2019s a funding efficiency that will also be accretive to our financial performance as we see it. And what\u2019s also not in a plan from a capital investment perspective that Garrick offered in his prepared remarks was a voluntary green pricing program that we got approval on, which offers about 1 gigawatt of capital investment opportunities, specifically renewable spend that we would own from 2024 through 2027. And so all of that\u2019s on the outside looking in, so you can see why we have great confidence in our ability to deliver towards that high end off of the 2022 base. Constantine Lednev : Perfect. I think that\u2019s very comprehensive. And maybe just shifting to the regulatory process for bid. Just on the IRP, can you talk about how you\u2019re building kind of some of the stakeholder comfort with the kind of asset retirement and reg asset treatment and the kind of the mechanisms that you\u2019re proposing? Does any of the thinking changed around the generation portfolio in light of the commodity shifts that we have seen? Garrick Rochow : Well, I\u2019ll offer this one. Just credit to the team here at Consumers Energy and CMS Energy. There\u2019s been an extensive stakeholder process and engagement with staff, with interveners, with the public that\u2019s led up to the filing and has continued through the filing process. And so I feel really confident about that. The messages and the testimony are strong and solid and will yield really good outcomes. But in my prepared remarks, I said, there\u2019s a win in this for everyone. And I really believe that. When you look at this plan, our 2018-2019 IRP was a great plan. This is even better. The resiliency and reliability of our electric supply, we\u2019ve done the modeling. It\u2019s more reliable plan in the past. It\u2019s more affordable, $650 million of savings in this plan over the previous plan. And we cut carbon emissions by 60% by 2025, well ahead of the Paris Accord, the equivalent of taking 12.5 cars off the road. And from my stage point \u2013 standpoint here in the regulatory asset treatment, as I shared in the Q2 call, great testimony, and I think we\u2019re going to have a constructive dialogue, and certainly a supportive dialogue we\u2019ll see this afternoon in the intervener comments. And so there is a win in here for everyone. And when there\u2019s a win in there for everyone, there\u2019s a great path to a great outcome. And I believe that we saw that in 2018 and 2019. And so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing staff and interveners testimony this afternoon, it\u2019s going to be supportive. It will be balanced, it\u2019ll be constructive. And were there differences? We\u2019ve done that before, just looking at our 2018, 2019 IRP. I feel good about where we\u2019re at in the process. Constantine Lednev : Perfect. Thank you. That\u2019s very comprehensive. Then I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Congrats. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good morning. Just want to pick up on the CapEx side here and just wanted to see how you thinking about going to hardening investments at this point? And specifically, do you think in reaction to the storms this summer, we could kind of see more movement on this side? Garrick Rochow : Let me offer this. As I shared in my prepared remarks, we had a great response during the storm and I\u2019ll be really clear. The fact pattern of storms has been different across the state. We\u2019ve had one major storm. But if you stand back and look at the big picture and look forward from a strategy perspective, there certainly is a call for greater resiliency and grid hardening. And that\u2019s an opportunity, opportunity from an investment perspective and an opportunity to create greater value for our customers. And so I think there\u2019s a couple of thing driving that. One, we\u2019re seeing more severe weather, not just in Michigan, but across the U.S. And so that is certainly a driver in the equation. And then two, when we think about this transition to electric vehicles and be able to support those vehicles, not only do we need the capacity out there to be able to do that, but also we want to ensure that when we do have an interruption in service, today it\u2019s just the refrigerator, tomorrow it\u2019s the refrigerator and the EV and their ability to get to work. That\u2019s a whole new standard of performance. And so again, big picture perspective looking at for the future, I see this as an opportunity and inflection point where we spend more time and thinking about resiliency and grid hardening. I\u2019ll share one last point on this. I\u2019ve had the opportunity post-storm to talk with the governor to talk with the chair scripts and I can\u2019t speak for them, but certainly a positive direction when we talk about how do we design the grid for the future, with climate change and with severe weather in mind. And so again, it\u2019s an opportunity for investors and an opportunity to create additional value for our customers. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for that. And maybe just thinking about load as we exit the pandemic here. Just wondering if you could provide thoughts, I guess, as far as trends by class and really on the residential side, how you\u2019re seeing, I guess, stickiness there and just any thoughts that you could share on that side? Rejji Hayes : Yes. Jeremy, this is Rejji. I can offer some color there. And we do have a slide in our appendix of the presentation, which is helpful, Slide 13 I\u2019ll point you to also the detailed 15 Page Digest, also some good content on load. But what I can say at a very high level is we continued to be encouraged by the residential weather normalized load we\u2019re seeing. So, you probably saw a year-to-date down roughly 2%, but that certainly compares favorable to plan where we assumed a more aggressive return to facilities for workers. And so we do think that this sort of hybrid format or mass teleworking trend should carry on and potentially be part of a new normal. And so in our budget, we had much more bearish expectations. This year we actually thought there\u2019d be a quicker recovery and you see this down 2%, that\u2019s an excess of plan and so we see performance to the upside there. And then we also compare it to the pre-pandemic level and relative to 2019, we\u2019re up about 2.5%. And so we do think there\u2019s a very nice bit of resiliency to the residential load. And again, it offers a higher margin relative to the other customer classes as you know. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Insoo Kim at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. It\u2019s Rebecca on for Insoo. Thanks for taking our questions. So for the ALJ decision on your rate case, it was roughly 25% of your requested revenue increase. So can you describe which items constitute the difference? And then if this gets adopted, would this impact your 2022 and 2023 growth trajectory? Garrick Rochow : Well, I\u2019ll offer this. I really view this PFD from the ALJ as a bookend. And Michigan\u2019s constructive regulatory environment and this commission and previous commissions have really shown a balanced and constructive approach. And I can\u2019t speak for the commissioners, but my interaction with the commissioners would suggest this, that they believe and support healthy utilities, good outcomes from electric and gas rate cases. And when you have those and similar goals, it leads to good outcomes. And so I view we\u2019re going to get an outcome in this electric order that\u2019s in December, that\u2019s both constructive and balanced, good for Michigan\u2019s residents, Michigan \u2013 our customers, and frankly, good for CMS Energy. But Rejji if you want to just jump into some of the differences. Rejji Hayes : Yes. Rebecca, thanks for the question. So what I would add there is you do have a few sources, or I\u2019ll say buckets of variants that lead to that delta between what we requested and where the PFD ended up. And so I would say cost of capital is a component. So we asked for 10.5% ROE, the ALJ was at 9.7%. And so that makes up a good portion of the difference. Also you see a difference in equity thickness. And so we were at 52% equity relative to debt and the PFD was about a point lower than that I call it 51% and change. And so those are the primary sources of difference. There also were differences in opinion on the capital required to really strengthen and harden the system. And so I think, if memory serves me, there was about $0.25 billion of capital investments that we were proposing for resiliency and reliability, which obviously we think is critically important, particularly on the heels of the August storm activity we saw. And we saw that also as a recommended disallowance of future spend. And so I\u2019d say those are the major buckets there. And I think once you normalize for the prevailing ROE and equity thickness, you start to tighten that gap, but it\u2019s primarily those buckets. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks. And then for the EDIP, how much of that is in your five-year base plan and would that be incremental to your rate base or earnings growth? Rejji Hayes : I\u2019m sorry. I missed the first part you said for your what? Unidentified Analyst : EDIP filing in your five-year base plan. Rejji Hayes : Yes. So the $4 billion that does a lot of capital to be clear, the $4 billion of capital attributable to the EDIP and further we announced that there is the electric distribution infrastructure investment plan that does align. With the spend rate we\u2019ve been on for some time, and so in our current five-year capital plan of $13.2 billion, about $5.5 billion of that is attributable to electric distribution. And so we\u2019re on this sort of run rate of over $1 billion a year \u2013 $1 billion per year of capital investment. And we think that\u2019s appropriate to balance resilience, reliability, as well as affordability. And so that\u2019s effectively what this EDIP propose is. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks so much. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Hey, good morning, guys. Garrick Rochow : Good morning. Jonathan Arnold : Can you just Rejji you mentioned on the roll forward of the capital clan, you would do probably \u2013 probably about $1 billion associated with that. Could you just \u2013 is that the voluntary green pricing being rolled in? Is it something else? Would the VGP be incremental may a little more color on that comment? Rejji Hayes : Yes. Sure, Jonathan. So to be clear the $1 billion that we\u2019ll likely add to our next five-year plan from 2022 to 2026, that does not include the VGP and the opportunity there for that gigawatt of renewables, nor does it include any of the potential capital investment opportunity associated with the IRP. What it will likely entail is as you may recall, we had when we rolled out our ten-year plan and say the back half of 2019, if memory serves me, we said we had about $3 million to $4 billion of upside capital investment opportunities, which were not part of that 10 year $25 billion plan. And it largely had to do with electric and gas infrastructure modernization. And so those will be the likely components that are added to the capital plan going forward and represent that call it roughly $1 billion of upside. I also think we\u2019re going to obviously roll forward our IRP related solar investments that are part of just the existing IRP that we\u2019re executing on. So you\u2019ll probably see some of that come into the plan as well as we add another year to our five-year rolling CapEx plan. Is that helpful. Jonathan Arnold : Yes, very helpful, Rejji. So said another way that $3 billion to $4 billion is still there, despite the VGP and the IRP. Rejji Hayes : That\u2019s exactly right. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. And then can I just push, you mentioned that the VGP is already oversubscribed. Give us any flavor of sort of by how much, and what\u2019s the pathway to potentially expanding that? Garrick Rochow : Well, I\u2019d offer this one. Some of those are non-disclosure agreements, but just some public announcements, on Earth Day of this year, I was with the governor and we were announced that we were supporting the state facilities and they\u2019re moved to renewable energy. So that\u2019s an example. I\u2019ll share with you that I was with a large customer just yesterday the global company, and they were looking at their large manufacturing facilities here in Michigan and looking at renewable type options. And so we're seeing a definite directional \u2013 direction in terms of sustainability among our large industrial customers, and this serves their needs. And so I'm not going to get into how much or from an oversubscription standpoint, but hopefully those examples provide some color on the context of opportunity there. Rejji Hayes : And Jonathan, the only thing I would add is if the spirit of your question is whether there will be sufficient demand for that gigawatt of opportunity, that we certainly feel very competent that there'll be requisite demand to meet the gigawatt of opportunity for the voluntary program. Jonathan Arnold : The question was a bit more if you're oversubscribed, how are you \u2013 you need to add to it in order to keep \u2013 having those conversations. Garrick Rochow : And as we see it, that's what the voluntary green program would offer up about a gigawatt of additional capacity that we would own in the form of most likely solar new builds. Rejji Hayes : So at this point, I mean to answer your question, Jonathan, and at this point, we don't need to add to it. There's some runway there and we'd look to construct these renewable assets in the 24 to 27 timeline. So it's oversubscribed from what we have right now, and this will make up a good portion of that 1,000 megawatts, but there's more room to grow over there. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Michael Sullivan at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Michael Sullivan : Hey, good morning, everyone. I'm sorry to put you on the spot a little bit here, but just seeing some of these filing start to come in on the IRP looks like some of the environmental parties pushing back on the gas plant additions, I guess, is that surprising to you guys at all? And ways to kind of come to some sort of agreement with them path forward. Any thoughts there? Garrick Rochow : I would offer this, when I say there's a wind in there forever one. It's clear that the environmental community loves the fact that we're eliminating coal and would like natural gas not to be the substitute, but here's what we know that the only way that you can deliver the resiliency and the supply side of the business and make sure we don't have an interruption in service, like was evident in Texas is to have natural gas as part of the solution. And so like I said, the staff and the other interveners are certainly mindful of the resiliency and the importance of natural gas within the state. So there's a lot of give and take within these. And I would just offer this in 2018. And in 2019 we had a lot of different points of view from an intervener perspective and we settled that case. And so differences are expected and we worked through those just like we have done and we have a track record of doing that. Michael Sullivan : Makes sense. And just sticking with the IRP, the other key focus area, I think you touched on a little, was the regulatory asset treatment at any parties in particular, you would expect to maybe push back on that. Initially, as we start to see the testimony. Garrick Rochow : Again, I would offer this and you have said this on the Q2 call and in other settings, this is an integrated resource plan and it's not a buffet. We've put together a great plan for Michigan. There was a winning in it for everyone. And so, we've been really clear about the need for recovery of, and on the asset. And so going forward, I mean, that's part of the plan and we've got testimony to support that. And as I stated earlier, when there's a win in there for everyone, there's a path to a good order and a good outcome. And so where there is differences, we have shown \u2013 we have the ability to work with everyone. And so again, I just see a nice positive outcome here in next year in 2022. Michael Sullivan : Great, thanks. Thanks a lot, Garrick. Operator : Next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the time. Appreciate the opportunity to connect. So just in brief, if we can talk about the supportive commentary you brought up a moment ago around the testimony here, can you elaborate a little bit of specifically what your expectations are this afternoon and perhaps more specifically as you stated supportive, I imagine that you see across latitude towards the settlement here. I just want to make sure I'm acquainting one towards the other, right. I mean in terms of what this translates to next in terms of order, Garrick Rochow : Well, I would offer this. I mean, I don't have a visibility into the testimony until it's published. And so, I mean, obviously we had a great discussion with number of the interveners. We know some of their points of view where there might be good support and where there might be small differences. And so again, I would reflect on it this way. Again, we've done this in the past many times and rate cases and the like, and we've certainly done this with an IRP where there's differences. We find a way to work through those. And again, I think this afternoon, we're going to see, and I look forward to reading it. I think we're going to see supportive comments in general. And so when, again, when there's a winning in there for everyone, there's a path to a successful outcome. Now, I don't know if it's going to go down the path of settlement or we'll take it to the full order. But again, when there's a win there, there's an opportunity for success and that's what I'm confident about. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right. And then just coming back to the rate case a little bit here, given the discrepancy between the ALJ and the staff, does that inform your strategy heading into your next filing here in Q1 at all? I mean, obviously there's some specific deltas there that you alluded to a moment ago, Rejji, but can you, can you elaborate a little bit more and maybe how you move forward, especially in the next cases, if there's anything yet? Garrick Rochow : This is a constructive regulatory environment. Julien, you know that, I know that and I really see this PFD as a bookend, as I stated earlier. And so the conversations that we have with staff in outside of cases is really how do we continue to ensure a safe and reliable natural gas system? How do we ensure and bring clean energy to Michigan? How do we ensure the reliability and resiliency in electric grid? And so those are in line with our goals and what we want to do as well. And so, we'll continue to be thoughtful about that process to make sure we balance customer's affordability with that. But I don't see any real change in plans as a result of a specific ALJ, PFD at all. Rejji Hayes : And Julien, this is Rejji. The only thing I would add is, at the end of the day, it also speaks to just the benefit of the Michigan regulatory construct and the legislation in that. Any event there is misalignment because ultimately at the end of the day, the commission's order will dictate where we end up. But in the event, there is a misalignment, there's a forward-looking test here. And so obviously we have not incurred the expenses on the capital or the O&M side. And so if we see misalignment in terms of where we'd like to go versus where the commission ends up, where we can toggle the capital and spend program accordingly. So again, it just speaks to the constructive nature, not just of decisions we've seen in the past, but also the rate construct and the legislation itself. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, I hear you bookend is the keyword here, actually, guys, best of luck. We'll speak soon. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Julien. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Travis Miller at Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller : Good morning. Thank you. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Travis. Travis Miller : I have two questions going back to the storms. First one is in your discussions that you referenced with regulators, governor either within or outside of the rate cases, there've been any talk in addition to some of the public comments about fines or penalties or other kinds of pushback on the storm response. That's my first question. And then the second question was the 16 funds. Can you kind of break that down in terms of how you offset that to stay on track with the guidance and for this year? Garrick Rochow : Well, two part, this one between Rejji , take the second question and I'll take the first piece. I would offer this, one again, conversation with the governor's office in which chair scripts have been constructive. And again, I don't want to speak for the chair, but I would offer this, the commission has been supportive of both our electric reliability spend as of recent the capital investments, as well as increased forestry spend. We increased our forestry spend this year by little over 60%, and that was supported through a rate case process by the commission and the commissioners understand that we're in the first year, that the number one cause for outages is tree trimming. And we have a very aggressive program now in place, which will benefit our customers. And so our commissioners, I believe, understand that we're in the early years of these larger investments and operational maintenance expense, which will help our customers. And so I think there's full recognition of that. I have not heard any talk at all, zero from the governor's office or from the commission on any sort of penalties associated with the storms in August. Travis Miller : Okay, great. Rejji Hayes : And Travis, the only thing I would add is with respect to the $0.16 of negative variance that I noted my prepared remarks for Q3 of this year versus Q3 of last year, it was in large part offset as a result of just good weather we saw throughout quarter, it was quite warm the month of August and that offset a lot of the incremental service restoration costs that were incurred. And I also want to give credit \u2013 where credit is due. I think the fact that we've already exceeded our expectations on cost savings across the organization was also quite helpful in offsetting some of the service restoration. And then lastly, again, as I mentioned, residential down 2% year-to-date, roughly versus year-to-date last year, but it's ahead of plan two. And so you've got a little favorable mix as well versus plan. So all of those factors have largely offset the service restoration expense that we saw in Q3. Travis Miller : Yes. Thanks. And then just a quick clarification on the $0.16 that was incremental to plan, or did that include typical storm related expenses? I assume you include\u2026 Rejji Hayes : Yes, the $0.16 was incremental to Q3 of 2020. So it's just \u2013 that's a historical comp and that's what that estimate is predicated on versus plant, a little higher than planned. But remember, in addition to having a decent amount of service restoration in our budget, we also utilize some regulatory mechanisms both what we call a voluntary refund mechanism that we put in place at the end of 2020 that provided additional budgetary support. And then we also shared a gain on the sale of some assets related to our transmission assets in 2020, but offered additional I\u2019d say regulatory liabilities to support that provide additional budgetary installation of the service restoration this year. Travis Miller : Okay, great. Thanks so much, appreciate the details. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead. Ryan Levine : Good morning. So one on financing proposal, in your plan it looks you reduced your equity needs for this year by about $43 million. Can you walk us through what\u2019s the driver of that and how much is really contributed to the purchase price adjustment for the recent asset sale and if there is any other factors that are driving that number if there is some conservatism baked to that? Garrick Rochow : Hey, Ryan, thanks for the question. So the EnerBank sale gross proceeds and the upside associated there was the key driver that enabled us to reduce our equity financing needs the year and the way it works. And it's a little nuanced I've been doing M&A for almost 20 years, but for Fincos or financial service companies, you have your traditional adjustments from signed to close on a working capital side, but from a financial service companies, you also get credit if the book equity of the business increases from signed to close, and we saw that with EnerBank\u2019s outperformance over those handful of months. And so that led to about $60 million of upside from the gross proceeds we announced at signing which was $960 million, not to the amount that we ultimately saw at closing, which was over $1 billion, call it, just under $1.20 billion. And so that's what gave us the upside and financial flexibility to reduce the equity needs. And so it's really a function of just that really strong performance at the bank that it created their book equity that gave us more proceeds at close. Ryan Levine : I mean, that's a bigger number than the amount of equity you reduced. Is there some conservative baked into your reduction in equity needs or is this effectively a few million dollars worth of pre-funding of future equity needs or future capital needs? Garrick Rochow : Yes. So remember we have about $57 million of equity forwards that we've already put in place. And we have been putting those in place even before we announced the sale of the bank. And so that gives you effectively a four for how low you're going to go, because at some point we will settle that. And so that's why we stopped at that sort of $57 million. It's because of the existing equity forwards we already have in place. Ryan Levine : Okay, great. So I guess that helps you for future years for capital needs. Appreciate it. That's all I have. Garrick Rochow : Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I like to turn the conference back over to Garrick Rochow for closing remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Rocco. And I'd like to thank you all again for joining us today. We're looking forward to seeing you at EEI in the near future here and take care and stay safe. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

The earnings release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call beginning today at 12 :00 P.M. Eastern Time and will be viewed February 2022. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, President and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sri Maddipati : Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that the team continued to deliver strong performance in 2021, demonstrating consistent results across the triple bottom line for our coworkers, customers, communities, and you, our investors. Allow me to take a few minutes to share the big wins this team accomplished in 2021. It is a point of pride that CMS was named the number one utility in the U.S. by Forbes for women and for workplace diversity. It starts with our coworkers and we know that companies that value and practice diversity, equity and inclusion deliver stronger performance. Our commitment to people, our coworkers and customers was in high year all year. For our coworkers, we delivered the 11th straight year of first quartile employee engagement. For our customers, we delivered first quartile customer experience, unlocks several programs, which support our most vulnerable and prepare all for a cleaner future with EVs and renewable energy generation. This year's highlights include the expansion of our Voluntary Green Pricing program, which allows for an incremental 1,000 megawatts of owned renewables and our PowerMIFleet EV program to meet the demand of Michigan businesses governments and schools as they electrify their fleet. And just this week, we announced along with General Motors, the plan to power three existing auto plants with 100% clean energy through our Voluntary Green Pricing program. And I know \u2013 Yes. Yes, I know all of you want to hear about our IRP. Our clean energy plan, also known as our IRP, places us in a solid leadership position on the transformation to clean energy. It has us out of coal by 2025, which achieves 60% carbon emissions reduction. I am pleased with the progress we are seeing in the regulatory process. I look forward to landing the IRP in 2022. I also want to share the progress we have made with our gas system. Our commitment to be Net Zero methane by 2030 is industry leading. We are making our gas system safer and cleaner by replacing older mains and services with modern materials. This year, we reduced use methane emissions by more than 445 metric tons and executed on our best year ever for main replacement. This stand to reduce methane extends beyond our system with exciting new programs, which will make a positive impact on the planet. We recently announced a plan to build and own our first renewable natural gas facility with a Michigan dairy farm, which is included in our pending gas rate case. This facility would be a regulated asset and the emissions reduction will remove the equivalent of 4,000 gasoline-fueled vehicles from the road annually. Clearly, we are on our way to a safe and clean gas system. Finally, I want to talk a little bit about Michigan, our home state, our service territory. In both our gas and electric business, we are seeing new service connections up over 2020 and 2019 above pre-pandemic levels. In fact, we have not seen this level of new electric service connections in the last 10 years. We also attracted 105 megawatts of new industrial loads to our service territory, which brings with it 4,000 new jobs and more than $1 billion of investment. And we are expecting even more new load growth in the state. The work we did at the end of the year on two important growth mechanisms further enhances, Michigan's competitive position.  We filed an economic development rate in November, which was quickly approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission in December. We also work closely with the legislature, business groups and the Governor's office on a package of economic development incentive bill that passed with bipartisan support signed by our Governor in December. With these improvements, I expect further announcements this year on several new projects. For you, our investors, I'm pleased to share we delivered our financial targets with another year of 7% adjusted EPS growth. We continued our long track record of managing costs and keeping prices affordable through the CE Way, $55 million of cost savings were realized in 2021. When I step back and reflect on 2021, it is this strong execution and results that you and we expect, and it meets our commitment to the triple bottom line, positioning our business for sustainable long-term growth. Strong execution leads to strong results and 2021 marks another year of premium growth. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 in 2021 at the high end of our guidance range and up 7% from 2020. And in January, the Board approved an annual dividend increase to $1.84 per share. In addition to raising our annual dividend in 2022, I'm pleased to share that we are raising our 2022 adjusted full-year guidance of $2.85 to $2.89 from $2.85 to $2.87 per share. I am confident in our plan for 2022 and our long-standing ability to manage the work and deliver industry-leading growth. Longer-term, we remain committed to growing adjusted EPS on the high end of our 6% to 8% growth range. Looking forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. And finally, I'm pleased to share that we have rolled forward our five-year utility customer investment plan, increasing our prior plan by over $1 billion to $14.3 billion through 2026. On Slide 5, we've highlighted our new five-year $14.3 billion customer investment plan. This translates 7% annual rate base growth and supports the two key focus areas of our strategy, making our electric and gas systems safer and more reliable and paving the way with clean energy future with Net Zero carbon and methane emissions. You will note that about 40% of our investment mix is aimed at renewable generation, grid modernization and main and service replacement on our gas system that support the clean energy transformation. Furthermore, we continue to increase our investments in what our customers count on us for every single day, safe and reliable electric and natural gas systems. You will also see that we continue to plan conservatively and have ample upside in projects not factored in this plan, such as our IRP and Voluntary Green Pricing program. We remain focused on the regulatory process as we make investment on behalf of our customers. In December, we received an order in our electric rate case. It offered several opportunities for us to improve our case process, and we are hard at work as we prepare our next phase. This order did support our plan by maintaining our existing 9.9% ROE, increasing our regulatory equity ratio by 34 basis points and approving $54 million in revenue requirement exclusive of $27 million of lower depreciation approved prior to the order. We expect to file our next electric rate case early this year and anticipate an initial order in our IRP in April, and a final order in our gas rate case is expected by October. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2021 with adjusted net income of $767 million or $2.65 per share, up 7% year-over-year of our 2020 results. I'll note that our adjusted EPS excludes select nonrecurring items, most notably the financial performance of EnerBank, the gain on the sale and related transaction costs, all of which are disclosed in the reconciliation schedule in the appendix of this presentation and posted on our website. The key drivers of our full year financial performance in 2021 were rate relief, net of investments, coupled with strong volumetric sales in our electric business. These sources a positive variance were partially offset by increased operating and maintenance expenses in support of key customer initiatives related to safety, reliability and decarbonization, and higher service restoration costs from storm activity. To this last point on storms, we saw a record level of storms across Michigan in 2021, particularly in the final five months of the year, including December, and we still managed to deliver at the high end of our EPS guidance range.  Our ability to withstand such headwinds quite literally in the case of 2021, and deliver the financial results you've come to expect highlights our track record of planning conservatively, managing the work and relying on the perennial will of our dedicated coworkers. We deliver on the triple bottom line irrespective of the conditions. Moving beyond EPS, on Slide 8, you'll note that we met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. It is worth noting that even with the aforementioned headwinds, we still managed to deliver over $1.8 billion of operating cash flow, which exceeded our plan by over $80 million due to strong working capital management.  The only financial target missed in 2021 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility, which was budgeted for roughly $2.5 billion and we ended the year just shy of that at $2.3 billion, primarily due to the timing of select renewable projects, which were largely pushed into 2022 and 2023. To close the books on 2021, we successfully completed our financing plan ahead of schedule, as noted during our third quarter earnings call issuing no equity during the year, given the EnerBank sales while maintaining solid investment-grade credit metrics. Moving to our 2022 guidance, on Slide 9, we are raising our 2022 adjusted earnings guidance to $2.85 to $2.89 per share from $2.85 to $2.87 per share, which implies premium annual growth of our 2021 results, as Garrick highlighted. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility as it has in the past several years. And we also anticipate a return to normal operations in enterprises whose financial performance in 2021 was largely impacted by an extended outage at DIG late in the fourth quarter. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on Slide 10, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.01 per share of positive year-over-year variance. Additionally, we anticipate $0.05 of EPS pickup attributable to rate relief net of investment costs, largely driven by our recent electric rate order and the expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas case later this year. As a reminder, we also continue to see the residual effects of tax benefits from our 2020 gas rate settlement. As we look at our cost structure in 2022, you'll note approximately $0.21 per share of positive variance attributable to continued cost savings from productivity driven by the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives as well as a return to more normalized levels of service restoration expense. As noted earlier, we're also assuming a resumption of normalized operating conditions in enterprises in the ultimate bar on the right-hand side of the chart, coupled with usual conservative assumptions around weather-normalized sales. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions and circumstances throughout the year to mitigate risk and increase the likelihood of meeting our operational and financial objectives. Moving to Slide 11, which denotes our near and long term financial objectives. In addition to the adjusted earnings and dividend per share target that Garrick noted earlier, from a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings, and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly. To that end, given the attractive valuation achieved in the EnerBank sale and our successful closing of the transaction in the fourth quarter, we do not anticipate issuing any equity through 2024, despite the increase in our five-year customer investment plan for $14.3 billion. Beyond 2024, we expect to issue up to $250 million of equity per year in 2025 and 2026. As for 2022 financings, our needs are limited to debt issuances at the utility and the settlement of existing equity forward contracts, the details of which you can find in the appendix of our presentation. Our model is served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices, while our coworkers remain engaged, well trained and empowered in our purpose-driven organization. And our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance. We're often asked whether we can sustain our consistent industry-leading growth in the long term, given widespread concerns about inflation, supply chain and natural gas prices, among other risks. And our answer remains the same, irrespective of the circumstances, we view it as our job to do the waring for you. Sustainable and agile cost management has been one of the key pillars of our success over the past several years. And as you can see in the breakout of our cost structure on Slide 12, there remain ample opportunities to reduce costs across the business. As you'll note on the right-hand side of the slide, we estimate over $200 million of episodic cost savings opportunities through coal facility retirements and the expiration of high-priced power purchase agreements, or PPAs.  In fact, our PPA with the Palisades Nuclear their facility will expire in April of this year, which will provide approximately $90 million of savings to our customers. These cost savings are above and beyond what we'll aim to achieve annually largely through the CE Way, our lean operating system, which, as Garrick noted earlier, was a key driver in our achievement of $55 million in cost savings in 2021 and $100 million worth in 2020. Given our track record of reducing costs, we're highly confident that we'll be able to execute our capital plan, delivering substantial value for customers and invest. To conclude my remarks, on Slide 13, we have refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimum. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before Q&A. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis has withstood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward. It is grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders and enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. As we've highlighted today, we have achieved another year of strong performance in 2021, executing on our commitment with triple bottom line and are pleased with our strong results. I'm confident we're in a great position to continue our momentum throughout 2022 and beyond. We look forward to updating you as we head into another exciting year. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Garrick Rochow : Good morning. Shar Pourreza : Good morning. Good stuff this morning. A couple of questions here if I may, first, Garrick, you're guiding to the top end of 6% to 8%, which was kind of a change in language post transformation, and now you kind of break out more details the upside potential for non-IRP CapEx. Just to confirm, is this upside included in the updated language around the growth rate? Maybe another way to ask is if you're already at the top end you have $4 billion to $5 billion of incremental spending items within sort of outside of the IRP. How do we think about this growth rate in the context of the upside spending opportunities you're highlighting this morning? Garrick Rochow : Yes, great question, Shar. And let me offer this just real clarity and offer a little bit of context. And so we're pleased with 2021 and delivering the high end of guidance. And as I shared previously, we've got a lot of momentum coming into 2022, and our raise in guidance should offer much confidence to the investment community on our strength here in 2022 and our confidence in the delivery in 2022. I'll remind you that our 6% to 8%, again, towards the high end of that range, that's off a 2022 base. So that's our projection going forward. We plan conservatively. And so again, you see a lot of upside in that capital plan, the IRP, the VGP type work. And so again, we'll weave those in as those materialize, we don't want to presume excess in those. That's why we are playing conservatively. But again, we expect to be the high end of that 2022 base. And so that's the nature of our growth pattern going forward. And I don't know, Rejji, do you want to offer some additional comments there as well? Rejji Hayes : Good morning Shar, thanks for the question. The only thing I would add to Garrick's comment is just to be \u2013 or I guess, for the avoidance of doubt is that the guidance toward the high-end of 6% to 8% of the 2022 base, that just assumes the capital plan we rolled there today of $14.3 billion of that five-year period, and the assumption of no equity through 2024. And so these other opportunities on the outside looking at the end of the year accounted the IRP, the bond segment pricing program of AGP, those would give us a more confidence in delivering on that plan. So again delivery towards the high-end of 2022 is just based on the $14.3 billion of capital and the assumption of no equity through 2024. Those are the key drivers. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then just to follow up. The rate base growth for 2026 is now 7%. It's a little bit of a slight change from prior year's language of \u201cgreater than 7%\u201d, it's subtle. Is there sort of a lot of large numbers taking effect here just as we're thinking about modeling? Rejji Hayes : Yes. You certainly do have that because we're compounding off of a higher base, but it's a solid 7%, Shar. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. And then just lastly for me, in terms of the disclosure for 2025 through 2026 on the equity side, obviously, you're restoring back the historical $250 million per year. I'm sure, Rejji, you're thinking about this, but do you see sort of any opportunities to maybe mitigate, find some optimization on the financing side, given that you're predominantly 100% regulated, maybe a way to flex the balance sheet and credit metrics? Is there a way you can offset this? Rejji Hayes : We'll see. I mean, the current base case for modeling purposes should be $250 million per year in 2025 and 2026. But what you'll see in the appendix chart is we are assuming about over $10.5 billion of operating cash flow generation over the next five-years. And so if we see upside to that, well, that certainly gives us more financial flexibility. We've also really done a nice job executing very attractive, I'll say, equity-like securities that get an equity like the hybrids we've been doing from time-to-time. We had a perpetual preferred last year. They got nice equity credit. And we'll see if there are opportunities there. But the current working assumption should be that $350 million per year in those averages in 2025 and 2026. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. Congrats on the execution. It's really good. Thanks. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Garrick Rochow : Good morning. How are you Jeremy? Jeremy Tonet : Good, thanks. It seems very clear from the slides there's various CapEx upside that we could see. But just wondering if you could dive in a little bit more for the timing on when these items could make the way into plan and what we should be watching for there? Garrick Rochow : I assume you're talking about the incremental items and just to clarify your question? Jeremy Tonet : Yes, the incremental CapEx opportunity. Garrick Rochow : Certainly. So as you know, we're in the midst of an integrated resource plan, and we don't want to presume, although we're confident in that plan. We don't want to presume the Covert facility and the big facility will move into the utility there's certainly a lot of pretty good indicators around that. But nonetheless, we want to make sure that that's where it lands. And we'll see a final order in the IRP by June of this year. And so again, assuming success there, we would anticipate the Covert facility in 2023 and then the DIG facilities out in 2025 from an incremental opportunity. Our VGP, again, that's subscription-based, based on customers. We saw some positive traction in that, we announced this week with General Motors. But again, that construction would be \u2013 as those fill out and those are subscribed, that construction period would be in 2024 to 2027. And so that's the nature of \u2013 as that materializes, it would show up in that range. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And if these come to fruition, would this impact, I guess, the funding plan on the equity side? Rejji Hayes : Jeremy, this is Rejji. For now, again, we feel good about the funding plan. And we had said before, in the event the IRP gets approved, we don't believe we need to materially change our equity issuance needs. Now the VGP plus the IRP, if we have those high-class problems, we would potentially have to recalibrate. But to be clear, that would only be outside of 2024. And so you think about the timing of the capital investments, Covert would potentially be before 2024. And again, we feel good about not needing to issue equity even in that scenario before 2024, where we may need to recalibrate as if \u2013 we get the IRP and good momentum on the VGP. Those outer years 2025 and beyond, we may have to take a second look there. But for now, again, we feel very good about the work assumptions of this plan. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. And just a quick last one, if I could. With regards to the electric rate case here, the outcome might have been a bit lighter than expected. And just wondering if you could comment a bit more, I guess, on the go-forward expectations in Michigan as far as the regulatory construct there as well as the specific drivers in 2022 that you're using to employ to kind of offset some of that softness? Garrick Rochow : Rejji and I will take team this. Let me be very clear. I feel good about the regulatory construct here in Michigan. And when I look at this rate case, there are two things to take away from it. One, there's an investor read-through on a strong and constructive ROE, 9.9%. That has been constructive, especially when compared with other jurisdictions. It's good solid equity thickness. In fact, our regulatory equity ratio grew by 34 basis points. That just, again, speaks to the nature of this commission in this regulatory construct. And again, all based in legislation, so don't forget that piece of it as well. The other piece of opportunity is clear in the order. And as a utility, we need to improve our business cases particularly in a forward-looking test year and the additional investments we want to make on behalf of our customer. We need to do a better job of showing the benefits as well as the cost when compared to historical. That's on us. We own that and you can expect to see it in our next electric rate case. So let me hand it over to Rejji to walk through a little bit of why we have such confidence in 2022. Rejji Hayes : Jeremy, so as you think about the offset with the order or from the order, clearly, it really highlights the benefits of having a forward test year. And so where we had disallowances in that forward test year, we obviously can revise our capital and spend programs. And so that's a clear offset from some of the disallowances we saw. And then a couple of things related to 2021 and then in this test year so that gives us great confidence. And so as you may recall, we had plans to issue equity in 2021. And obviously, given the timing of the EnerBank sale, we didn't have to issue any equity that year.  And so we've got some momentum from a share count perspective. That's helpful. I continue to feel quite good about weather-normalized load. We saw a really nice recovery from commercial and industrial sales over the course of 2021, and we anticipate seeing some of that in 2022 as well, particularly given the leading indicators that we've seen with respect to new service requests, which Garrick offered in his prepared remarks, and we continue to see upside from our residential customers given the sort of teleworking phenomenon that we think should stick to some extent. And then cost performance. Every year, I continue to be surprised to the upside by what the organization can deliver. So last year, our plan was about $45 million. and we delivered $55 million there. And then in 2020, I can assure you we didn't plan for $100 million of savings in the organization went and got it. And so those are all the drivers that we think will offset some of the downs that we saw in the electric rate order. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Insoo Kim : Yes. Thank you. My first question, you guys dealt with a lot of storms, especially in 2021. And I think in the last rate case, they were also just conversations about potential spending capital opportunities versus just use the expensing to \u2013 for restoration and whatnot. Did the more string of storms more recently identify any additional needs on the capital side that you think could be added to your go-forward plans? Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Insoo, and good morning. I want to be real clear with everyone here. We're at the largest electric reliability capital spend that we've had in our company's history, and it's actually 40% over 2020. So we're at a good pace in terms of electric reliability. But clearly, as we demonstrated in this electric rate case, there is more to do across our vast system. And so we'll be making requests in this upcoming electric rate case with, of course, better business justification to be able to support that. Clearly, when you look at our system and the amount of storms we had this year, there is room to \u2013 for improvement, and we're well aligned with this commission and this staff to do just that. Insoo Kim : Got it. Second question is just going back to the demand comments you guys made. For 2022, if I understand correctly, you're thinking more of a modest flat to modest growth and year-over-year growth. Is that correct? And then two, just you've talked about the positive signals. Is there any particular segment or industries that you're seeing that out of? Rejji Hayes : Yes, Insoo, this is Rejji. So yes, I think your working assumption for blended weather-normalized load on the electric side is about right. So call it just slightly up, flat to about 0.5 point. But again, we continue to be encouraged with what we're seeing on the residential side. So last year, we had \u2013 we assumed a pretty aggressive return to work, and we ultimately saw our residential down about 2.5%, a little over that versus 2020. Our plan was much more bearish. And so we saw a surprise to the upside versus plan there. Commercial, we've already seen commercial over the case of 2021, up about 3.3%. So effectively back at this point to pre-pandemic levels when you take energy waste reduction into account. And industrial, I'd say admittedly, it's still coming back, and that's why we feel good about 2022. And so when you think about our working assumptions for 2022, we're still assuming a decline for residential versus 2021, about somewhere between 1% to 2%. Commercial basically, flat to slightly up. And then industrial, we still expect to see pretty good growth there around 5%. So that's what, on a blended basis gets you to around a point \u2013 I'm sorry, excuse me, flat to slightly up about 0.5 point all in. And then the positive signal to new service requests, to point to a specific sector, I think, would be challenging because we're pretty diversified in our service territory. But clearly, we're seeing good news in auto. Now again, auto represents a couple of percent of our gross margins. So not a great deal of exposure there. But across most sectors, we expect to continue to see Michigan trend well. And as Garrick noted in his prepared remarks, we're seeing some very attractive economic development opportunities on the industrial side. We're not in a position right now to disclose those sectors, but we see a number of I'll say, a combination of old and new economy sectors, looking at Michigan as a place to land. And so we feel very good about the road ahead economically in Michigan. Insoo Kim : That\u2019s a good color. Thank you guys. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Michael Sullivan at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Michael Sullivan : Hey, everyone. Good morning. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Michael. Michael Sullivan : Hey, Garrick, just first wanted to ask on level of conviction and ability to potentially settle the IRP in the next couple of weeks or months here? Garrick Rochow : Yes. So I'm just going to break this down really, really clearly. I feel good about taking it a little distance. I want to make sure that's very clear. And the way I'm just \u2013 I'm sharing my thinking about this is there's $650 million of savings for our customers. That's on the table. There's a 60% reduction in carbon by 2025 over 2005 baseline levels. And there's an opportunity for more resilient supply system. Those are the factors of this. And so there's good \u2013 there's a win \u2013 I've said this before, there's a win here for everyone. And so we feel very strong about taking the full length and get what we need for our customers as well as for our investors. But bottom line, whether it's an electric case, gas case or an IRP, we're going to look at an opportunity to settle. And right now, we're in a sweet spot where there's an opportunity to do that. And when there's a win in there for everyone, there's an opportunity to a partial settlement or a full sentiment. And so we'll look at that and we'll work with the parties to see if something can materialize there. But just like there's an opportunity there, all those wins allow us to take the full distance as well. So I feel confident either way that we'll get what we need for our customers to plan it and for our shareholders. Is that helpful, Michael? Michael Sullivan : Yes, super helpful. Thank you. And my other question was, Rejji, I think you mentioned one of the main drivers for the lower than planned CapEx last year with some slippage on renewables projects. Can you just give a little more detail on that? Rejji Hayes : Yes, Michael. Good morning. Yes. So we had some renewable projects that we had to push out a little bit. I think the issues around supply chain pretty well publicized across not just the country but the planet. And so we saw some of that with respect to our projects. We still expect to get the projects executed over time, but we did have to push them out a little bit. So that was really the primary driver. And I'd say across some projects, there were some idiosyncratic issues that came up, but it was largely related to supply chain matters. Garrick Rochow : Mike, can I just jump in on this one as well. I've been involved in large power plants and operations for 25-plus years. I don't think there's been a year in those 25 where I haven't seen projects move from year to year. Major projects in terms of outages, in terms of construction time lines differed. And so it's pretty typical in our industry to have a little give and take. And so this supply chain challenge that's in front of us will dissipate over time, I have no doubt about that. But remember this, we're retiring coal. And so you have to fill that capacity somehow. So these projects aren't going away. It's just a matter of when we plant them in what year. And so again, this is pretty typical for the work we do year after year, this give and take. And so I'm not worried, not concerned, and this too will pass. Michael Sullivan : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : And our next question today comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Andrew Weisel : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question on the new CapEx plan, I see that excludes the $1 billion from the voluntary renewables program. My question is, you've been using that $1 billion number for a little while now, shouldn't that be higher given the new customers you signed up? And I understand understanding might be in kind of the later years of the plan. But should that number be a bigger one? Garrick Rochow : So the $1 billion equates to 1,000 megawatts of renewables. And so the way this works is customers have prescribed to that, and we have a certain number of subscriptions, we build out that. And so the 1,000 megawatt equates to the $1 billion. And so does that help, Andrew? Andrew Weisel : And remind me for how many megawatts are you up to sign that now? Garrick Rochow : We've got \u2013 this program started at 120 megawatts. That is fully subscribed, and we're now in the second phase of subscribing the 1,000 megawatts. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Got it. So you still got a little ways to get to that $1 billion. Okay. Great. My next question is, if I compare the old CapEx plan to the new one, it seems \u2013 I understand there's a roll forward, but it seems like your electric spending is down by about $0.5 billion and gas spending is up by about $1 billion. Is that a conscious shift in strategy? Or is that just the output of a bottoms-up budget building process? Garrick Rochow : It's really a bottoms-up piece. And just let me offer a little bit in the gas. Back in November of 2020, we got a large pipeline project approved through an Act 9, which is the equivalent of a certificate of necessity that is folded into this plan. And so as you might imagine, the replacing 56 miles of large transmission pipe, the project is around five \u2013 I think it's $550 million in that range. And so that's a big factor that as you build that bottoms-up approach, it shows up in the gas and in this vintage of capital in Apple five-year plan. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. That's helpful. Then just one last one, if I could squeeze it in. On the relative growth between the earnings and the dividend, you're targeting the high end of 6% to 8% for earnings. And I know your targeted dividend payout ratio is 60% versus about 64% in 2022. You just announced a 5.7% dividend increase. Is that a pace that we should expect for the next couple of years until you get to that 50% ratio? Rejji Hayes : Andrew, yes, this is Rejji. So yes, I think conceptually, you're right in that you're going to see a decoupling at least in the short term between the earnings growth and the dividend per share growth. And so that's what we're showing with this recent increase in the dividend because we did mention on the heels of the EnerBank sale that we'll guide down \u2013 we'll glide path down to a low 60s percent payout ratio. Right now, we're kind of mid-60s and we'll glide path down over time. So you'll see a little decoupling between the earnings growth, which will be a little bit stronger than dividend per share growth, but we still think both are healthy and combined offer very attractive total shareholder return proposition. Andrew Weisel : Definitely. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Well done. So perhaps just coming back to a couple of things. The economic development tariffs, just to come to that first here, how do you think about that impacting 2022? Just you mentioned pretty strong industrial load. Obviously, the economic development tariffs kind of impact shift those impacts and load sensitivity to earnings sensitivity. Can you talk a little bit about what that could do? I imagine it's not too material, but curious. Garrick Rochow : Yes. So let me offer a little more color on these economics. There's two pieces. We were very successful toward the end of the year and establish an economic development rate. We filed that in November. And as I said, almost record approval here with the commission and the Public Service Commission and staff, which we see as a really good indicator here in Michigan and the opportunity to encourage job growth in jobs here in Michigan. So it's an economic development rate, which is very competitive out there, and it's designed for energy-intensive customers. The next piece is we work to achieve economic set of bills that offered incentives, to make Michigan competitive. That was offered through, again, bipartisan support through the legislature signed by the Governor, that was close to $1 billion, $1.5 billion of incentives here in the state. And so GM made their big announcement, nearly $7 billion of investment in Michigan, 4,000 new jobs. That is a direct result of that work. And so we feel good by the initial valley here. But as Rejji said, there's \u2013 and I shared in my prepared remarks, there are more that are considering Michigan, and so we see a lot of upside from an industrial and jobs growth perspective and ultimately, the spillover benefits. But Rejji, I don't know if you want to add any additional context to that at all? Rejji Hayes : No, I think you laid it out well, Garrick. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. So we'll see what happens this year. Perhaps if I could pivot on Campbell, just super quick, if I can. Campbell retirement, as you've alluded to several times already, a retirement, the 2025 time frame, that's come up a lot in the IRP and represents a substantive portion of the O&M savings. I think it's order of magnitude, $60 million. Do you offset for this retirement? And again, as you think about it, if it is pushed back, for instance, in an IRP settlement? Or again, how you would think about that fitting into your plan to the extent to which that moves out, if you will? Garrick Rochow : Well, in my earlier comments, just to be really clear, $650 million of savings in total requires the retirement of Campbell one, two and three. And start of my career at that plant, you can't do a partial there. It just doesn't work. And so you need the whole thing. One, for the savings piece for our customers, but you can't do a partial retirement. So that's critically important in this equation in this IRP. The second piece is, when you retire a plant like that, you need to backfill in terms of capacity, in terms of energy. And the lowest cost option on that, we proved their modeling is to Covert and through the DIG facilities. And so again, this is why it all comes together quite nicely. And so it's very clear what's necessary to do this type of savings for our customers, to improve the supply side from a resiliency perspective and then also to have a 60% reduction in carbon. So that's how we're approaching it. Again, a lot of benefits, a lot of wins for every one, and we think we can achieve that \u2013 not that I think. We know we can achieve that here in 2022. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And just even further to clarify that, your core base plan, it doesn't reflect Campbell per se. The IRP, should we say, upside as we talked about from a capital perspective, and making that affordable is predicated on Campbell, right, just to segment that apart? Garrick Rochow : Yes. We need Campbell. We need all of Campbell to retire. And again, that's not built into our plans. Now our five-year plan at all, not the savings, not the capital upside. It's not in the plan. So just to be clear there. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent guys. I wish you a best of luck which would happen in Michigan, I am curious. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Julien. Operator : And our next question today comes from Nick Campanella of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Nick Campanella : Hey, good morning, everyone. Garrick Rochow : Good morning. Nick Campanella : Hey. So most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to go back to the electric rate case quick, absolutely acknowledge, really healthy ROE and equity ratio. The commission did seem to push back on capital costs, specifically with that one solar project, I guess, at least for this order. Can you confirm you're moving forward with that project still? How should we think about subsequent approvals in your clean energy generation capital plan? Understanding it's obviously imperative for the company's decarbonization goals, but the commission does seem to be taking a slower approach to at least your initial set of projects here. Thanks. Garrick Rochow : I don't agree with that conclusion that they're taking a slower approach. The language is really clear in the ex parte order and in electric rate case, other support for green energy. And in fact, that washing project, and it's clear that it's been supported and from a construction standpoint and a regulatory recovery standpoint. Now Rejji will walk through a little bit of the financial piece and how we'll progress with that project here over the course of 2022 and 2023. Rejji Hayes : Yes, Nick. So again, to Garrick's point, we feel very confident that it was really a deferred decision by the commission because they did approve the contract in November before electric rate order and the only reason it wasn't approved in the orders, just given the timing of which it was introduced into the case, we do expect to get a constructive outcome in a subsequent filing. And so as a result of that, to Garrick's point, we'll continue to execute on the project. And because of the high probability of approval will recognize AFUDC equity and debt accounting on this project. And so there will be no P&L drag if you will, and just a little bit of deferred cash flow or lag on the cash flow side. And so we fully expect to move forward on the project and again, expect a constructive outcome in a subsequent case. Is that helpful? Nick Campanella : Yes. That's very clear. I appreciate the time today. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold at Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : Just a quick question, again, on the five-year plan, thanks for the clarity on what's driving the step-up in the gas side that was clearer. I'm just curious, though, on the electric distribution line. It seemed to take a pretty meaningful step down in 2022. And we're sort of \u2013 I think that will explain most of the delta. Can you square that, Garrick, with your comments about customer growth and new connections and the like and maybe sort of \u2013 maybe the rate case is partly the answer but just curious. Garrick Rochow : Yes, specifically for new growth, both electric connections and we have a deferral mechanism on there. And so we can allocate the appropriate amount of capital for growth. And then see recovery in a subsequent case. And so that\u2019s \u2013 perhaps we have had at least the last couple of rate cases that allow us to \u2013 it\u2019s in three areas, both in new business at the relocations and demand capital. And so that's been very helpful in allowing us to expand our electric capital in year as a result of changes in the environment like great business growth. And so that's an important piece. The other piece that I would just, again, point back to, our electric reliability spend is robust. It's the largest we've had here across our company, 40% over 2020. But I would offer this, there's better and more important work we need to do in this next electric rate case. We have more capital that we want to invest on behalf of our customers and electric reliability to offer benefits and improve our performance there. and we'll work to engage that into the \u2013 to build that out in the next case. And I know Rejji would offer \u2013 also offer some comments as well. Rejji Hayes : Jonathan, the only thing I'd add, you noted that there was a slight dip in the front end of the five-year plan on the distribution spend. So you can see it a little off trend. We tend to and have historically been at about $1 billion per year spend rate for all the reliability work that we know needs to get done in our service territory. The dip in 2022 that's attributable to just aligning the spend plan in 2022 with the rate order. We had about around $100 million or so or thereabouts of disallowance in the rate order. And so obviously with the forward test year, we can toggle our plans accordingly. And so that's really what's driving some of that decline in 2022, which is a little off trend. Jonathan Arnold : Okay, great. That's perfect. Thanks guys. Operator : And our next question today comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Travis Miller : Good morning, thank you. Garrick Rochow : Hi, Travis. Travis Miller : Back to the IRP. Just thinking about timing post IRP, would you get a decision soon enough or have concrete plans soon enough to weave anything from the IRP into the presumed electric rate case that filing this year? Garrick Rochow : Our electric \u2013 we're going to file our electric rate case here in April timeframe. And so that's our plan right now. And so we don't anticipate \u2013 initial order could come out very earliest in April and then a final order in June. And so I don't anticipate that'll be woven into this electric rate case. Travis Miller : Okay. What is your thought on timing of maybe specific projects or capital at least generally from the IRP, a year out, six months out from the decision? What's your thought there? Garrick Rochow : Our intent here is to, so again, I don't want to presume approval. I think that would be, I don't get in front of the commission on that. But again, confidence in of a final order by June, and let's play this out Covert dig into the utility. We'd looked to update our plans, our five-year plans and the kind of the normal cycle to reflect those changes. Travis Miller : Okay. Perfect. And then real quick on the enterprise side, any update to the strategy there? Garrick Rochow : Enterprises continues to be an important part of our business, although it was really a small part of our business. And just as a reminder for everyone on the call, it's about 4% of our earnings mix. So again, small and then as big in other facilities move into the utility that enterprise group grows as even smaller. Right now, it's focused on renewables and customer relationships. And so let me offer a little bit more context around that. For example, a company like General Motors or one of the companies that Enterprise works with. They have long-term commitment to sustainability across their global footprint. And so they provide a creditworthy party and we have a long contract period. We help them find renewable assets throughout the U.S. And so that's the role we play. We see utility-like returns or better in that space. And again, we're not out in the auctions. We're not out being squeezed from a margin perspective. It's specifically designed at customer relationships and helping them meet their sustainability targets. And so it's narrow, it's thoughtful. It's a small part of our business but important for our strategic customers. Travis Miller : Great. Thanks so much. That\u2019s all I have. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning. Hopefully, just two quick ones. And I don't know if I'm reading too deep into this, but I think of the 2021 actual at 265, the range you gave for 2022 of 185 to 189. The midpoint there is not actually towards the high end of the six, it's actually above the high end and this is before any of the additional capital team that you're actually not even trending towards the high end, you're above the high end. Is this just smaller numbers and moving a decimal place here or there? Or is there more to read through to this? Garrick Rochow : Well, here's the good news, Anthony. You said 185 to 189, it's 285. Anthony Crowdell : 285. Apologies. It's a long morning. Apologies. Garrick Rochow : No problem. So again, we're happy with where we landed this year, and we've got a lot of momentum coming into the year. And for some of the reasons that Rejji articulated earlier, but you may want to jump in again on this one. But bottom line, we've offered guidance there. We feel we've expanded and raised that guidance and feel good about \u2013 really good and confident about landing there. And as I shared earlier, likely in the midpoint range, a lot of year left, but in the midpoint of that range we offer today. And so again \u2013 and then after this and really into 2022, that is the base here, we'll grow at that 6% to 8% towards the high side. Anything else to offer on that Rejji? Rejji Hayes : No, I think you have the key point, Garrick, which is the 6% to 8% guidance, Anthony, and that sort of confidence toward the high end, that is off of the 2022 base. And so I think 2023 and beyond, 2022 is a fairly atypical year. Again, given the sale of the bank, and that's why you see a little bit higher growth in the range of 285 to 289 off of the 2021 actuals of 265. It implies like 7.5% to 9%, but we don't foresee ourselves growing at that clip going forward. So it's just an atypical year as we reduce the dilution from the EnerBank sale and redeploy the capital. Anthony Crowdell : What has to happen for you guys to hit the 6%? Like why even to 6% there? It seems that you guys are really fully loaded 7% to 8%. I'm just curious what's the scenario where you come in to the 6% like why not remove it, I guess, is my question? Rejji Hayes : Well, I mean, even though the range may seem wide on a percentage basis, it's about 4% to 5% on average, Anthony. And so we think that, that's plenty conservative to give us a little room to land the plane. So we feel good about the guidance range, which, again, I think is one of the tightest in the sector. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And just last for me. I think you said gigs, the plant was \u2013 had an extended outage 2021. Just what was the issue? And is that plant back in service? Rejji Hayes : Yes. The quick answer is back in service. There was a supply line of gas that was feeding into the plant that needed some additional construction work. And having been in the gas business for a long time, we know once that type of work is done, lasts about 70 years or so. So we feel good about the fact that, that was nonrecurring and we'll be back at normal operations going forward for the foreseeable future. But just to be clear, it wasn't our gas line, it was from a third party, but that's now fixed, and we're off and running. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Paul Patterson at Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Hey, how it\u2019s going? Garrick Rochow : It\u2019s going well, Paul. Thanks. Paul Patterson : Just \u2013 and I apologize if I missed this, but the normalized storm impact for 2021 that you guys \u2013 and I guess the delta that you guys are thinking, I see that you're combining it with customer initiatives. How much was this still \u2013 what do you think about in terms of \u2013 how should we think about storms this year, I mean, in 2021 versus 2022? Rejji Hayes : Yes, Paul, thanks for the question. So we've seen at least over the last four or five years, an increase in sort of a, I'll say, the volume and the intensity of storms. And so service restoration has been somewhat volatile. Last year, I'd say, was atypical even relative to the last few years. And so I think if you look back from, say, pre-pandemic levels to 2020. We were on a spend rate of somewhere around $70 million to $80 million. And then 2021, we were a multiple on top of that, I think, almost 2x to 3x that \u2013 not 3x, but closer to 2x. And so we just don't foresee a level of service restoration at those levels in 2022. So we expect to be sort of \u2013 I think we have in rates about $65 million. So we may be a little north of that when all is said and done this year, but we certainly don't think we'll see numbers in excess of $100 million, $150 million, which is where we were last year. So that's how we're thinking about it, sort of more towards where we are in rates and maybe slightly above that. Is that helpful? Paul Patterson : Very helpful. And then just with respect to COVID, I mean it looks like you guys have done very well during it and it looks \u2013 you gave a lot of information on the usage and everything. But I'm just wondering, is it kind of \u2013 are we sort of \u2013 is COVID kind of a nonissue at this point, should we think about in terms of 2022 and going forward? I mean, obviously, you can't predict the pandemic. But I mean, I'm sort of saying, I mean, how do you think of COVID impacting stuff, I guess, in 2022? Garrick Rochow : I don't want to minimize COVID or the health effects to people. And so probably sensitive to my response here. But bottom line, what we've \u2013 in Michigan here, we're seeing all the economic indicators are headed in the right direction. And then people have figured out a way to be able to work and live and even play in the midst of a pandemic. And as a company, we found ways to work safely with the appropriate precautions in place. And so again, we're not seeing what we saw at the beginning of the pandemic, which was economic shutdowns and other factors influencing load. It's really on the upswing. And all economic indicators are, again, headed in the right direction. And so I would put it in more of a perspective that we figured out how to work within the context of COVID. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. I really appreciate it. Thanks so much Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Rocco, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today for our fourth quartile earnings call. Take care and stay safe. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. Have a wonderful day. Thank you.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 p.m. Eastern Time, running through May 10. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.  At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Srikanth Maddipati : Thank you, Austin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  This presentation contains forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. I'm pleased to share the great progress we have made over the quarter and with our IRP.  You've heard me speak about our simple investment thesis on many of these calls. It has withstood the test of time, and this quarter was no different. The industry leading at 0 commitments. These aren't just words. They are evident in our actions and our results. Our IRP settlement paves the way to be out of coal by 2025, one of the first utilities in the nation to achieve such a milestone. Our recently announced net 0 goal for our gas system, not just a dream but evident and proof point in our net 0 methane target and a 20% reduction in customer emissions by 2030.  Excellent through the CE way. I can't think of a more important time given inflation and supply chain constraints for our industry-leading cost management muscle will play out. Reggie will walk through specifics in his prepared remarks, but I continue to be confident in our ability to offset inflationary pressure and alleviate supply chain concerns. This means keeping customer bills affordable through our CE way lean operating system. Top-tier regulatory jurisdiction. The IRP settlement once again demonstrates a constructive regulatory environment in Michigan, delivering important, industry-leading outcomes for all. I'd be remiss if I didn't thank the Michigan Public Service Commission staff, Michigan Attorney General, customer groups, environmental organizations, energy trade representatives and the Consumers Energy work team for the constructive dialogue led to settlement in a 20-year blueprint to meet Michigan's energy needs while protecting the environment for future generations.  All of this, along with the fundamentals of our simple but impactful investment thesis, leads to a consistent premium total shareholder return for you, our investors. At CMS Energy, we deliver for all our stakeholders. This is why you own us and what you can count on.  Now, let me get on with sharing the great news of the IRP and our quarter. I'm thrilled with this settlement. It provides a 20-year blueprint to meet Michigan's energy needs while protecting the future -- the environment for the future generations and ensuring financial certainty. You've heard me say before, our IRP is a win for everyone, and let me share with you why. Our customers will see significant savings in addition to cleaner and more reliable energy. We're accelerating our ESG ambitions to decarbonize and lead the way to protect our planet, exiting coal operations and achieving a 60% carbon emission reduction by 2025, growing our solar bill to 8 gigawatts and accelerating 75 megawatts of battery storage between now and 2027.  Our investors will see capital upside along with the purchase of the Colbert plant and economic incentives and demand-side programs, as well as the continuation of a financial compensation mechanism, FCM, on purchase power agreement, PPAs. We also received regulatory asset treatment at an ROE of 9% on our retired coal asset through the remaining design lives.  This settlement agreement is closely aligned with our original filing, but most notably, we dropped the purchase of CMS Enterprise assets and instead will pursue long-term PPAs of 700 megawatts of Michigan-based capacity starting in 2025. While we believe the purchase of the CMS Enterprise assets was a good value for customers, our primary concern was ensuring we secured sufficient capacity to meet our customers' needs. The proposed RFP, coupled with the purchase of the Colbert plant and a delayed retirement with a Karn 3 and 4 peaking unit will address this concern.  DIG and the peakers and enterprises will have an opportunity to participate in this RFP, but we'll otherwise continue to sell capacity as they've done in the past in the attractive bilateral market. This is a win for everyone.  In March, we announced plans to achieve net 0 carbon emissions for our natural gas system by 2050, which includes both our customers' and our suppliers' emissions. This adds to our long-term plan, both electric and natural gas, to further drive decarbonization and provides meaningful proof points along the clean energy transformation. Net 0 emissions across our natural gas system is certainly an ambitious target, however, we've modeled this extensively. We believe it's achievable. The lowest cost and most reliable transition to a clean energy future is through existing infrastructure in a clean fuel network.  It also acknowledges that there are thoughtful ways to reduce and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions across important home heating and thermal electric generation resources. Both are important in ensuring long-term affordability and reliability for our customers.  As we've demonstrated across our electric system with this IRP, these aren't just words. They are evident in our actions and our results. The proof points are in both our net 0 methane target and 20% reduction in gas customer emissions by 2030, and we're delivering on those plans and investment opportunities. This includes accelerating vintage main and service replacement and adding renewable natural gas to our system, all included in our 5-year capital investment plan. It also means greater energy efficiency, carbon offsets and potential hydrogen blending, which provide growth opportunities above our plan, strengthening and lengthening our investment horizon.  Our decarbonization plan is good for our customers, our planet and our investors. This is an important road ahead. We look forward to updating you on our progress.  Like I shared at the beginning of my remarks, we've had a great quarter. We're off to a strong start of the year on all fronts. In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.20. This is up $0.11 per share from last year ahead of our plan and positions us well as we start the year, giving us confidence as we navigate the 9 months ahead. We are reaffirming our 2022 adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.89 per share, and we continue to guide to the high end of our long-term adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%. The IRP strengthens and lengthen our ability to deliver on our earnings glide path going forward. Looking forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a target payout ratio of about 60% over time.  Today, we are reaffirming our $14.3 billion 5-year customer investment plan. As we've noted, the IRP does provide upsides to our current plan, but we'll remain disciplined in our approach. You can expect to see that update as we report fourth quarter results early next year.  As I often say, strong execution leads to strong results, and this quarter was another impressive example. We are confident in the full year guidance, and we are focused on delivering for our customers, the planet and you, our investors.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we're happy to report our first quarter results for 2022. We delivered adjusted net income of $346 million or $1.20 per share, up 10% of our 2021 first quarter results, largely driven by favorable weather and economic conditions in this year. From a weather perspective, a relatively high volume of in degree days in the first quarter, coupled with the absence of unfavorable weather during the same period in 2021, provided $0.06 per share of positive variance, as noted on Slide 7.  And from an economic standpoint, we continue to see strong commercial and industrial load in our electric business, while weather-normalized residential load continues to exceed pre-pandemic. All in, weather-normalized load in the first quarter contributed $0.04 per share positive variance versus the comparable period in 2021, and is either at or above pre-pandemic levels across each of our customer segments, particularly when excluding the effects of our energy efficiency programs, which reduced customer load by about 2% per year.  Another noteworthy driver of our financial performance for the quarter was rate relief net of investment-related expenses, which contributed $0.03 per share of upside as we continue to realize the renewal effects of tax benefits from our 2020 gas rate settlement. These sources of positive variance were partially offset by increased operating and maintenance or O&M expenses and the utility in support of key customer initiatives related to state, reliability and decarbonization is equated to $0.06 per share of negative variance. We also realized $0.02 per share of negative variance for the quarter largely related to annualized financing costs and the timing of tax expenses at the parent company.  Looking ahead, we feel quite good about the remaining 9 months of the year. As always, we plan for normal weather, which we estimate will have a negative impact of about $0.09 per share versus the comparable period in 2021. We expect the impact of weather will be offset by rate relief net of investments, which we estimate to be roughly $0.20 per share versus the comparable period in 2021, and is largely driven by our expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas rate case later this year.  Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q4 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expenses at utility, driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the new way and other cost reduction initiatives and a more normalized level of service restoration expense on the fields of record storm activity in 2021. Collectively, we assume O&M cost performance will drive $0.29 per share positive variance.  Lastly, we're assuming normalized operating condition to enterprises given the extended outage mid last year, coupled with the usual conservative assumptions around revenue normalize. As we've said before, we'll continue to plan conservatively like we do every year to ensure we deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances, for the benefit of our customers and investors.  Our ability to deliver the results you expect year in and year out is supported by Michigan's strong regulatory environment. And as Garrick highlighted earlier, the multiparty settlement of our IRP provides more evidence of that. As noted, the IRP settlement that we recently filed includes a substantial near-term capital investment opportunity and the acquisition of the Colbert gas plant, which strengthens and lengthens our financial glide path to the tune of about $0.40 to $0.04 per share, with the assumption of reasonable parent funding cost and a 9% ROE on the retired coal assets.  As we look ahead, we remain acutely focused on obtaining approval of our IRP settlement agreement and making progress on our pending rate cases, which are highlighted in the regulatory calendar on Slide 8. As for the latter, just last week, we filed an electric rate case requesting a $272 million revenue increase with a 51.5% equity ratio and a 10.25% ROE. And I'll note that even with this request, the typical electric bill for residential customers will remain below national average.  From a timing perspective, we expect an order of electric rate case in the first quarter of 2023. We also continue to work through our pending gas rate case and recently filed in votes. We anticipate an order for the gas rate case by October of this year.  The question we often get when we discuss our capital investment opportunities and regulatory construct is whether we can manage our cost to minimize the rate impact for our customers. And I'm pleased to report that we remain hard at work on all aspects of our cost to preserve headroom for needed customer investments in the long term and to mitigate the challenging inflationary environment in which we live.  Turning to Slide 9, you'll see that several countermeasures have been implemented over the past several quarters to offset inflationary pressures. On the left hand side of the slide, you'll note that the table highlights across categories that have had well-publicized atypical levels of inflation, specifically cost related to labor, materials and commodities, and the corresponding risk mitigation efforts that we have employed.  Starting with labor. Our workforce is roughly 40% unionized, and in 2020, we renegotiated all 3 of our collective bargaining agreements with 5-year terms, which provides cost and labor stability over the next few years with a substantial portion of our employee base. On the non-union side, we have benefited from a strong retention rate, which is in excess of 95%, and allows us to minimize hiring in a tight labor market.  From a materials perspective, we are actively managing our supply chain to reduce rising input costs. Part of these efforts include leveraging market analysis to optimize terms and conditions with new and existing vendors where possible, while broadening our vendor base. We are also deploying the CE way in our distribution centers to eliminate waste, and we are exploring those best practices with our suppliers to reduce their costs and maintain availability of key materials.  It is also worth noting that approximately 90% of our material costs were capitalized, which reduces the income statement impact in the short term as those costs are incurred over time.  Lastly, given the well-publicized tightening of slower equipment supply, we'll remind you that our solar build-out is modular in nature and allows us to flex the projects over the plan period.  On the commodity side, we continue to run our electric generation fleet in a cost-efficient manner to insulate our customers from market volatility when they are dispatched. In fact, the heat rate of our natural gas plants were some of the lowest in the region, which means we can offer power at a cost lower than market, and that provides substantial value for our customers.  As we manage inflation risk in the current environment, you'll note on the right-hand side of the slide that we still have substantial episodic cost reduction opportunities longer term, which we estimate will generate over $200 million through coal plant retirements and the expiration of high-priced power purchase agreements. These cost savings are above and beyond what we'll aim to achieve annually with the CE way, which I'll remind you was a key driver in our achievement of over $150 million of cost savings in aggregate over the past few years.  Sustainable and agile cost management has been one of the key pillars of our success and enabled us to deliver on our financial objectives and they remain ample opportunities to reduce costs across the business going forward. Given our track record of reducing costs, we're highly confident that we'll be able to mitigate risk in the current environment, and in the long run, execute our capital plan, delivering substantial value for customers and investors, as we always have. And with that, Austin, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research. Michael Sullivan : Garrick, can you maybe just give a little more clarity on what you mean by strengthening the 6% to 8% as it relates to the IRP upside? Is there any reason that we shouldn't think of that as putting you above the 8%? Garrick Rochow : Great question, Mike. Let's start here. This is a great settlement, but there's an important regulatory process that we're still in the midst of. And just like back in 2018 and 2019, there's a few parties that can contest the settlement. That's pretty difficult. We anticipate that to occur over the next month in the regulatory proceeding. There's a schedule for that, a calendar for that, that occurs over the month of May. And then the commissioners will issue an order, which we anticipate in late June. It could drift into July, but we anticipate late June at this point.  So I do not want to be out in front of the commissioners on this and put the cart in front of the horse per se, but here's what I'll tell you on this. We feel good about the settlement and the ability because the number of parties are on, and to be able to navigate that process. So what it means from a plan perspective is, as we've shared, that strengthen and lengthen our plan and gives us great confidence in our ability to achieve the 6% to 8% towards the high end. As we shared, this is, again, upside to the plan, IRP is upside of the plan.  And here's how I'd think about it. We know and we've certainly made it clear that in 2023, Colbert comes in the plan in the May time frame. That's good from a planning perspective. But remember, this important piece in the 6% to 8%. We deliver each and every year, and then we rebase off of actuals, so that's an important piece. It's that compounding, a quarterly -- compounding it. It's the quality of earnings, which you've come to know and expect. And frankly, that allows us to do the strengthening and lengthening across the broader land. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Sorry. If I could just try a little more. I mean, are you trying to imply that there may just be one outsized growth here, and then that's where you would rebase off of the -- to see 6% to 8% continued off of that? Is that a fair way of reading that? Garrick Rochow : No, I don't -- we don't do sugar highs. There's -- We've got nearly 20 years of consistent financial performance, I mean, and we're going to deliver -- our plan here is to deliver year '20. And so again, I think there's strengthening, lengthening of that plan comes from the ability to be at 6% to 8% towards the high end. We've got great confidence in that, but also this rebasing.  Each and every year, you know our history, we deliver and then we rebase off actuals, and that provides a nice opportunity to strengthen the length of the plan. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Got it. And maybe going in a different direction, the electric rate case you just filed. Maybe if you could just walk us through conviction level and getting a bigger portion of the ask this time? Given the order late last year, and maybe some differences this time around or lessons learned? Garrick Rochow : I feel really good about this rate case that we're filing. And I'm, again, confident in this regulatory construct. There's been a number of signals here over the last quarter that gives me confidence in the regulatory construct. Let me start there. We had a rehearing on our electric rate case. That was a positive. For a small dollars, but a positive. Our gas rate case, we had SaaS position. The initial valley was constructive and a great starting spot in this IRP settlement with staff, with the Attorney General provides another data point that speaks to the constructive nature of this. We took feedback after the last electric rate case, I shared that in the last earnings call, and we rewrote a lot of our testimony, specifically in the area of electric reliability. Enhance and bolstered our business cases.  And so this is going to be a step change and is a step change in our filing. And I always share we have more work that we're working on to continuously improve that rate case process, but I feel good about our filing. It's primarily made up of electric reliability and resiliency work, important work to deliver for our customers. There's also the Colbert facility is in there. There's a little bit of work on economic development. We've seen a lot of growth here in the state to support that work and this broader clean energy transformation. And so I feel good about the case and the strength of the case and getting a good outcome. Operator : Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to go with the IRP a little bit more, and you talked about some of the earnings uplift there. And just wondering if you might be able to share, I guess, financing needs that might be possible on the back of that?  And then separately, could you walk us through the RFP that was agreed to as an alternative to the DIG acquisition? And just wondering, there's been a lot of focus on the state and potentially extending Palisades. Do you think this could be an option here? Garrick Rochow : Rejji, you will start with the financing piece, and then we can bounce back and forth on your other questions. Rejji Hayes : Yes, Jeremy. I'd say with respect to the financing needs coming out of this IRP settlement agreement, we'll be obviously focused on, assuming we get approval, the acquisition of the Colbert facility. And so that would take place around mid-2023, call it the May time frame. And so we would plan to fund that with debt at the utility. Given our rate making capital structure, you can assume about half of it is funded that way. So call it, roughly $400 million or so based on an $815 million purchase price, and then we fund the balance at the parent. And we still feel quite good about the commitment to avoid issuing equity prior to 2025, and so we would assume that the parent financing would likely include the sort of equity credit like securities that we've done in the past that our hybrids are preferred, which we have really executed at optimal levels over the last several years.  So that would be the financing plan as we sit here today, and we'll keep an eye on how market conditions evolve over that time frame. Garrick, I'll hand it to you for the RFP and the Palisades. Garrick Rochow : Yes. From an RFP perspective, what we agreed to in the settlement is 700 -- equivalent of 700 megawatts of a portion of it -- some of our megawatts of load out there, capacity out there. The 500 megawatts is dispatchable, and that's the nature of that and available, reliable generation in the state. And then 200 megawatts is in the category of renewables, again, purchase power agreements. For those purchase power agreements that are not associated with the affiliate, there's the opportunity to earn a financial compensation mechanism on those. And enterprise has the opportunity to bid in to that 700 megawatts, primarily in the 500 megawatts that are dispatchable in nature. And so that's the nature of the RFP.  In terms of Palisades, it's important to remember, we're not the owner or operator of Palisades. We've not been involved in any conversations with the Department of Energy. And if for specific questions in this call on Palisades, I'd really direct them to Entergy specific to the plant.  Now our governor has came back -- has came out in support of keeping Palisades operational. We're certainly supportive of our governor and the administration and in even a broader context, we believe in nuclear energy as part of the solution here for reliable, dispatchable and clean energy across our nation in Michigan. Our PPA on that facility expires here at the end of May. It is an expensive purchase power agreement, and as we've shared in the course of this call, we're laser-focused on reducing costs for our customers, and so that is front and center for us. We'd certainly entertain a long-term purchase power agreement, a new purchase power agreement with the facility entertaining discussions and conversation about that, but it does have to be at a competitive price. That will be an important factor. And then also, we expect to receive on of -- a stand on that new PPA as well. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful there. And maybe pivoting a bit here towards decarbonization, what investment opportunities are you seeing in support of decarbonization for the gas system? And maybe thinking about RNG a bit more, how much regulated CapEx do you think this could translate into? Garrick Rochow : Well, in our 5-year plan, there's a hefty amount. There's about $5 billion, a little more. It's aimed at decarbonization of our natural gas system. Again, it's multiple benefits. You're out there replacing old pipe, vintage pipe as we call it in services. It makes the system safer, improves reliability of natural gas system, also eliminates methane emissions, one of the leading causes of climate change. And so we've got a target of net 0 by 2030, so those investments are being made right now over the course of the 5 years and will extend into the 10-year plan as well.  We see our renewable natural gas is also part of that solution. It is part of this gas rate case that's underway right now. If you get into the details of staff's position, they were not supportive of that renewable natural gas. However, they left an opening in there, which we think we can mitigate in the course of rebuttal, and move that into the utility. There's some work to be done there in our gas case. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. . Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Bank. Andrew Weisel : First question, I want to ask a little bit more about the inflationary pressures. I appreciate all the details you gave. In the past, I think you talked about limiting bill increases to say 2% or 3%, if I remember correctly. My question, how confident are you about your ability to stick to that in, say, 2022 and maybe '23? I assume widespread inflation won't be as big of a concern after that. But in the near term, do you still feel comfortable with those past targets? Garrick Rochow : Everyone in this sector and even outside the sector, it's been inflation. To me, the bigger question is who do you think is best at managing that? And I would put us up to the top of the list. Our ability to leverage CE way and provide cost savings for our customers is certainly -- again, we talked about it as flexing our muscle here.  We got great examples of that in 2020. We saw sales drop. We find $100 million of savings in the organization. We've got in 2021, in August, we had $0.16 of impact just to storms. We offset that. We have an amazing ability to be able to leverage the tools of the CE way and then plus automation, I would add, to be able to mitigate costs. And so Rejji went through a number of examples in the way we manage that across the system.  And so long term, when we look at our 5-year plan. And even in the short term, there's a nice ability to manage rates and keep them affordable for our customers. In line with kind of traditional inflation, you might say, but I feel confident in our plan to be able to mitigate much of the impact of inflation going forward. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. Next question is at Enterprise, it's mentioned that Big and the Peakers will likely bid into the upcoming RFP. I don't expect anything too specific for obvious competitive reasons, but can you qualitatively talk about how you think of the trade-off between, say, price certainty and stability that would come with a long-term contract versus the potential for lower revenues given the competitive nature of bidding? Garrick Rochow : I think, Rejji, I'll tag team this one. Bottom line is it's something that Enterprise is going to consider. Again, I'm not certain we'll participate in that. We have potential to participate in that RFP, and we'll make that evaluation. The capacity market is certainly, as we've seen across MISO, an opportunity as well and -- for upside with our enterprise assets. And so if there's an evaluation, we'll participate in it and take a look at the impact of how Big participates either in the bilateral market or our bid into this longer-term PPA with the utility. Rejji Hayes : Yes, Andrew. The only thing I would add to that is, philosophically, we've always had the mindset that we try to run our non-utility businesses like a utility and as low a beta fashion as possible. And so if we have an opportunity to get attractive levels for energy and capacity, and we can do that over the long term, that's generally been our bias, and we've done that on the energy and capacity side at DIG for some time now. And when we own the bank, that's how we ran the bank as well. It's just trying to lock in as much revenue as possible and run it on a lower basis.  And so we'll see. I think it's a function of where the market is at the time and how long the PPAs are in the bilateral market versus what might be offered in this RFP. So we'll see what the fact pattern looks like and we'll run the business accordingly. Andrew Weisel : Okay. That makes sense. And just lastly, what's the timing of the RFP? And when you'll communicate AFD is, in fact, participating or not, Big and the Peakers? Garrick Rochow : I would anticipate, at least initially here, is that our RFP would be issued within the fiscal year 2022. Operator : Our next question is from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Insoo Kim : First question. Garrick. On the solar, you've talked about just modular in nature then kind of shift the timing and whatnot. But just holistically, I guess, whether it's the megawatts that's kind of a building transfer or the PPAs that are expected to come online, I guess, over the next couple of years that will earn the financial compensation mechanism. Just your broad level of confidence, I guess, in terms of being able to mitigate any impact from what's going on in the solar space? Garrick Rochow : I'll start with the punch line or the bottom line. No material impact to the 5-year plan, continued confidence in our 2022 guidance and then continued confidence in the longer-term plan, the 5 years and the 6% to 8% and meeting toward the high end. So that's the bottom line. Let me tell you why.  This IRP is 8 gigawatts. It's not 8 gigawatts tomorrow or even in the 5-year plan. We have 15 to 20 years to build this out. So there's considerable on flexibility to be able to construct that. And just like everyone else in the industry, the Department of Commerce and this investigation slowed things up in some of our projects. But these are megawatts that are going to get built. These are renewable projects that are going to get built because they're part of our broader IRP in nature. But again, let me try to offer some context from a size perspective.  We're building out own generation here, about 150 megawatts per year. So we're talking about 2 projects. In 2024, we go up to 250 megawatts per year. And so this annual capital spend is around $200 million to $250 million. This is manageable, easily manageable. And in fact, this is -- I've been in operations for 20 years. This is work that happens every year. There's stuff that goes in and out of the plan based on a lot of different variables, and so easily manageable from a capital perspective.  In fact, and just as a reminder, we have $3 billion to $4 billion of capital backlog in things like electric reliability, investments in our gas system. 80% of those projects are less than $200 million, so there's ability to put them into the plan and offer real value for our customers.  The other important part of this clean energy journey, as well as a reminder here, that although solar has been impacted, we're still progressing with wind in the state of Michigan and we're investing a lot in the space of our hydro facilities. We have 15 hydro facilities here. There's smart and thoughtful investments occurring there as well. And those are on progress, on target. And so I feel good about that from where we're headed from a clean energy perspective.  And the last piece that I'll also point to, and I think this is important from a capacity perspective. And I noted in my prepared remarks that Karn 3 and 4 continues to operate to 2031. Karn 3 and 4, we originally proposed retiring in 2023. So this settlement offers some additional flexibility from a capacity build perspective. And so again, we've got some flexibility to weather things and be able to meet all our customers' needs.  So again, we feel good about the capital plan, confident in our earnings guidance both in the year and in the long term. Insoo Kim : Understood. My second question on those enterprise assets that -- in the non-regulated ones like Big, given we won't be going to rate base here with the settlement. Depending on what you decide on the RFP if whether you'll purchase it or not, how do you just think about strategically these assets now going forward as part of the portfolio? Garrick Rochow : The enterprise assets are an important part of our portfolio. It's small but important, it makes about 4% of our earnings mix. And again, this goes back a little bit. We used to talk about the Ferrari in the garage and then it was a Tesla in the garage. It's probably the new electric Corvette in the garage. I don't know how you want to say it. But with capacity prices, there's some certainties of upside here in some of our -- in some of our Big and some of the Peakers.  But by and large, this business is about renewables and customer-focused renewables. And it's small in nature, and we deliver strategic solutions for our customers. Hasn't changed, but it continues to be a consistent performer for our business. Insoo Kim : Understood. It's been a while since we've heard that reference, but good to hear it again. Garrick Rochow : I want to bring that back. It's -- it's a great asset for us. Operator : Our next question is from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Great. So just one follow-up on Palisades, Garrick. Just can you remind us how many megawatts could be potentially re-PPA under the assumption the plant can remain viable here? And obviously, the government highlighted that there is a potential owner that's interested in acquiring the asset. Are you having sort of any discussions right now in recontracting, assuming can you keep the assets viable? Which timing seems a little bit tight, but just curious on if there's any dialogue? Garrick Rochow : It's roughly 800 megawatts, a little shy of 800 megawatts. I think it's around 780 megawatts for Palisades. In line with the Governor's letter, we're certainly open to conversations and discussions. We've had some conversations more just to understand the complexities of the situation to understand what's going on. But nothing that's really got to any level of seriousness on a long-term purchase power agreement. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay, got it. And then just real quick, Rejji, you're sort of thinking about financing needs. Can you just remind us on the preferred options? And do you see a potential to lean more on credit metrics, just given nearly a fully regulated business mix and potentially accretive CapEx updates in the near term? Rejji Hayes : Shar. So we have been targeting that sort of mid-teens FFO to debt for the rating agencies for some time now. And certainly, the sale of EnerBank gave us a nice uplift, at least in the case of S&P. And so while we do have some cushion to maybe be a little more aggressive on the funding strategy, we worked very hard to get to the level that we're at today. We've worked very hard to get the ratings we have today, and so our intent is not to stress those metrics.  And so we like the fact that we've got a little cushion on those metrics. And if that allows us to continue not to issue equity through 2025, we'll look to do that. And if we can extend beyond 2025, we'll look to do that, but not to the detriment of our metrics or rating.  So we still like that mid-teens area. That's where we are. We have a little cushion there, and we'll continue to plan the business that way. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research. Jonathan Arnold : A quick one on -- just Palisades, where it to be extended? I guess, whether or not that was with the PPA, how would you think about that in the context of your overall IRP plan and just case as you need? Garrick Rochow : Two pieces there that's really, really important. And it does have to be a competitive purchase power agreement, so I'll reemphasize that component of it as well. And if we were to consider that and have those -- and have those conversations, again, we would expect financial compensation mechanism on those as well.  Again, it just provides additional flexibility for us in clean energy. And so we'll be a little bit long from a capacity perspective, but there's opportunities to think about different investments and give us a little more flexibility in our -- even further flexibility in our solar build-out. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. And then just -- I had to go back a bit. I think it was early last year that you last gave a slide on [indiscernible] showing potential pre-tax earnings, step-up opportunities. So my question really is, is that prior disclosure still a bad one that we can think about? Or should we be looking for you to tell us something else at some point in the future? Or is that still a decent guide? Garrick Rochow : Yes. So Jonathan, we still feel good about the revenue opportunities at DIG, particularly now that we don't foresee it being part of the IRP. And so I'm going to go from memory, but we were somewhere around $35 million of revenue or pre-tax earnings associated with DIG and we still think that that's a pretty good base case to run. And what we're also seeing, probably unsurprisingly, is a tightening of the bilateral capacity market, which I think Garrick had accurately noted as attractive in his prepared remarks because we do continue to see it tighten and we do expect to see even more attractive capacity and energy opportunities on the contracted side at DIG.  So I'd say base case, it's good to be around that $35 million area, but there's certainly upside opportunities in the coming years if we continue to participate in that bilateral market. Jonathan Arnold : I guess I was asking more about the $90 million that you had that $35 million stepping up from. I wasn't sure if you want to -- Garrick Rochow : So, yes. So that's -- Yes. So that working assumption was if the bilateral market went to CONE, which was at the time around $7.50 per kilowatt month. And so in the event the bilateral market continues to tighten and gets to those levels, that certainly could be within the realm of possibility to see upside at that level, but we're certainly not planning for that given our nature. But yes, it could be an opportunity over time if we continue to see Zone 7 tighten. Jonathan Arnold : Great. And I -- yes, I think that's it. Operator : Our next question is from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Travis Miller : Wondering as you did your long-term reliability modeling as part of that IRP, when did reliability get to be an issue? Is that 60-plus percent range in 2040 with renewables, is that about where you start to max out on renewable ability to put into the mix? Garrick Rochow : I wouldn't put it that way. Here's the process of an integrated resource plan. We do loss of load expectations study. There's a number of other variables. We look at it from a system reliability perspective. And so it's an important mix of renewables and batteries, particularly in part of the plan, but also dispatchable generation. So you're getting things like gas, at least in our case, natural gas and part of the plan. And so all those come together.  And this plan that we submitted was more reliable than our previous IRP in terms of the -- in terms of the build-out. And then our extension of Karn 3 and 4, again, it was planned to be retired in 2023 and extending that to 2031, continues to provide additional reliability over the course of this decade. Travis Miller : Okay. Got it. And then kind of similar on that, could we expect some of that upside in the distribution and transmission bucket as opposed to maybe more on the generation side? The upside CapEx that you were talking about? Garrick Rochow : Well, broader, we have -- again, I look at the our 10-year, 15, 20 years, there's ample capital upside. And we have about $3 billion to $4 billion of capital that's not in the plan that are specific projects identified that improve our gas system, more replacement of mains that looks at reliability and resiliency. We've got a large $5.5 billion focus on that. I mean, much of that is in this electric rate case to improve reliability for our customers. Those are the things that fit into that plan and continue to have that long horizon of capital investment opportunities. Travis Miller : Okay. And then one just real quick. With the IRP change, your general kind of every year type of cadence on the regulatory filings, either electric or gas? Garrick Rochow : The IRP won't have any impact on our rate case proceedings. So we'll continue to stay -- the main plan is just to go with annual rate cases. But on occasion, we do stay out for a year, and we have. Our gas case is a great example that we've been out for 2 years and are in for a case right now. Travis Miller : Okay. Great. Operator : Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore. Durgesh Chopra : Just one for me. Maybe can you just, at a high level, elaborate how the financial compensation mechanisms work? And then as we're thinking about our models, how should we be modeling upside in terms of timing? Is there sort of gradual pickup in earnings as you sort of go through the RFPs? Or how does that work? Any color is appreciated. Rejji Hayes : Durgesh, this is Rejji. So the financial compensated -- financial compensation mechanism, it applied to PPAs. And we can have the team go through the math with you off-line, but in essence, you're applying what is the equivalent of our after-tax WACC as it stood in the 2018 IRP at just over 5.6%. And you're going to apply that to the megawatts of PPAs you're taking on as part of the IRP. And then the first IRP in 2018 was 550 megawatts or thereabouts, and so you would apply it to that. You also obviously take into account the hours per year, the energy cost as well as just capacity factor of the resource. And so you put all that through the vegematic. And for that first tranche of the IRP, we assume that was about $4 million of pre-tax earnings.  And so per that math, you would apply that to what we will PPA in this next IRP. And so we've said it's a 700 megawatt RFP that will roll out, assuming we get approval in the latter portion of this year, as Garrick noted. And there'll be 2 tranches, 500 megawatts dispatchable, 200 megawatts of other, and we'll have an FCM-applied to those PPAs once those are resolved. Is that helpful? Durgesh Chopra : Very helpful. And then in terms of timing, you mentioned later this year. So these are basically -- these are earnings uplifts next year. Is that the right way to think about it? Garrick Rochow : Yes. Let me be clear, the RFP for that 700-megawatt tranche of PPA, and again, it's going to be 2 tranches, 1500 megawatts of dispatchable local and 200 megawatts of other. The RFP would commence this year, but we would not effectuate the PPAs until the 2025 time frame. And so you wouldn't see any of the earnings associated with those financial compensation mechanism until that time frame.  I also want to be very clear that in the event Enterprises participates in that 500-megawatt tranche, then they would not be eligible for the FCM or we would not be eligible for the FCM. Durgesh Chopra : That is very helpful. I'll follow up with the IR team with some more details, but this is extremely helpful. Operator : Next question is from Gregg Orrill of UBS. Gregg Orrill : Yes. Maybe a clarification. This might bring up an old discussion, but what is the design life on Campbell units where you earn -- you would earn the 9% ROE under the IRP settlement? Rejji Hayes : Yes, Gregg. So of the 3 units, 2 of the units, design life runs until 2031. That's for Campbell 1 and 2. And then for Campbell 3, it's through 2039, and so that's where we'd earn that 9% on the regulatory asset after the retirement date. Operator : Next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So just coming back to the earlier conversation on the $0.03 to $0.04 of upside here from the IRP, can we go back to that math and just rehash it to start from the gross number and net that down? And specifically, what I was trying to reconcile is how do we think about the acquisition here, sort of the gross $800 million, and then reconcile that down to $0.03 to $0.04 ultimately? It seems just a little conservative, shall we say, relative to what I would otherwise expect. And maybe we could be a little bit more explicit, again, understanding some of the nuances on financing to try to reconcile that? Rejji Hayes : Yes, Julien, this is Rejji. For the $0.03 to $0.04, we're assuming it's an $815 million purchase price is codified in the settlement agreement. And so given our rate construct, you can assume, again, with our ratemaking capital structure, you're going to get 40% of that as equity. And you have to net of, obviously, parent funding costs, and we've made the usual conservative assumptions around that. And so that's where you get a good portion of the accretion I noted.  But then you also have to net out, I'd say, the downward revision in the ROE on the regulatory assets. And so remember, the IRP was not incorporated into our 5-year plan. And so we were assuming we're going to earn 9.9% on those coal facilities through their design life. And so when the settlement agreement is structured, that's going to step down to 9%. So you get a little bit of dilution there plus dilution from the parent financing, and so that's what gets you to sort of $0.03 to $0.04.  It's also worth noting, again, clearly, we are not presupposing any outcome on the PPA, that 700-megawatt tranche, so that's not included in the math. And so we're applying the usual conservatism, but that's where the math takes us, about $0.03 to $0.04. In 2023, if all comes to fruition, obviously, you have a partial year. So you wouldn't get -- you'd only get about 6, 7 months of that if we close the transaction in May as anticipated, and then you get annualized about $0.03 to $0.04. Is that helpful? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Absolutely. I appreciate it. I very much appreciate that. I -- actually, since you bring it up here, just to keep going along that logical thought process. How do you think about that 700 gigawatt PPA? I mean, in terms of ownership opportunities, you seem to be, in part, downplaying the big element of this in terms of committing to bid that -- into that procurement process. I mean, what other avenues or shots on goal, if you want to call it, do you have for an ownership opportunity there as you think about the array of different approaches you could take? Garrick Rochow : Well, yes, to be very clear, it's certainly an opportunity for DIG, particularly or specifically for that 500-megawatt tranche, which is essentially going to be earmarked for local stackable -- a local dispatchable resource. And so certainly, DIG would qualify for that, and so that is certainly an opportunity.  And as we think about the alternatives as fiduciaries, they could certainly participate in that or DIG could participate in that. And a 10-year PPA, if DIG prevails, that's not an -- that's a pretty attractive alternative depending on where the economics end up. But as I mentioned earlier, we're also seeing a very attractive bilateral market shaping up here in Zone 7, just with continued tightening. And so we are seeing levels that are in excess from our existing capacity contracts and energy contracts, and so we'll weigh the alternatives once the RFP comes around and see what we'll do there.  On the 200 megawatts, obviously, DIG wouldn't be eligible for that. But we'll see what else comes around, and we'll get an FCM on that. And so we're not presupposing any of those economics in the EPS I noted in my prepared remarks, but it certainly creates an opportunity for DIG without a doubt. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, indeed. All right. Best of luck. Operator : Our next question is from Nicholas Campanella of Credit Suisse. Nicholas Campanella : Congrats on the IRP. I just wanted to -- sorry to belabor the point on the renewable supply chain stuff. But I just -- just the bottom line takeaway is that you have, I think, roughly $700 million of clean, call it, clean generation spend in '22 and then $600 million in '23. That's all unchanged. Is that correct? Garrick Rochow : I think the important part of that clean energy spend in those 2 years you referenced is it's not all solar. There's a good portion of hydro and wind in there, and so again, we're talking about into $200 million, $250 million that would be on an annual basis that would be in the solar area. So it's -- that's the difference. Is that helpful? Nicholas Campanella : Great. Yes, that's very helpful. And then just -- I know in the fourth quarter, we talked a lot about Colbert, so I figured we can talk about some other upside opportunities. In the fourth quarter, we talked about the VGP potential gas and electric capital upside. I know they weren't in the deck today, but maybe can you just kind of talk about where you are in potentially bringing those opportunities into the 5-year plan? Is that more of an EEI fourth quarter item? And I know we're focused on the IRP in the near term, but just what about all the other upside opportunities that are outside the plan today? Garrick Rochow : That's great. Again, we'll take a look at this 5-year plan. We're building it out right now, and we'll share it here in Q4. Obviously, Colbert is a big piece of it. Those other areas within the IRP as well. We accelerated 75 megawatts of battery storage into the years of 2024 and 2027, so that has to be incorporated in as new capital upside in that 5-year plan. Extension of Karn 3 and 4 has some impact as well. So those are all additions and things that need to be worked through from a capital plan.  In terms of the voluntary green pricing, that also continues to progress nicely with our customers as they subscribe. We build out that plan. We've issued an RFP for that work. I haven't seen the results of that yet. It's still out there, but that would be a -- potentially solar could be other renewables build in the 2024 to 2027 time line. So that's -- upside is, again, we plan conservatively, is materializing, so we're not ready to announce that yet. But directionally, it looks good. Is that helpful? Nicholas Campanella : Yes. Congrats again on the IRP. Operator : Next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : Congratulations on the IRP settlement. And most of the questions have been answered here, but just with respect to sales and what have you. Is COVID over, do you think? I mean, are we now sort of the normal level of what you think will be normal going forward? Or -- I don't know. Just hoping maybe it is. Garrick Rochow : We're all hoping it is over, too. Rejji, walk through sales piece a little bit, and then I'll talk more on some macro factors. So maybe just touch on sales, Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Yes. So Paul, to be clear, I won't give you a medical assessment because clearly, the pandemic is still with us. I know that's not the spirit of the question, but I figured I'd be remiss if I didn't say that.  But from, I'd say, a retail sales perspective, we continue to be encouraged with what we're seeing virtually across all the customer classes, as I noted in my prepared remarks. And so whether it's commercial, we're up 3% above pre-pandemic levels. So looking at sort of Q1 2022 versus Q1 2019, residential is up versus the 2019 pre-pandemic level, so we're still seeing that nice mix that we've enjoyed for the last couple of years. And so Residential is starting to come back to a good deal, but still hanging in there and again, in excess of the pre-pandemic levels.  And then on a total retail sales basis, we are now about 1% above the pre-pandemic levels, and industrial is about flat, excluding one large low-margin customer.  So I would say, again, per my prepared remarks, I think at this point, we are effectively at or better than pre-pandemic levels across most of our customer classes. And so we feel good about the economic conditions in Michigan, and we continue to see very attractive leading indicators. And I think it's also worth noting that of the percentages I just shared with you, that does not take into account the energy waste reduction programs we have that reduced our load year-over-year by 1.5% to 2%. So when you exclude that, that performance looks even better.  So we feel very good on the retail sales side, but again, obviously, the pandemic still with us. But Garrick, if you have any other comments. Garrick Rochow : Yes, so just some quick macro factors. So Bloomberg recognized Michigan is the number one economy -- the state economy coming out post-pandemic, and so that's certainly a highlight. They've been recognized as the top state for foreign direct investment, over 14 -- really approaching 15,000 different firms that are located here in Michigan, 5,000 different locations. The big announcement with General Motors, but it's not just General Motors, there's a host of other things from manufacturing to agriculture and then agricultural processing that have grown here in the state.  So I feel good by the broader economic trends that we're seeing here in Michigan as well. Paul. Paul Patterson : Okay. Great. And just -- the other final thing is that there was some legislation that was -- recently introduced regarding outages and reliability. It seems to me that maybe it was more of a Detroit thing that might be driving -- I wasn't really completely clear. I was just wondering, do you have any color about -- you don't see this very often about what might be driving that legislative? I mean, it seems like it's some Democrat representatives or whatever that are proposing it. And I'm just wondering if you had any thoughts about that? Garrick Rochow : Our electric rate case and our plan underway certainly looks at improving electric liability across the state to improve value for our customers. And so that's well underway. This legislation that was introduced, we don't anticipate getting any traction without a committee. That's the short of it. Operator : Our final question is from Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Garrick, Rejji. Hopefully, an easy one. Where is Rocco? It's the first call I've been on without Rocco. Just hopefully, two easy ones. I guess following up on Mike's earlier question. I think the question is going around maybe moving above the 6% to 8% EPS growth rate. I think, Garrick, you responded with CMS doesn't do sugar highs, I guess. If I think about it, is there any desire of the company maybe to get back to that previous earnings trajectory that you had before the EnerBank sale? Garrick Rochow : Well, let me say. The first question is Rocco's great. Austin is really performing well during those calls as well. Shout out to Austin. But bottom line, from the earnings guide path we had with EnerBank, we see a clear path to do so. And I would suggest that we're on that path for all the reasons I stated earlier in regards to my response to Mike. And so I feel good about where we're heading, and confident here in that growth rate in the future. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then last question, then I'll let you guys get back to doing some work there. I guess since the IRP filing, it appears we've moved from an energy transition theme to maybe energy security theme. Have the state regulators given any messaging on energy security that would benefit your CapEx plan? Garrick Rochow : I would argue that we're focused on both. Again, we can't sacrifice one for the other, and so this IRP that's settled here does both. It allows us for that clean energy transformation as well as ensuring reliability and security of the state. And so again, there's always some policymakers and legislators that are looking at that, and we're going to continue to look at opportunities from a capital investment perspective. But again, we feel really good about our 5-year plan to balance both reliability security of the grid as well as planet. And I would add to it, our customers and ensuring that it's affordable. And Rejji, why don't you add something as well? Rejji Hayes : Anthony, the only thing I would add just to get into some of the specifics of the IRP from a capacity perspective, and to Garrick comment, this is why we feel quite good about energy security and reliability, however you want to refer to it, is that the Colbert facility is going to bring over 1.1 gigawatts of capacity. Again, assuming the settlement agreement is approved. We're also going to RFP shortly after approval. If all goes according to plan, the 700-megawatt tranche of PPA opportunity by 2025, and so that offers additional capacity. And again, 500 megawatts of that will be local dispatchable capacity.  We're also extending the retirement or delaying the retirement of Karn 3 and 4, which also provides over a gigawatt of capacity. And so again, we're taking, obviously, affordability into account. We're taking reliability into account and we're taking, obviously, the clean aspects of our plan into account, and that's what we feel good about. Not just the economics for all stakeholders, but most importantly, reliability. Anthony Crowdell : Looking forward to seeing you guys in Miami. Garrick Rochow : Same Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks. Garrick Rochow : Well, thank you, Austin. Nice job for our first time with Austin. And I'd like to thank all our callers and investors for joining us today. Take care and stay safe. Operator : That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at the time. [Operator Instructions] Just as a reminder there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 PM Eastern Time running through August 4th. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Sri Maddipati : Thank you Elliot. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thanks Sri and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'm excited to share another strong quarter at CMS Energy and a great first half of the year bolstered by favorable weather and higher weather normalized sales at the utility, great tailwinds. And over the course of the quarter two outstanding regulatory outcomes, which provide further evidence of the top-tier regulatory jurisdiction in Michigan and give us continued confidence in our plan. First our integrated resource plan. If I could open this up for just a moment, 18 months of sophisticated supply modeling, thousands of pages of testimony, 10-month schedule, alignment across dozens of stakeholders from interveners, the attorney, general business stakeholders and the commission staff to reach a settlement with close to 20 parties. This plan approved at the end of June, solidly positions us to lead the clean energy transformation. Outstanding. Next our gas rate case. Important investments to ensure a safe, reliable, affordable and clean natural gas system, settled with many of the same parties and approved on July 7th, a $170 million increase. Over 95% of our customer investment approved. Excellent. Both outcomes demonstrate the quality of our regulatory environment in Michigan increase our confidence in delivering the rest of the year and our long-term plan. I want to emphasize why we continue to be confident in our plan. Delivering is not new for us. We have nearly two decades of commitments made and kept for all our stakeholders including you our investors. A key element in our performance is strong energy law in Michigan. We have a productive and solid energy law passed in 2008, which was enhanced and updated in 2016 both with bipartisan support. This allows for timely recovery of investment, which we've outlined through long-term plans such as our IRP, as well as our electric and natural gas distribution plans, which we filed in our rate cases. This coupled with separate mechanisms allow us timely recovery of fuel and power supply costs, as well as attractive economics on renewable energy investments and energy waste reduction programs and uniquely positioned Michigan as one of the safest places to invest capital. But let me be clear, we don't take this for granted. We continue to improve our processes for stakeholder alignment, testimony development and business cases so we are confident that our proposed customer investments deliver measurable benefit while keeping this affordable. At CMS we deliver, our productive and supportive environment and our deliberate approach ensures that will matter the condition. We are positioned to deliver industry-leading results. We remain committed to leading the clean energy transformation. On the solid foundation of strong energy law, we delivered and settled our IRP. This makes us one of the first utilities in the country to completely exit coal. As of the end of second quarter, we have nearly eliminated our long-term economic exposure to coal which is now less than 2% of property, plant and equipment. Not only have we reduced our long-term financial risk, but we've significantly mitigated our operational risk as well. The acquisition of simpler, more flexible natural gas units means fewer people to operate a better heat rate and less maintenance. The ability to quickly ramp up and down the dispatch of these units will allow us to flex with changing market conditions and to better support the intermittent nature of renewables. The acquisition of Covert combined with the RFP for 700 megawatts of capacity through PPAs the build-out of 8 gigawatts of solar in our ongoing energy efficiency and demand response programs ensure that we have sufficient capacity to meet the needs of our customers. This plan improves reliability and limits our customers' exposure to potentially volatile, capacity and energy prices. The IRP strengthens and lengthens our financial plan, eliminates our exposure to coal, improves reliability and is a solid win for everyone. Strong execution and constructive regulatory outcomes lead to strong financial results, and I couldn't be more pleased with the first half of 2022. As I stated in my opening remarks, a strong quarter and a great first half of the year, where we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 for the quarter. We remain confident in delivering full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.85 to $2.89, and we continue to guide for the high end of our long-term adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which as I noted is strengthened and lengthened by our IRP. We continue to guide toward long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time and we'll update our current $14.3 billion five-year customer investment plan on our year-end call to include the anticipated upside from the approval of our IRP. We are strongly positioned to deliver in the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji, who'll offer additional detail. Rejji Hayes : Thank you Garrick, and good morning everyone. As Garrick noted, we had a strong first half of the year are ahead of plan and are well positioned to achieve our financial objectives over the next six months and longer-term. To elaborate for the first half of 2022, we delivered adjusted net income of $499 million, or $1.73 per share, up $0.09 per share versus our 2021 first half results largely driven by favorable weather and economic conditions in the state. The waterfall chart on Slide 7 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2021. As noted, favorable sales have been the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.16 per share driven by weather. From an economic standpoint, we've continued to see strong commercial and industrial load in our electric business, while weather-normalized residential load continues to exceed our plan assumptions and pre-pandemic levels. Rate relief net of investment-related expenses contributed $0.03 per share of upside, as we continue to benefit from our prior gas and electric rate cases. These sources of upside were partially offset by increased operating and maintenance or O&M expenses largely driven by customer initiatives, embedded in rates to improve safety, reliability and our rate of decarbonization, which equated to $0.07 per share of negative variance versus the first half of 2021. We also note the $0.03 per share of negative variance in the final year-to-date bucket, which is primarily driven by investment costs related to the 2019 rate compressor station incident for which we are not seeking recovery at this time, as per our recent gas rate case settlement agreement, and the company's recent commitment to donate $5 million in support of income based bill assistance for our electric customers as per our IRP settlement agreement. These sources of negative variances are partially offset by the aforementioned strong non-weather sales performance in the first half of the year. As we look to the second half 2022, we feel quite good about the glide path to achieve our EPS guidance range. As Garrick mentioned, we had a constructive outcome in our gas rate case. The approved settlement agreement at $170 million significantly de-risked our financial plan, and when coupled with our December 2021 electric rate order provides $0.10 per share positive variance versus the second half of 2021. The forecasted rate relief net of investment-related costs in the second half of the year more than offsets our estimated impact of normal weather, which we assume will provide $0.01 per share a negative variance versus the comparable period in 2021. Moving on to cost savings. We continue to anticipate lower O&M expenses of the utility driven by the expectation of a more normalized level of storm activity this year versus the atypical levels experienced in 2021, which I'll remind you equated to $0.16 per share of downside in the third quarter of 2021 versus our financial plan. We also expect the usual solid cost performance driven by the CE Way as well as other cost reduction initiatives in motion. To close out our assumptions for the second half of the year, we assume normal operating conditions at enterprises given the outage at DIG in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the usual conservative assumptions for weather-normalized load at utility. Lastly, it's worth noting that we have accrued a healthy level of contingency given our strong year-to-date performance as illustrated in the $0.24 to $0.28 of negative variance highlighted and the penultimate bar of the chart, which increases our confidence in delivering for you our investors. Moving on to the balance sheet. On slide 8, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from all three rating agencies. As you know we continue to target mid-teens FFO to debt over our planning period. As always, we remain focused on maintaining our strong financial position, which coupled with the supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating capital growth supports our solid investment-grade ratings to the benefit of customers and investors. Turning to our 2022 plan financings on slide 9, we continue to plan for $800 million of debt issuances at the utility. And while our plan does not call for any financing at the parent this year we are currently assessing funding options for the acquisition of the Covert natural gas facility in the first half of 2023 as per our approved IRP. As a reminder, the current financing plan for Covert assumes the issuance of hybrid securities. However, we're evaluating alternatives including using our existing ATM equity issuance program given the relative costs in the current environment. It's worth noting that this would be accretive to the previously provided $0.03 or $0.04 per share of EPS accretion attributable to the purchase of Covert and further strengthened our 6% to 8% long-term adjusted EPS growth outlook. Lastly, we have preserved a strong liquidity position, which supplements our use of commercial paper over the coming months. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before Q&A. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Rejji. I'll leave you with this. Nearly two decades of industry-leading financial performance for you -- our investors regardless of conditions, administrations, political parties, economic environments even a pandemic, we deliver. Our strong legislative and regulatory construct, a robust capital runway, industry-leading cost management, conservative planning and our commitment to deliver across the triple bottom-line all of this makes for a strong investment thesis and makes us an investment you can count on. With that, Elliot please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you very much, Garrick. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Garrick Rochow : Hey, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Good morning. Garrick pretty clear-cut print here. But just given sort of the regulatory outcomes that are now secured like the IRP, the gas settlements, looks like the electric rate case is on track. As we're kind of thinking about maybe the cadence of updates is the plan to still update CapEx and financing in the fourth quarter? I guess just given the visibility we have why not provide a full guidance and capital update sometime in the third quarter or EEI time frame? I guess in other words given the regulatory execution that you've clearly highlighted today, could you provide early indication on growth 2023 numbers out of schedule? Garrick Rochow : Well first of all Shar thanks for the compliments. We are executing well and I'm pleased with the first half of the year. But we're still on plan for our Q4 call for our capital update. And let me offer a little color and context around that. Big reason for our execution and our ability to deliver year-after-year is one of the things we worked through with that capital plan. And that's from the bottom up. We're looking at every one of those capital investments to make sure it's going to offer the affordability and benefits to our customers. And so they'll stack on one another. We want to make sure that we're also able to execute on those. So that's a matter of understanding our workforce, the work lined up in a year and so that we're sure that we can deliver on that capital plan. And then you add that IRP yes, there's Covert, which is great visibility. But one of the other portions of that settlement was bringing in storage, battery storage 75 megawatts in the period of 2024 to 2027. So we've got to make sure that that's constructed and built into this five-year plan as well as \u2013 we've spoken in the past about Voluntary Green Pricing programs is additional renewables for some of our largest customers. And so that's materializing as well. And so that's another factor that's going in that plan. So we want to make sure that we can deliver on it. That leads to the success of our execution. And so that's why we're going to be putting out in Q4 \u2013 our Q4 call. Shar Pourreza : Okay got it. And then just obviously, looking at the results year-to-date how 2022 is shaping up, July looks like a strong weather month. And obviously, you guys are \u2013 as you highlighted, you have normal weather planned for the remainder of the year. Does a strong third quarter weather push you ahead of guidance? And maybe what are sort of some of the offsets and moving pieces there that we should be thinking about because just looking at the results to date, it seems like you're well ahead of your numbers but... Garrick Rochow : Again, Shar we feel good about where we're at here at the first half of the year. But as you know, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we plan conservatively. Here's what I know in 2021, during the third quarter we lost $0.16 due to storms. We still delivered on 2021, but again, there's a lot of year left. And so we're prudent as we move forward. The other thing we look at is where are the opportunities to reinvest, provide benefit for our customers and investors as we move toward the end of the year. That helps to de-risk future years and again continues to strengthen and lengthen that long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8% toward the high end. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Terrific. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Thanks for the details. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, god morning. Just wanted to pick up a little bit I guess with the strong results here and it did seem like load performance was just better than expected. I'm wondering if you could provide a bit more commentary on that? And I guess do you see any of that abating or just kind of things in general from a load even absent weather a load growth perspective is going to continue at this pace, or do you see something stopping? Rejji Hayes : Hey, good morning, Jeremy, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question. Obviously, we feel quite good about the load trends we're seeing in our service territory and I'll just remind folks on some of the specifics. And so we had residential down a little over 0.5%. So that's year-to-date versus year-to-date 2021 commercial and industrial. And as always our industrial excludes one large low-margin customer, up about 3% and then all in up about 1.5 points. And so we feel quite good about that. And particularly with respect to residential, we continue to see that good stickiness with the hybrid workforce, which likely will be a trend that continues on. And obviously that's a high-margin segment. And so relative to 2019 residential is up about a little over 2%. And so again that stickiness just really carries on. We continue to see from an economic development perspective, just good activity in the service territory. And obviously, with some of the news in D.C. yesterday, I would think that the CHIPS Act and some of the other legislative items that may be coming down the pipe could lead to more economic development opportunities or increase the probability of some of the stuff that is coming in Michigan's way or is in the prospects for Michigan. So very encouraged with the load trends and anecdotal again, we're hearing from our customers that they continue to feel good about the economic environment. So I feel quite good about the road ahead. And going forward again we continue to anticipate that you'll start to head back to those pre-pandemic levels. And so we would anticipate that from a residential perspective, but we continue to be surprised to the upside and commercial and industrial continue to trend very well. So that's our take on load at the moment. Garrick Rochow : And if I could just add, just a macro factor here and this is from the Governor's office. This year-to-date, $11.8 billion of investment opportunities announced in Michigan. Those are projects that have agreed to locate expand. There's actually 30 companies in all and 15,000 new jobs. And so that's from the governor's office here mid-July. And so still looks very robust here in Michigan we looked at from a macro perspective. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful there. And then I just wanted to pivot a bit towards MISO. We've seen some capacity constraints there and that's led to some delays in equivalent retirements. Just wondering should we be thinking about any implications to CMS here or anything else that you want to share on this front? Garrick Rochow : I love our energy law. I really do. I'm not joking there. The 2016 energy law was here in Michigan was solid on the supply and demand side. And so when we go through an integrated resource plan, we've got to do all the modeling all the analysis to show that the supply and demand is going to meet and have some reserve margin on that. That's a requirement of a load-serving entity which we are. So I feel good about where Michigan is headed within MISO. And I can't speak for all of MISO, but I feel good about where Michigan is at. And I'll remind people -- remind all the people on this call that part of this IRP is to bring Covert in. Covert right now is in the PJM market and we're moving it over to the MISO market. That's 1.2 gigawatts of additional supply that's being brought into MISO and brought here to serve our customers. And so that's why we feel good about it. Our IRP we're still on pace and plan for retirement of all coal to be out of coal by 2025. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. Last one if I could hot off the press climate BBB package. Climate package being supported by management here. Any preliminary thoughts at this point? Garrick Rochow : Jeremy, you've given like what 12 hours to digest it all. Here's what I would say -- here's what I would say on it, because we've done some preliminary review and we're still digesting a lot of facts on it. Solar PTC is a big win in there and that's something we've been advocating for in Washington. We've been advocating the industry. Hats off to Rejji. Rejji has been making the calls with CFOs 1.5 years ago when it was first being talked about. And so we're excited about that portion of it what that means for 8 gigawatts. So it's going to be lower cost for our customers, as we build out more solar and it will provide -- put us on par with developers. So we like that. We know there's a storage ITC as well that will come into play in 2024 to 2027 as we build out 75 megawatts of storage. There's a lot of upside for the industry one of the birthplace of the automobile. I talked about the $11.8 billion. Most of that is in the automotive space. There's opportunities for load growth in the automotive business to grow as they make their transition. There's incentives in there for solar production in the US. In Michigan, one of our largest customers is the largest -- one of the world's largest producers of polysilicon crystals which go into solar panels and technology electronics. And so that's another -- and we see that as an upside. There's a big tailwind on EVs. EVs are a nice part of load growth. It's not in our forecast, but there's the continuing credits for purchase of EVs. And so there's a lot of good stuff in here. We're still digesting all the specifics but feeling good. Feeling good with coming out of the Senate. And of course, there's negotiations with the house in front of us. Jeremy Tonet : Great. That\u2019s helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Sullivan : Hey, everyone. Good morning. Garrick Rochow : Hello, Michael. Michael Sullivan : Hey, Garrick. Rejji, I wanted to go over to you on just the latest commentary on the potential looking at common equity for financing Covert. I think that was an $815 million project. Any sense of how much the equity could be and how materially the $0.03 to $0.04 accretion could change? Rejji Hayes : Yeah. I appreciate the question, Michael. I would say, we're obviously still evaluating options. You have the purchase price of Covert spot on at $815 million. And so as you know, our rate construct we would fund about half of that debt at the utilities to call it roughly $400 million, and the balance would be parent financing. And mathematically, that gets you to about $400 million, but we'll still consider what the alternatives might be. And obviously, we've got quite a bit of time to fund it. And so we'll look at our dribbling our ATM equity issuance program, whether that will be the full $400 million remains to be seen. And so we'll see how the price of other alternatives like those hybrid securities which for the past six to seven months or so have really priced quite competitively. And so if that changes over time, we may tranche it a little bit. And so I'd say, it's still early days, but we could go up to about $400 million. We've got that much on the shelf but we'll see how the pricing trends over the next handful of months. And then with respect to the accretion at this point, I'd say, it's a little premature to offer precisely how accretive it would be to the $0.03 to $0.04 that we initially provided because clearly that would depend on the price at which we issue equity, if we do choose to dribble. And so I'd say, more variables at this point to provide any prescriptive point of view, but it would be directionally accretive to based on the relative cost right now of our equity versus other securities. Michael Sullivan : Okay super helpful color. And then last question, what do you guys think about making it three for three with settlements this year with the pending Electric case? Rejji Hayes : We'll, see. I mean I think betting at 670 still gets you into Cooperstown. So we've been encouraged with the IRP and the gas rate settlement, electric obviously, many more stakeholders many more variables. And we've been successful there before. So we're cautiously optimistic but early days, and we'll look and see where the staff is in about a month and we'll go from there. But I would say, early days to make any prediction at this point. Michael Sullivan : Great. Thanks a lot. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning. You guys really do execute. Always, always, so let me follow-up on this legislative angle, just one nuance here. AMT is just going to get a lot of attention to speak I imagine for all the utilities here. What are you guys saying on that? I know, we asked you for your hot takes a second ago, but just can rehash as best you understood your probably assessment of this last year if you will? Rejji Hayes : Yeah. So Julien just to be clear you're talking about the alternative minimum tax with respect to last night's \u2013 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes exactly. The 15%. Rejji Hayes : Okay. Yeah, with respect to climate bill. So, again as Garrick noted we're still digesting. I think it's about 700 pages, and our folks in federal affairs and on the tax side are really, really good at what they do and their fast readers, but 700 pages is a lot to digest in 12 hours. But I'd say, basically, what we've done so far as I understand it the structure that's contemplated is consistent with what we were talking about around EEI several months ago, where there's a three-year average on pre-tax operating income around $1 billion. And if you're below that threshold, you're not subject to the minimum tax. And so from our perspective given our size we would likely not chin that bar for some time. Now needless to say, we aspire to at some point because we're a growing company. But in the short term, I think, we'd be perhaps not subject to it initially. And we're still looking at -- again, if it's structured how it was when we were talking about this at EEI, you could apply tax credits through up to 75% of the tax liability. And again, we're still looking to see whether that's in the bill but that's how it was structured initially. And so I'd say, there's a bit more work to be done on our side before we can speak to it. But I'd say, to cut through it in the short term we don't think there's a significant impact on us again given our size. And if they apply that three-year average of $1 billion of pre-tax operating income we just wouldn't chin that bar for a little while. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah, no that makes sense. Thank you for the hot takes there. Appreciate it. OPEB contribution to the quarter here, et cetera. Just curious, if you can comment here. Obviously, that subject has got some attention late broadly. Rejji Hayes : Yeah. From a pension perspective, again, our story has been quite good for some time now. As you may recall, we have been very active in making discretionary contributions to our pension plan over the year particularly in years in which we were pretty flush from an OCF perspective. And so we're well overfunded. At this point, we're -- we have two pension plans and both are over 120% funded. Clearly asset experience is tough for most, but we have relatively low equity content in our pension plans. And I would say based on how our pension is structured at this point we're a bit more levered to interest rate movement. And with discount rates effectively going up year-over-year, we actually see it in the short term as a net benefit. And so we actually are seeing actually, a little bit of upside particularly since we recently remeasured our plan. So from our perspective, it's actually net positive at the moment and we feel quite good about the level of funding for the plan. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Totally. All right. So no material OPEB impact here in the quarter? Rejji Hayes : No. No. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks a lot. And then last one just a quick clarification from earlier on Solar TTC [ph] I mean clearly, benefits customers from an NPV perspective, but also I think implicitly also helps utilities participate from a rate base perspective as well, I take it? Rejji Hayes : Yes. So obviously, our rate construct is a little nuanced but it would help us as well because obviously it would allow us potentially, if you think about the 8 gigawatts of solar that we're going to be executing on over the next 15 to 20 years we're currently structured to at a minimum own about half of that. And if we can be more competitive, because of that benefit with the \u2013 obviously, the elimination of normalization then we could potentially pencil the own projects in a manner that's comparable with the PPA or contracted portion. And that would make a case for owning more than 50% over time. And so obviously, that could add to rate base opportunities. So we feel quite good about, what we've read today. But again, obviously more to digest. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Clearly, clearly. Okay. Thank you, guys speaking for him [ph] Rejji Hayes : Thank you Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. Your line is open. Rejji Hayes : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Hi, good morning, guys. Two clarifying questions. First, is for 2022 did you say that the entire $0.24 to $0.28 negative red bar is conservatism? I know you said you're trending well and you've affirmed guidance. But did I hear you right, is that all conservatism? And second part of that question is, you mentioned the potential to accelerate O&M expenses through 2023. Have you started that yet, or are you waiting to get through the summer and the storm season? How flexible can you be to do that late in the year in other words? Rejji Hayes : Yes. Andrew, thanks for the question. I would say starting with that $0.24 to $0.28 a negative variance in the six months to go bucket of that waterfall chart on Page 7, that is a combination of conservative planning. And so that's really a catch-all bucket. And so we've got in their non-weather sales assumption year to go. We've got a little enterprises performance and so -- and some parent expenses. So there's conservatism, as it pertains to those variables, but the vast majority of that is just contingency that we've accrued, just based on the performance in the first half of the year. And so obviously, weather was -- has been a big help. It's offered upside to plan. We've seen a little cost performance as well and a little bit of non-weather upside. So sales have been strong as well as cost performance and that's, what's driving a good portion of that bucket. So it's really just where we've parked the contingency, which gives us a lot of flexibility which kind of segues into the second part of your question about what we're doing with respect to pull ahead. And so I would say, at this point because we still have six months ago, we really tried not to do a whole lot because we still have to get through storm season and see where Q3 is which not just from a store perspective, but also in terms of earnings contribution that's usually where we have the vast majority of our EPS contribution. So we've been cautious. We've done a little bit more with respect to forestry and we've done a little bit more reliability work. Obviously, we made some commitments as part of the IRP and gas settlements with respect to low income support. And so those are things we like to do, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities for pull-aheads to de-risk 2023, some more going into the second half of the year. It's also important to remember, we also put in place a really nice regulatory mechanism a few years ago our voluntary refund mechanism, which effectively allows us to make decisions late in the year from an operational pull-ahead perspective get effectively the accounting benefit, in the current year and then a commitment to do work in the subsequent year. And so that gives us even more flexibility, as we head into the Q4 and deep into Q4, if we're seeing upside that's in excess of plan. It just gives us a bit more flexibility to commit to more work and again see the sort of accounting benefits of that in the current year. So a lot of flexibility going forward. We've made some moves to date from an O&M, pull ahead perspective. But again we're obviously, cautious at this point because we've got a lot of Q3 left and we're waiting to see what happens with storms and weather. Andrew Weisel : Great. Yes, that's definitely a helpful mechanism you have. And then the other question, I just wanted to clarify on equity. So I guess first question is, when would you decide how to finance Covert and could that be something like an equity forward to de-risked? And then just to be very clear, beyond financing that acquisition, are you still affirming no plans for equity in the general business financing? Rejji Hayes : Yes. To answer the last question first, if you put aside the potential funding of Covert as we mentioned on the call today with potentially considering equity, there is no plan to issue equity beyond that until 2025, as per our initial guidance when we rolled out our $14.3 billion five-year plan in Q1 of this year. So we're still committed to not issuing equity through 2024 or more specifically until 2025, but for the funding of Covert.  And in terms of how we'll time that and how we'll think through that obviously we'll look at the valuation of the stock versus the relative cost of other hybrid securities and we'll look to be opportunistic from time to time. And we've seen just great pricing in the past with those dribble programs. And so, we'll look to utilize some of that. But again, I think we've got a lot of flexibility because we're not scheduled to acquire Covert until May of next year. So quite a bit of time to evaluate and we'll be opportunistic and dribble out so likely over the coming months. Andrew Weisel : Thank you very much. That\u2019s helpful. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David Arcaro : Good morning, thanks so much for taking my question. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just comment on how you see the equity ratio at the utilities trending over time after we saw it tick down a little bit in the gas rate case? Rejji Hayes : Yes. David thanks for the question. Obviously, we would love to see equity ratios if not stabilize go the other way and go up because we do believe that we have yet to see a remediation from tax reform when it was enacted in 2017, which led to a 200-basis point degradation in our FFO to debt overnight, as well as cash flow degradation. And so, we're going to continue to make the case. In our cases that we filed that equity thickness should go up. And again, we'll make the case going forward. And what I would mention is obviously in the case of the gas rate case settlement there were a number of stakeholders involved in that process we thought given the circumstances and all the other constructive aspects of the settlement. We were comfortable with the equity thickness where it was. But again, we still think it should be higher than that.  I think it's also important to note that we still have deferred tax flowbacks from tax reform where again we're giving back deferred taxes to customers. And that has the effect of skinning-in [ph] or reducing the 0 cost of capital component in our rate making capital structure which offset some of that reduction in the authorized equity thickness. And so to be very specific here, our equity thickness in this gas settlement went down from a little over 52% to about 50.75%. So roughly 130 basis points of reduction. However, about 50 basis points of that was offset in our ratemaking equity thickness because of the 0 \u2013 the reduction of that 0 cost of capital layer. And so, again we'll continue to make the case. We still think equity thickness should continue to go up or should start to go up. And again, the onus is on us to make the case. David Arcaro : Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful color. And the other topic I was curious about was on the CGP. And could you talk about your progress there? And if you see a case for seeing momentum kind of accelerate in customer interest? Garrick Rochow : Yes. We certainly see a lot of customer interest. We've seen some additional contracts over the quarter. Due to nondisclosure agreements, I can't talk about all of them. One of my pen-share [ph] is, the state of Michigan signed a contract over the quarter. And so, recall that's 1,000 megawatts of renewable build incremental to our plan. And so, we're starting to layer in those contracts as we move forward and have those customers secured.  In addition we look at -- went out to RFP to look at what would cost to construct that 1,000 megawatts. And again. I want to put it as a 1,000 it's going to come very module. It's going to come in little tranches as we build out for our customers, but still good interest -- really good interest and we continue to lap contracts to support that build. Is that helpful? David Arcaro : Okay Garrick. Yes. No that's helpful. Thanks. Maybe one more just quick one, to the extent out Rejji you were to do common equity or something with kind of 100% equity content here for Covert. Does that offset potential equity needs later in the plan just given the initial thinking was something with lower equity content 50% or so? Rejji Hayes : So I'm just going to go back to what we committed to when we rolled out our five-year plan again, before the IRP and before Covert. So just so everyone's granted. So we said $14.3 billion of capital and we would not need to issue equity until 2025 and 2026 of the outer years of the plan. And at that point we would do about $250 million per year in 2025 and 2026. So now with Covert, we said, we may dribble a portion of that. And I would say the funding of Covert, that's not going to eliminate those outer-year needs if that's specifically the question. So the $250 million we said we'd issue in 2025 and 2026, because we're issuing equity to fund Covert. Where we sit today we don't think that obviates the need to do that equity in those outer years. But we'll see I mean obviously we'll see what happens with respect to economic performance, load, EPS how much earnings we retain and so on. But again, from where we sit today this does not eliminate need for equity in those outer years. David Arcaro : Okay, great. Thanks. Yeah was get met. Much appreciate it. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Garrick Rochow : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Levine from Citi. Your line is open. Ryan Levine : Good morning. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Levine : Good morning. Hoping to follow-up on residential load patterns, it looks like your year-over-year residential load on a weather-normalized basis is a little bit softer than some of your peers in the neighboring jurisdictions. Curious, if there's any color you could share around the drivers of what you're seeing in your service territory? Rejji Hayes : Yeah. So our residential load to be clear Ryan, are you speaking about it you said year-to-date 2022? Ryan Levine : Year-to-date and for the -- it seems like second quarter was a little bit better than first quarter, but curious what you're seeing. Rejji Hayes : Yeah. So year-to-date, yeah, like I said about a little over 0.5% down versus year-to-date 2021 and then on a quarterly basis Q2 was a little about up about 25 basis points versus Q2 of 2021. And so as we said in the past, we've actually been quite pleased with what we've seen -- we've been quite pleased with what we've seen so far in terms of residential load. It exceeds our expectations. We assumed a much more aggressive sort of return to work or return facilities type of work environment in 2022. And we're still seeing pretty good stickiness in that hybrid work environment and still seeing pretty good load in the residential segment which obviously is higher margin. So it's exceeded our expectations of performance. I can't speak to the performance of others but we've been quite pleased with what we've seen being down only about 0.5% year-to-date. And again, I'll remind you, we're up over 2% versus where we were pre-pandemic. So the stickiness and resilience is still there and that's obviously offering favorable mix. I think it's also worth noting that we plan. And we'll continue to plan incredibly conservatively Ryan. And so when we see performance like that even though it's slightly down it's still offering upside relative to plan. Garrick Rochow : I just want to add on to this too, in both 2020 and 2021 we saw record interconnections service line connections with residential homes. And so record from a company perspective an annual perspective. And so Again, I can't compare that to what other utilities are seeing. But for us it's really nice residential load performance across our service territory. Ryan Levine : I appreciate that. And then a follow-up on some of the kind of potential pull forward of 2023 costs into 2022 you highlighted forestry and a few other items. Curious, if you're seeing anything on the labor front may -- to combat some of the inflationary pressures and competition for labor that may lead to some elevated costs in the back half of the year? Garrick Rochow : Well, remember one of the -- just -- roughly 40% of our workforce is unionized and we have a union contract for those and those were signed in 2020. And that contract is a five-year contract that goes to 2025. And so there's some normal escalation. But you go back to 2020 when that contract was signed again we didn't see quite dis-inflationary pressure. And so again it's measured it's budgeted it's planned for. And so I'm not seeing much change there. Across our non-unionized workforce we've had roughly -- our retention rate -- we haven't seen the Great Resignation at all. And we've seen solid retention across the pandemic period. And so again we haven't had to go out and do a lot of hiring over the time period. And so that's been helpful too from a cost perspective labor perspective. Ryan Levine : I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions. I'll now hand back to Mr. Garrick Rochow, for closing remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thanks Elliot. And thank you everyone for joining us today. Take care. And stay safe. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder that there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at 12 :00 p.m. Eastern Time, running through November 3rd. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Sri Maddipati : Thank you, Maxine. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased with the results for the quarter and the path to year-end. But before I get into specifics, I want to start with our simple investment thesis, which continues to stay on the test of time. You've seen this in our calls and meetings and you've seen the results. It works. This is where we put our words into action. We remain firmly committed to leading the clean energy transformation. As I mentioned on the Q2 call, the approval of our IRP was a proof point, evident that we have a clear pathway supported by the regulatory construct to deliver on our leading clean energy commitment. Our investment thesis is fueled by our commitment to eliminate waste, driven by the CE Way. I put us up against anyone in our ability to take cost out. This year, we are on track to take $50 million of O&M waste out of the business. The CE Way is critical to delivering our operational and financial performance and keeping our service affordable for our customers. Another critical element is our top-tier regulatory backdrop in Michigan. In Q2, we not only delivered our IRP, but we settled our gas rate case. And in this quarter, we received constructive feedback on our pending electric rate case, further evidence of the health of the Michigan regulatory environment. A key part of our investment thesis, which we don't talk about enough is our diverse and attractive service territory. I'm excited about both the pace and impact of new growth in Michigan. Just this month, our governor announced that Goshen, a global electric vehicle battery manufacturer selected Michigan for its U.S. expansion over many other states, highlighting another example of onshoring manufacturing within the state. This project is expected to add over 2,000 jobs and provide $2.4 billion of investment. In August, President Biden joined Governor Whitmer at Hemlock Semiconductor headquartered here in the heart of our service territory. Together, they announced an executive directive to guide the implementation of the CHIPS Act, which will boost domestic chip production and bolster Michigan's leadership in the semiconductor industry. Let me put that into perspective. Hemlock is one of the largest polysilicon manufacturers in the world. Nearly one third of the world's ships are made from polysilicon produced at that facility right here in Michigan. In September, Hemlock announced plans to grow its operation. The project is expected to add 170 jobs and $375 million of investment in the state. Ground has already been broken on the expansion. Also the expansion of SK Siltron, now in operation, a semiconductor wafer manufacturer bringing 150 jobs and over $300 million of investment to the state. These are highlights over the quarter. From the map on the slide, you can see we secured over 80 agreements year-to-date, which translates to roughly 200 megawatts of new or expanding load in our service territory. This growth is bolstered by collaborative and innovative economic development efforts, supported by competitive rates for energy-intensive customers and robust policy, which are working and continue to drive growth. Our work with the Governor's office, the legislature, Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the commission has made it possible for Michigan to not only compete, but win investment and new jobs. These economic tailwinds are just a few of many we've seen and continue to see across Michigan that will help attract more business. grow industrial, commercial and residential load and ultimately provide long-term bill relief for all our customers. Our strong commitment to decarbonize both our gas and electric systems is a key differentiator for CMS Energy. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act is another catalyst for our clean energy transformation, supporting deployment of renewables and lowering costs for our customers. We see a lot of benefit in this new legislation. The extension of tax credits for both wind and solar provide economic certainty and lowers cost for our robust renewal backlog within our IRP which includes 8 gigawatts of solar, as well as the remaining 200 megawatts of wind, we are constructing to meet Michigan's renewable portfolio standard. Production tax credits for solar projects will drive cost competitiveness for utility-owned projects versus PPAs. As we build scale, this cost competitiveness has enabled us to own in rate base a greater portion of future IRP solar investment. The investment tax credit for storage will lower cost and provide greater flexibility as we're able to site storage strategically across the grid. Our IRP includes 75 megawatts of battery storage, beginning in 2024, and could accelerate or increase the 550 megawatts of battery storage through 2040. These tax advantages reduce the cost of new solar roughly 15%, providing annual cost savings of $60 million versus our plan. Also, with the use of tax deductions and credit, we do not expect a material impact in the alternative minimum tax through the remainder of the decade. All of this helps our customers with more savings. It's a supports our commitment to grow Michigan. It drives the transformation to clean energy and our growing voluntary green pricing program. Bottom line, this legislation is a great tailwind across the board. Now let's get into the numbers. Year-to-date, we've delivered $2.29 of adjusted earnings per share and remain ahead of plan. With confidence in this year, we're raising the bottom end of our guidance to $2.87 to $2.89 per share from $2.85 to $2.89 per share. For 2023, we are initiating our full year preliminary guidance of $3.05 to $3.11 per share, which reflects 6% to 8% growth off the midpoint of our revised 2022 guidance, and we expect to be toward the high end of that range. And remember, we've always rebase our guidance of actual compounding our growth. This brings you a higher quality of earnings and differentiates us from others in the sector. Our long-term dividend growth remains at 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. We'll provide you with an update on our guidance, as well as a refresh of our 5-year capital plan on the Q4 call early next year. Lastly, we are confident in both our outlook and our ability to deliver our financial and operational targets for the remainder of the year, which brings me to my last slide. In a few weeks, Michigan will have elections across the state. New people will join the legislature. We'll also see the results of the race for governor. Whatever the outcome, we will work effectively as we have for a decade with whoever holds off it. You've heard us say it before. We deliver regardless of conditions, nearly two decades of industry-leading financial performance. You can count on CMS Energy for that. Now I'll turn the call over to Rejji to offer additional detail. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick. And good morning, everyone. As Garrick noted, our third quarter results are a continuation of the strong performance we have delivered throughout the year, keeping us ahead of plan and positioning us well to achieve our financial objectives in 2022. To elaborate, year-to-date, we have delivered adjusted net income of $662 million or $2.29 per share, up $0.11 per share versus the comparable period in 2021, largely driven by favorable weather, including more normalized storm activity in our service territory and healthy economic conditions in the state. The waterfall chart on Slide 8 provides more details on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2021. As Garrick mentioned, our solid year-to-date performance has driven our revised 2022 adjusted EPS guidance, which reflects an increase in the lower end of the range to $2.87 from $2.85. So our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance has now been raised and narrowed to $2.87 to $2.89. As noted, favorable sales continue to be the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance, largely driven by weather, equating to $0.13 per share of positive variance. Our strong sales were partially offset by planned increases in operating and maintenance or O&M expense, largely driven by customer initiatives, which are embedded in rates to improve safety, reliability and our rate of decarbonization to the tune of $0.03 per share of negative variance versus the first 9 months of 2021. It is worth noting that the aforementioned year-over-year increase in O&M expense was partially offset by lower service restoration expense versus the comparable period in 2021 as anticipated. Lastly, the $0.01 per share of positive variance in the final year-to-date bucket reflects higher non-weather sales of the utility attributable to continued strong commercial and industrial load in our electric business, slightly offset by a drag of the parent from our preferred stock dividend and select regulatory items. As we look to the fourth quarter, we feel quite good about the glide path to achieve our revised full year EPS guidance range. As always, we plan for normal weather, which we estimate will have a positive impact of about $0.08 per share versus the comparable period in 2021. We're also assuming - we are also assuming $0.11 per share of positive variance versus the fourth quarter of 2021 attributable to rate relief associated with the October 1 implementation of new rates from our constructive gas rate case settlement earlier this year. And these estimates are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation, property taxes and interest expense. In addition to said cost, our plan assumes increased O&M expense in the fourth quarter versus 2021 for key customer programs such as vegetation management, one of the most effective measures to reduce system outages. And I'll note that we're on course for a record level of vegetation management spend in 2022, given our focus on improving the reliability of our grid. We also expect to continue to benefit from normalized storm activity, which nets to $0.11 per share positive variance versus the comparable period in 2021. To close out our assumptions for the remainder of 2022, we assume the usual conservative assumptions for our non-utility business and weather normalized load at the utility. We have also maintained a healthy level of contingency given our strong year-to-date performance which when coupled with our non-utility and load assumptions equates to $0.17 to $0.19 per share, a negative variance highlighted in the [indiscernible] chart. As such, we have substantial financial flexibility heading into the final three months of the year, which increases our confidence in delivering for customers and investors in 2022 and beyond. Turning to our 2022 financing plan on Slide nine. I'm pleased to report that we have successfully completed our planned financings for the year with $800 million of debt issuances at the utility priced at a weighted average coupon of 3.9% which is well below indicative levels in the current environment. \\ And while our plan did not call for any financing at the parent this year, we opportunistically priced approximately $440 million of equity forward contracts during the quarter at a weighted average price of $68 per share. Our timely execution of the equity forward locks in attractive terms for the parent financing needs of the pending acquisition of the new covert natural gas generation facility. The settlement of the equity forward will largely occur in the first half of 2023 concurrent with the acquisition timing and in accordance with our recently approved integrated resource plan. Staying on the balance sheet. As we move into the winter heating season, we have preserved a strong liquidity position, which supplements our use of commercial paper. And needless to say, we'll continue to monitor market conditions to try to lock in attractive terms for future financing opportunities at the utility. Lastly, it's important to highlight that we have no debt maturities or planned financings at the parent in 2023 and virtually no floating rate exposure outside of the utility, which largely insulates our income statement from future interest rate volatility. Our opportunistic a prudent financing strategy reduces cost while limiting uncertainty in our cost structure, enabling us to fund our capital plan in a cost-efficient manner for the benefit of customers and investors. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Maxine to open the lines for Q&A. Q - Insoo Kim : Yeah, thank you. Thanks for the update. Just first question, I think there's just been a lot of conversation about the recent opening of the docket [ph] for the Michigan store mode [ph] at process. Could you just give me give a \u2013 give us an indication of the conversations you've had with the commission kind of where their head's at and what the potential range of outcomes could be here? Garrick Rochow : Yes. Thanks, Insoo, for your question. A couple of things on this. I think it's important to understand, particularly in August here had some storm. We performed well during the storm. But again, it's catching a little media attention. And I think one of the things that's really important to recognize here in Michigan is the impacts the great Lakes and what Lake Michigan does to the weather and storms. And then also just a longer-term trend we see is increasing wind speeds across Michigan in part due to climate change. And the bottom line is we see a real investment opportunity and resiliency. The commission has been supportive of many of the reliability and resiliency efforts in our electric rate case, but there's more to do. There's more to do in this space. And so I really view this as a collaboration where we can work to. Again, I think we're both the commission and the company are well aligned here in what we need to do in terms of reliability and resiliency. So I really view it as an opportunity where those opportunities are and create the path to improve that for our customers. Insoo Kim : Is there a set time line on when we should have more clarity on the outcome from all of this? Garrick Rochow : There is a first effort that's due here in November 4th. I would imagine the audit takes place over much of the fiscal year of 2023. And again, I see that as a collaborative effort. We want the same thing. We have the same goal, and it's really aligned to make sure we have all the right measures and investments in place to achieve that goal and they're at the right speed and pacing. Insoo Kim : Got it. My last question, just thank you for the preliminary guidance on '23 and pointing to that upper end. Should we think of the Covert acquisition and the financing all embedded in that upper end? And I guess, what potential items could deviate from that range even if it could be a potential upside from there? Thanks. Garrick Rochow : Yeah. The short answer is yes, on Covert and the financing is in that piece. But I'm going to just step back and think of the bigger picture here. And so how I think about this and how we think about this as a company. So this guidance here is 6% to 8%, and we expect toward the high end. We really think that offers a premium across the sector. And we've been doing this for 20 years of industry-leading financial performance. And then I think what's unique about us, and again, differentiates us and there's a strength and frankly, a premium is that we rebase off of actual. So we do this time and time again. And so we're not in the sugar highs. It's a long-term play where we're going to continue to deliver towards the high end. So I feel good. We feel good about the guidance we've offered here today at 305 to 311 and one more thing on this. I want to make sure everyone understands, too, that this is an important balance, a balance of our customers, other stakeholders like regulators and legislators as well as you, our investors. Insoo Kim : Got it. Thank so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Shar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Good morning. Garrick Rochow : Hey, good morning, Shar.\\ Shar Pourreza : Morning, morning. So just a question on IRA [ph], I guess, how impacted your thoughts around the IRP. I mean clearly, you guys highlighted the customer benefits and lower cost of solar, but does it or can it trigger I guess, any sort of revision to the plan as it currently stands? Garrick, I think you may have alluded to a little bit of that in the prepared. And in particular, do you have any sort of tax equity embedded in renewable spending? And do you have any opportunity to avoid tax equity where we could see a potential increase in rate base? Garrick Rochow : I'll tag team this with Rejji here. This IRA is really beneficial for our industry and beneficial for our customers. And so as you know, we've laid out our IRP to 8 gigawatts, the storage build, it's a nice plan. And we go in every three to five years to revise that. And so in the short term, I really see the benefit of the IRA in this production tax credit flowing right to our customers. That's the $60 million per year versus plan. So that, again, keeps our customers' costs low, frankly. And remember, this IRP had $600 million of savings already baked in over that, and this is incremental to that. So again, feel good about that. In respect to my other comments, we'll file, refile our IRP in three to five years. And with this - with the IRA, there's upside opportunities in terms of our tailwind opportunities in terms of pulling renewables forward, potentially Poland storage forward. We'll have to take a look at that. Again, I see this as a real advantage to utility-owned solar and storage versus PPAs. I know Rejji, you may have additional comments. Rejji Hayes : Yeah, sure. I would only add a couple of comments here. The other benefit, too, is just with the continuation of the tax credit for electric vehicles, well, that certainly could be a catalyst in accelerating the tipping point of electric vehicle proliferation in Michigan, and obviously, that would bring rate benefits as well because you're growing the denominator in that rate calculation, bring kilowatt hours into Michigan, which we would welcome. So there's a benefit there that should be, at some point, incorporated into our financials longer term. With respect to your question around financing, we are not presupposing any tax equity in our funding strategy. So the IRA, there's been a lot of talk about the transferability of credits. I still think there's more guidance required from the IRS and we'll see what type of market develops as a result of transferability of credits. We certainly do have credits so we can monetize at some point. But at the moment, we're not presupposing any tax equity in our financing assumptions. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Got you. Sorry, just a quick follow-up. It's just I guess you guys have never had a shortage of capital growth opportunities, right? It's always been a function of bills and rates being at kind of the governor, customer rates. I guess, the $60 million incremental in customer savings, does that allow a pull forward of some of that spend because you have that incremental headroom? Or do we have to wait for the additional IRP filing? I guess I'm just trying to figure out how that plays in. Garrick Rochow : Yeah. I don't think you have to wait until the IRP filing for that. It's really a function of how we build out our capital plan. And as we've shared historically, we look at what the customer can afford. We look at how can we execute work, we look at the business cases, we look at the mix, where we put in dollars strategically. So there's a bottom-up buildup for that capital plan. And so as we're able to create more headroom or as - we have, in the case of afford [ph] of the bills, we'll look at how do we put those important capital investments into the system that ultimately provide value for our customers. And so that's the balance will strike. And you'll see it as it plays out here in our Q4 call in the 5-year capital. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just a quick one for Rejji. Just I guess beyond the Covert purchase as you guys are looking at your 5-year plan enrolling in more IRP spending into plan, including renewables, do you anticipate any associated financing need or the issuance last quarter took care of those needs as we're thinking about the current plan and slightly beyond the current plan, I guess? Rejji Hayes : Yeah. So I appreciate the question, Shar. And just for Symantec, we haven't issued the equity yet. We just put in place forward contracts. And so we've locked in the price, we'll issue, obviously, over the course of 2023 and the first half of the year. But the forwards we've put in place really provide for the funding for the parent financing needs at Covert, we have yet to roll out obviously a new 5-year plan, but the current plan of $14.3 billion that we're executing on. As you may recall, we've been very consistent in our comments about the equity funding needs being limited to 2025 and 2026, so about $250 million per year in those outer years. And because of the sale of the bank last year, there's no equity needs prior to that. And so we'll see what happens when we start to update the capital plan. And in addition to the comments Garrick offered on how we think about the capital plan, affordability is a constrained remind flu. The other one is financing, and we don't want to over lever over equitize the balance sheet. So we'll be mindful of that. And then obviously, just execution and feasibility of the capital plan of executing on the capital plan is the other thing we'll think through. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. The last point was always trying to get Thank you so much guys, I appreciate it . Rejji Hayes : Thanks. Shar. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Garrick Rochow : Hey. Good morning, Jermey. How are you? Jeremy Tonet : Good, good. Thanks. Just want to talk a bit more on 2023 EPS guide here, if you could, the drivers. I'm just wondering if you could flesh out for us the contribution you can cover in '23. And when you're thinking about sales trends. What do you anticipate for sales trends for '23? How does that compare to kind of current trends? Just trying to get a feel for upside versus downside drivers within the guidance range? Garrick Rochow : Sure. I'll start, and I know Reg will offer some context around it as well. So again, I want to remind everybody, as I stated earlier here that it's 6% to 8% toward the high end, and we're pleased with that. And that includes Colbert [ph] As we've said, the Colbert strengthens and lengthens our plan here. And so when I think about this, this is again, we're playing a long-term game here, where we have this consistency and repeatability of delivering industry-leading financial performance. And so - that's how we're thinking about it as we move in 2023 and then even in the outer years. But Rejji, you walked through some of the specifics, please. Rejji Hayes : Yeah, sure. So Jeremy, again, I appreciate the question. The Colbert acquisition, as we discussed, I think, in Q2 of this year, we anticipate that being about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS upside versus plan. And then the financing for the equity should offer $0.01 or 2 on top of that. And so that's all incorporated into the guide, as Garrick mentioned. And so we could spend more time on the details of that. But that's what's embedded in that 305 to 311 guide. With respect to sales, as you know, we plan conservatively. And so we're assuming as it pertains to weather, that clearly this year so far has been quite good. And so we would anticipate a little bit of a headwind just planning for normal weather versus what is a strong 2022 comp. On the non-weather side, we've been surprised to the upside really starting with the pandemic. And so we've just seen a nice bit of upside in terms of favorable mix with residential load, outperforming expectations the last couple of years. We'll plan conservatively and still assume that you see that pre-pandemic level of residential load. And again, I think we're seeing very good momentum on the commercial and industrial side, and we would expect that to carry on into 2023. And so those are the puts and takes with respect to Colbert and sales. The only thing I would add, just to just finish out on the drivers for 2023 is that clearly, we had a constructive gas rate case settlement earlier this year. And so we should expect to see the benefit of that increase in rates, which went effective October 1 of this year, start to flow into the heating season in Q1 of next year. So for the first 3 or 4 months of 2023. And then we've got a pending electric rate case and anticipate a constructive outcome there as well. So those are kind of the primary drivers. You got Colbert, you've got conservatism on sales. You've got then the rate relief that we anticipate from constructive outcomes. Is that helpful? Jeremy Tonet : Yes. No, that's very helpful. And I just wanted to pivot a little bit to battery storage, if I could. And just wondering if you could provide some more thoughts on how you think the system could potentially change over this decade, especially if renewable penetration ticks higher than planned from IRA benefits? And is there anything else you're watching out for on this front? Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Jeremy. That's a great question. So in our IRP we have 75 megawatts, and that has to take place in \u201824 to 2027. And we've already issued the RFP for that work. And so that's well underway. And so you'll see inclusion of that in our 5-year capital plan. But clearly, what is nice about this ITC and the flexibility that's offered within the IRA is you can have stand-alone solar. So typically, it's been coupled with solar. And so the ability to move storage around and have it be not just a supply asset, but have it be a grid asset, provides a greater amount of flexibility in how we use. And so you can see like the value stacking of a storage of lithium ion and other storage technologies. And so we look forward to that. We're going to continue to look at our 5-year plan, but also in the longer-term strategy and how we might accelerate or how we might think about differently the deployment of lithium I and other storage technologies. And I know Rejji has some comments on this as well. Rejji Hayes : And Jeremy, the only thing I would add is it's important to remember that the IEP is iterative in nature. And so we'll be filing one for the stature at a minimum every 5 years, but our bias will likely be to file sooner than that. And so importance of that and the benefit of it is that as we see a potential descent in the cost curve, whether to Garrick point, it's lithium-ion or any other storage technology, we can incorporate new assumptions in upcoming IRPs.And so We\u2019re assuming in the full plan over the next 15 to 20 years, about 550 megawatts that Garrick noted the 75 megawatts in the short term. But it's a larger portfolio longer term. And again, if the cost curve permits it, we'll look to pull some of that forward and potentially expand it, particularly with the optionality provided with the ITC using it for stand-alone storage as well as opting out of normalization, which is helpful, too. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And just a real quick last one, if I could. Just wondering what the potential impacts for rate payers could be should Palisade successful reopen? And does this change how you think about future customer savings should this transpire? Garrick Rochow : Well, I offer a couple of comments on Palisades. So if we get into technical questions, like we don't own the plant, we don't operate the plant anymore, and we no longer have a purchase power agreement, which was a significant savings for our customers and power supply costs over the course of the year. So technical questions and related questions that should be really directed to old tech or maybe the Department of Energy and the like. But bottom line, here's what we've shared with the Governor's office and with the Michigan Public Service Commission. We'll be open to a purchase power agreement. It has to be much more competitive and much more market-based than it has been historically. And we would expect financial compensation mechanism on that PPA as a new purchase power agreement. So that's really what I'd offer on Palisade at this point. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Makes sense. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it, Listen, just maybe just starting \u2013 hey thank you. Just starting with preliminary, right? I want to focus on that work. Can you emphasize or can you can you piece apart why you used the word preliminary at the outset? What are the moving pieces in your mind, if we can go back to that quickly in terms of when you pivot to a more finalized guidance and what you're watching here in the next few months? I just want to clarify that. Garrick Rochow : Yeah, preliminary because we rebase off actuals, and that's the short of it. And so as we wrap up Q4, which, again, at year-end, I feel good about will deliver within that guidance range we've provided, and then we'll rebase off actuals. And so when I think about this year in this guidance, of course, we've tightened the guidance, raised the bottom end, which should be an indicator of confidence. I'm really thinking about the midpoint of that guidance. And again, managing the work. So imagine storms and other things that come our way that we typically deal with. And then we'll look for reinvestment opportunities also as we go through the remainder of the year. And those reinvestment opportunities derisk 2023 and ensure a path of success for 2023. And so that's how it will play out through the remainder of the year. I don't know if Rejji, you want to add to that? Rejji Hayes : Julien, the only thing I would add in addition to just it's Q3 and we'll rebase off of actuals in Q4 and take into account any contingency deployment over the next couple of months. But the other variables is obviously we have a pending electric rate case, and so we'll have a little bit a couple of months more of visibility into how that's trending. We're certainly in the process of evaluating potential settlement. And so we'll see how things go there. And then at that point, we will have filed the gas rate case. And so we're still thinking through the size and implications of that, and we'll assume a constructive outcome there, but still some variables in place. So that's the other bit of information we'd look for as we establish our 2023 final guidance on our Q4 call early next year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thank you. And then if I can just go back to the last question a little bit. Can you talk about how any revisit of a contract with Holtec and their Palisade could actually feasibly play to that vis-\u00e0-vis your IRP and/or RFP processes. Obviously, it's a little bit less than traditional, I get the DOE's involvement is also less than traditional. But I just want to rehash a little bit like how that would fit into your ongoing processes that are continually in flight admittedly of late have somewhat been crystallized at least in the near term? Garrick Rochow : The RF - so just for context, I know you know this, Julien, but for context for others on the call, there's 700 megawatts within this IRP that's 500 megawatts is dispatchable 200 megawatts of clean energy. That RFP has been issued. It was issued at the end of September. That's going to play out. It's done through a third party because of the potential for an affiliate transaction with the DIG. So that plays out. We anticipate those proposals to be submitted in the December time frame. Those will be evaluated again by the third party. That will take to February. And then we anticipate we'll have some direction in that in the May time frame. I'll likely share it at the May earnings call time line. So that's how it's going to play out. I do not know who will participate in that. Again, it's by a third party. Should Holtec choose to participate with the Palisades plant, and if it comes in at a competitive price, it may be an option out there. And again, because it's not an affiliate, we would earn a financial compensation mechanism or a return on that. So that's the approach that would be - would play out here over the course part of the next eight months. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. I know I can't comment too much on it, but I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Good luck. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thanks, Julien. Operator : Our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. David Arcaro : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You alluded to it, but just any latest thinking on the electric rate case and potential for settlement? And then I was just curious what timing you would be contemplating for the next electric rate case filing at this point? In terms of the gap between the rate cases here? Garrick Rochow : Well, just a little background, too. And so I was really pleased with the team. And we did a lot of work on this electric rate case to improve the quality of the case. And I believe and see it's evident in the fast position on that. It's a constructive starting point that they provided in August. And so as Rejji shared, we're looking at the potential for electric rate case settlement. And so that will continue until the case is final. We anticipate PFD in December and then a final order in February. So that's the current status. And then just the longer we have the opportunity we're a 10-month cycle. And so it will be in early in 2023, would we consider another filing another electric rate case. And that's a little far out for us in terms of - we got to want to see how this one plays out and make sure we're making the right investments for our customers. David Arcaro : Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks. And I was just wondering if you could give the latest in terms of what you're seeing in terms of cost pressures from inflation, whether it be labor materials components and just how that's impacting the O&M outlook here? Garrick Rochow : That's a great question. And I appreciate you started with our customers because that's a key piece. And so just let me give you a little fact here to this. And so, in 2021, we had $75 million of state, federal and some company funds that went to our customers. In 2022, that number was $79 million. And again, just for context, October to October as the fiscal year for state.\\ And so I'm really pleased that we've been able to get money in the hands of our customers. And you'll see from a quarter, our customers have a lower debt balance or bad debt balance on their bills. They're not carrying a big balance. And in fact, from an uncollectibles perspective, we're in a quartile 1 position. So I feel good because our customers are starting out in a better position. Now I'm certainly empathetic and sympathetic to their needs. And so what we know about our customers, when we look at their bill, about 80% of the gas bill is consumption. It's about 90% on an electric bill, we can influence that. We can influence that through our energy waste reduction, energy efficiency programs, and we are doing that. And that's great for our customers. In addition, we're about 30,000 thermostat - the thermostats or those that are most in need, vulnerable customers to help them, again, control the use. We're pushing again with nonprofits and other state and federal funds. And so our focus is clearly on our most vulnerable customers here in this time. And then broadly, as a company, and you asked the question really, have we seen material prices increase? Absolutely, 17% year-over-year. But there's a lot of things we're doing to mitigate that. particularly in the CE Way, $50 million of O&M waste reduction, $90 million -- approaching $90 million on a capital perspective. Our plants ran just again, they ran phenomenally - over the summer months. They got a low heat rate, gas and coal. MISO [ph] was bouncing all around the volatility of the market. Cars were steady state. We saved our customers $500 million year-to-date, \\looks like $700 million by year-end. Again, we used our gas assets, all these storage fields to help manage gas cost impact. So those are the here and now. And then we have a whole host of episodic cost savings $200 million Palisade for PPA, Palisade PPA [indiscernible] $30 million of OEM there. So IRA in that PTC, again, I can go on and on. But you can see we're squarely focused cost reduction for our customers, creating the necessary headroom so we make the right investments to improve the system again for our customers to manage that. And I know Rejji has even more to offer. Rejji Hayes : Yes. Derik, I think you covered all the key points on the cost side. The only thing I'll remind you, David, is that we're still looking at load opportunities as well. The announcement of Goshen from an economic development perspective, the global electric vehicle battery manufacturer out of China. That as we see it is the beginning of what is going to be likely a fruitful period of good economic development opportunities as a result of the good legislation passed over the past several months, the ship that NDRA that really created a once-in-a-generation opportunity to bring really a good load opportunities, excuse me, to Michigan and that helps the equation as well. And I mentioned earlier some of the benefits of the IRA if it accelerates the tipping point for EV proliferation in Michigan that helps the load equation as well. And so we're looking at all the cost opportunities as Garrick enumerated, but we're also looking at top line as well to reduce rates. David Arcaro : Okay. Great. A lot of helpful points there. Thanks so much. And see you soon. Rejji Hayes : Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Travis Miller : Good morning. Thank you. Garrick Rochow : Good morning. Travis. Travis Miller : I was wondering you highlighted, obviously, the business load, the GC coming in, the industrial load. What does that mean in terms of mix of capital investment need or any kind of other need when you're thinking about distribution versus generation? Is that type of load something where you'll get more distribution investment to serve it or more generation type investments to serve it? Garrick Rochow : It's a little bit of both, but the immediate piece is really in the space of distribution. So these companies are located here, like if you take HSC as an example, or Hemlock Semiconductor they're building out that load right now. And so we're looking at the existing substation, how do we offer additional redundancy and build out. In the case of Goshen, again, they're constructing their facilities, so a little further behind from a start point. But again, you're going to be running electric line and build a substation dedicated to that facility. And so the first steps really show up in the distribution space for investments. And you'll see those as part of our 5-year capital plan to be able to, again, build and construct those. And then really there's a beautiful part of the integrated resource plan which continue to look out 20 years and balance the demand needs and the supply needs. And right now, we look long on capacity, really through 2031. So we have room to grow and add these investments. But as that - as Michigan continues to grow, and we continue to add low, we'll make adjustments as we move forward in our subsequent IRPs from a supply side. Is that helpful? Travis? Travis Miller : Yeah. That helps. It's exactly what I was asking. You answered everything else that I had to ask. So I appreciate it and see you in a couple of weeks. Garrick Rochow : Yeah, take care. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Good morning, Garrick. Good morning, Rejji. Congratulations on a great quarter. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Anthony Crowdell : And I apologize, this is real semantic I understand if you just want to ignore the question. But I think about - you talked about the IRP maybe strengthen and lengthen the CMS plan. And then when I fold over to earnings guidance of 6% to 8% towards the high end - if I look at '23 where it's kind of preliminary, it's right now at 7% more than midpoint. I guess I'm trying to reconcile 6% to 8% towards the high end. Is that just take 6% out of out of our planning assumptions? Or is 6% to 8% towards the high end/ Garrick Rochow : I love your question. And I'm not going to ignore it. So let's answer it . I just go back in history a little bit, even pre Interbank. We guided at 6% to 8%, and we always said we had a bias to the midpoint. That's how we approached it. And now our language is definitely different. And it's 6% to 8%, and we expect to be towards the high end. And so that's the approach going forward. And again, we look for repeatability into that. And so as you saw in our 2023 preliminary guidance, it's off that midpoint of 2022, but we again, we're saying 6% to 8% expected to be towards the high end. We'll rebase off actuals, as we always do. But you can expect year after year that we're going to be consistency of industry-leading financial performance that we're going to continue to guide in that 6% to 8% range, again from the high end. That's what it offers. Is that helpful? Anthony Crowdell : Okay. Let's shot at it and then I'm finished. If I look back in the last 18 years, you guys delivered very consistent 7%. Do you view the performance when I look back '18 that you hit the high end of that 6% to 8% range? Garrick Rochow : I don't know what data you have in front of you, but I can only talk about what we have, we're in the context of the call here and our 2023 guidance. So we've said 305 to 311. And I would expect that we would be to the high end of that range. Is that clear it up I wouldn't anticipate the minute, but I would expect the upper half of that range. Anthony Crowdell : Perfect. Thanks and looking forward to seeing you in Hollywood. Operator : Our final question today comes from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Search. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Michael Sullivan : Hey, good morning. Garrick Rochow : Morning, Michael. Michael Sullivan : Just wanted to ask on - just with your own renewables becoming more competitive post IRA, I think the current plan has 50% ownership in there. What is the CapEx associated with that? And if you were to be cost competitive across the board and go to 100%, what would that look like theoretically? Rejji Hayes : Yes, Michael, I assume you're asking about the full portfolio of 8 gigawatts. Is that fair? Michael Sullivan : In the current \u2013yeah, , either way, whatever is easiest for you. The current 5-year plan, the IRP that just got approved/ Rejji Hayes : Yeah. So for the 8 gigawatts, we've roughly quantified in the past that 50% ownership of that could be around $4 billion. But again, with cost curves reducing the way they are. And that was a pre IRA assumption. So presumably, it could be a lower amount of CapEx. But we would expect to own, as Garrick highlighted, greater than 50% over time, if we continue to see the cost of owning continue to be more and more competitive with the cost of contracting. And so we'll revise those estimates over time. In the 5-year plan, currently, we've got about $1 billion of solar in the plan. And obviously, we'll refresh the capital plan in the first quarter as we have our fourth quarter earnings call. next year. So we'll give an update then. But the current plan had about roughly $1 billion in it. Michael Sullivan : Okay. That's super helpful. And then just kind of following along that, again, this is kind of theoretical. But if you start finding that you are more cost competitive more regularly here. Do you limit that at all if that introduces more equity needs into the plan? Rejji Hayes : Yes. So the current construct per the settlement agreement has a natural cap of 60%. And so it's effectively a collar from 50% to 60% for ownership. And so we wouldn't be able contractually to go above that now. But in subsequent IRPs, we could potentially earn more than that. And so we'll revisit it and particularly if we're cost competitive with contracted solutions, we'd like to think that ceiling potentially come off. But I would say Garrick highlighted this earlier, I emphasize it as well. When we think through the capital plan, the constraining factors are three things. It's affordability, so making sure that the rate increases are relatively modest as we execute on the capital plan. We also think about the feasibility of executing. We do not want to significantly grow our workforce to execute on the capital plan because that has structural cost implications. And so there's an operational feasibility aspect we take into it and then there's balance sheet. And we would rather not over equitize or over-lever the balance sheet in order to fund the capital plan. And so that's generally how we think about building out the capital plan, and we'll take that into account as we construct this latest capital plan that we'll provide in the first quarter next year and obviously, subsequent capital plans after that. Michael Sullivan : Thanks, Rejji. Super helpful. Operator : That concludes our Q&A session for today. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Garrick Rochow for closing remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Maxine, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Look forward to seeing you at EEI in a few weeks. Take care and stay safe.

Our net zero commitments backed up by the solid plans in approved Integrated Resource Plan, IRP, provide certainty for investments in clean energy and highlight the supportive regulatory construct in Michigan. Across the company, we are disciplined about taking cost out and working every day to get better. We use the CE Way from corporate functions to the frontline to achieve our operational and financial objectives. This focus keeps customer bills affordable. On the regulatory front, it's been an incredible year. We sold not one, not two, but three major cases highlighting the top-tier regulatory backdrop in Michigan. All of this leads to a premium total shareholder return you've come to expect from CMS Energy. I want to take a few minutes to share some of the big wins we had over the year. First, our commitment to people, our co-workers, who show up every day with the heart of service, and our customers who count on us to be there in any weather with safe, reliable, affordable and clean energy. In 2022, we were recognized nationwide as the Best Employer for Women in the Utility Sector, a Top Employer for Diversity and one of the Best Large Employers by Forbes, this team of co-workers, who continue to deliver results, utilizing the CE Way. In 2022, our co-workers commitment to being best-in-class in the operation of our generating assets saved our customers roughly $560 million. This is more than double what we delivered in 2021 mean our team continues to drive more value by running our own generation, more efficiently than the market. Just to make this real, in December, during the storm Elliott, when others were short power, this team and these generation assets were exporting energy out of Michigan into MISO. And I'm also pleased with the growth in economic development we've seen and helped lead in the state. As I shared in the Q3 call semiconductors, polysilicon and battery manufacturing, up all calling Michigan Home, 230 MW of new and expanding load with over $8 billion of investment in Michigan. A recent Department of Energy study ranks Michigan as a Top 3 state for planned battery plant capacity further differentiating our state and service territory. Our commitment across the state have delivered more load growth, more jobs and more investment, all of which create an environment. And our state looks strong well into the future. We remain focused on getting ready for that future with our IRP, which delivers even more savings to our customers with roughly $600 million in savings over our prior plan and reduces our carbon footprint by over 60% as we exit coal in 2025 amid 8 gigawatts of store and 550 megawatts of battery through 2040. We continued our long track record of managing costs and keeping prices affordable through the CE Way, and delivering $58 million of savings in 2022. This level of discipline to continuously improve has been a contributor to the successful regulatory outcomes in our settled electric and gas rate cases, which is highlighted by the $47 million of regulatory mechanisms to support infrastructure investments and assist customers. This year both our customers and investors will benefit from our $22 million voluntary refund mechanism, a $15 million bill credit and $10 million of customer assistance. These regulatory mechanisms de-risk 2023, while providing needed customer benefit. It's this strong execution in these results that you and we expect and meet our commitment to the triple bottom-line positioning our business for sustainable long-term growth. 2022 marks another year of premium growth. The team continued to deliver regardless of conditions. In 2022, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.89 at the high-end of our guidance range. I'm also pleased to share that we are raising our 2023 adjusted full-year EPS guidance to $3.06 to $3.12 from $3.05 to $3.11 per share, compounding off of 2022 actuals like you would expect from a premium name like CMS Energy. We continue to expect to be toward the high-end of this range, which points to the midpoint or higher signaling are confident as we start the year in a strong position. Furthermore, the CMS Energy Board of Directors recently approved a dividend increase to $1.95 per share for 2023. Longer-term, we continue to have confidence toward the high-end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, and we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. And finally, I'm pleased to share we have refreshed our five-year utility customer investment plan, increasing our prior plan by $1.2 billion to $15.5 billion through 2027. I have confidence in our plan for 2023 and beyond given our longstanding ability to manage the work and consistently deliver industry-leading growth. It's no coincidence that I started my prepared remarks with our investment thesis. We live by it and it works. On Slide 6, we've highlighted our new five-year $15.5 billion utility customer investment plan. This translates to greater than 7% annual rate base growth in support safety and reliability investments in our electric and gas systems and paves the way to a clean-energy future when net zero carbon, methane and greenhouse gas emissions. You will note that about 40% of our customer investments support renewable generation, grid modernization and maintenance service replacements on our gas system, which are critical as we lead the clean energy transformation. Bottom line, we have a long and robust capital runway. Beyond our core investments, we have growth drivers outside of traditional rate base. This includes adders built into legislation where incentives on our energy efficiency and demand response programs and the financial compensation mechanism, FCM we earn on PPAs. We also expect incremental earnings provided by our non-utility business NorthStar Clean Energy as they see continued growth in their contracted renewables, as well as better pricing from capacity and energy sold at our DIG facility. We continue to earn a 10.7% ROE on renewables to meet our renewable portfolio standard and are in the process of completing Heartland Wind Project in 2023. These regulatory incentives are a core part of Michigan's energy law which with our strong regulatory construct continues to support needed customer investments. In addition, the Energy Law provides certainty of recovery before looking 10-month rate cases in regular fuel tracking mechanisms and allow us to help smooth the impact of commodity prices for our customers. I used the word incredible to describe this earlier. We delivered across the board the settlements in IRP and our gas and electric rate cases providing more certainty for 2023 customer investments. This wasn't by accident. We have a supportive law, strong regulatory construct and our improved regulatory approach enables us to work with multiple parties on complex cases and provide the best outcome for our customers and investors. And we plan to continue the strong performance in the next rate case cycle. We filed our gas case in December and we file our next electric rate case later this year with those outcomes providing further certainty for 2024 customer investments. We know a robust customer investment plan in strong regulatory construct loan do not support sustainable growth. Our customers count on us to keep their bills affordable. Inflation has been top of mind for many throughout 2022 and remains so as we enter 2023. First, I'll remind everyone that CMS Energy is well positioned as it relates to the key sources of inflation including labor, materials and commodities. In addition, we delivered roughly $150 million in CE Way savings over the last three years and estimate over $200 million in large, episodic savings as PPAs expire and as we exit coal generation. We're also seeing significant new and expanding commercial and industrial load in our service territory. There is a broad spectrum of growth. Some customers have opened new facilities this year and some are in early construction. These new sales opportunities, both in the short and long-term, allow us to spread our costs across a growing customer base, ultimately reducing rates for all of our customers. It should be no surprised why I'm pleased with 2022, and confident in the 2023 outlook. This proven approach continues to deliver. Now I'll pass the call over to Rejji, who will offer additional detail. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2022 with adjusted net income of $838 million, which translates to $2.89 per share at the high end of our guidance range. The key drivers of our full year 2022 financial performance were higher sales, driven by favorable weather and solid commercial and industrial load. The latter of which is indicative of the attractive economic conditions in our service territory and rate relief net of investments. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher expenses attributable to discrete customer initiatives, which reduce bills, support our most vulnerable customers and improve the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems. Our strong performance in 2022 provided significant financial flexibility at year end, which, as Garrick highlighted, enabled us to de-risk our 2023 financial plan to the benefit of customers and investors, which I'll cover in more detail later. To elaborate on the strength of our financial performance in 2022, on Slide 10, you'll note that we met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. From an EPS perspective, our consistent performance above plan over the course of 2022, enabled us to raise and narrow our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance on our third quarter call. From a financing perspective, we successfully settled $55 million of equity forward contracts as planned and more notably opportunistically priced approximately $440 million of equity forward contracts at a weighted-average price of over $68 per share. To address the parent company's financing need for the pending acquisition of the Covert natural gas generation facility in support of our IRP. The only financial target missed in 2022 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility, which was budgeted for $2.6 billion. We ended the year just shy of that at $2.5 billion, primarily due to the timing of a wind project in support of Michigan's renewable portfolio standard, which was largely pushed into 2023, and is now under construction. Moving to our 2023 EPS guidance on Slide 11, as Garrick noted. We are raising our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance to $3.06 to $3.12 per share from $3.05 to $3.11 per share with continued confidence toward the high end of the range. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility as it has for the past several years and we also assume modest growth for non-utility business NorthStar Clean Energy. Finally, we plan for limited activity at the plant given the lack of financing needs in 2023, beyond the settlement of the aforementioned equity forward contracts for the Covert acquisition, while maintaining the usual conservative assumptions throughout the business. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on Slide 12, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case, amounts to $0.20 per share of negative year-over-year variance, given the absence of the favorable weather we saw in 2022. Additionally, we anticipate $0.14 of EPS pickup attributable to the rate - attributable to rate relief, largely driven by our recent electric and gas rate orders and the expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas rate case later this year. As always, our rate relief, figures are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation, property taxes and utility interest expense. As we turn to our cost structure in 2023, you'll note $0.04 per share of positive variance attributable to continued productivity, driven by the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives underway. Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right hand side, we're assuming the usual conservative estimates around weather-normalized sales and non-utility performance coupled with the benefits of the significant reinvestment activity deployed in the fourth quarter of 2022 through a regulatory filings and traditional operational pull ahead. These assumptions equates to $0.19 to $0.25 of positive variance versus 2022. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions throughout the year to mitigate risks and deliver our operational and financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. On Slide 13, we have a summary of our near and long-term financial objectives. To avoid being repetitive, I'll limit my remarks to the metrics we have not yet covered. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment grade credit ratings and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly. To that end, we'll look to settle the equity forward contracts for the Covert financing in the second quarter of 2023 and have no additional planned equity financing need until 2025. In the outer years of our plan, we intend to resume our At The Market or ATM equity issuance program in the amount of up to $350 million per year in 2025 through 2027, given the substantial increase in our five-year utility customer investment plan. And as such, you can expect us to file a - perspective supplement to reflect this revision to our ATM program later this year. Slide 14 offers more specificity on the balance of our funding needs in 2023, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility, a good portion of which has been priced and or refunded over the past several weeks as noted on the page. In fact, the $825 million of utility bond financings address to date include the $400 million tranche of debt financing required to fund the acquisition of Covert in the second quarter. So we have fully de-risked our financing needs for that critical component of our IRP well in advance with attractive terms to the benefit of customers and investors, which I'll cover in more detail later. To elaborate on the strength of our financial performance in 2022 on Slide 10, you'll note that we met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. From an EPS perspective, our consistent performance above plan over the course of 2022, enable us to raise and narrow our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance on our third quarter call. From a financing perspective, we successfully settled $55 million of equity forward contracts as planned and more notably, opportunistically priced approximately $440 million of equity forward contracts at a weighted average price of over $6 to $8 per share to address the parent company's financing needs for the pending acquisition of the covert natural gas generation facility in support of our IRP. The only financial target missed in 2022 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility which was budgeted for $2.6 billion. We ended the year just shy of that at $2.5 billion, primarily due to the timing of a wind project in support of Michigan's renewable portfolio standard, which was largely pushed into 2023 and is now under construction. Moving to our 2023 EPS guidance on Slide 11. As Garrick noted, we are raising our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance to $3.06 to $3.12 per share from $3.05 to $3.11 per share with continued confidence toward the high end of the range. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility as it has for the past several years, and we also assume modest growth for our nonutility business, North Star Clean Energy. Finally, we plan for limited activity at the parent given the lack of financing needs in 2023 beyond the settlement of the aforementioned equity forward contract for the Covert acquisition, while maintaining the usual conservative assumptions throughout the business. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on Slide 12, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.20 per share of negative year-over-year variance, given the absence of the favorable weather we saw in 2022.

As we turn to our cost structure in 2023, you'll note $0.04 per share of positive variance attributable to continued productivity driven by the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives underway.

To that end, we'll look to settle the equity forward contracts for the Covert financing in the second quarter of 2023 and have no additional planned equity financing needs until 2025. In the outer years of our plan, we intend to resume our at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program in the amount of up to $350 million per year in 2025 through 2027 and given the substantial increase in our 5-year utility customer investment plan. And as such, you can expect us to file a prospectus supplement to reflect this revision to our ATM program later this year. Slide 14 offers more specificity on the balance of our funding needs in 2023, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility a good portion of which has been priced and/or funded over the past several weeks as noted on the page. In fact, the $825 million of utility bond financings addressed to date include the $400 million tranche of debt financing required to fund the acquisition of Covert in the second quarter. So we have fully derisked our financing needs for that critical component of our IRP well in advance with attractive terms to the benefit of customers and investors. And as a reminder, the acquisition of the Covert natural gas facility will enable us to exit coal generation in 2025 and which makes us one of the first vertically integrated utilities in the country to do so. To conclude my remarks on Slide 15, we've refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan is minimized. Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices. Our diverse workforce remains engaged, well-trained and in our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis is how we run our business and has withstood the test of time. It delivers in a very balanced way for all our stakeholders and enables us to consistently deliver our financial objectives. 2022 was an outstanding year, marking our 20th year of industry-leading financial performance. I'm confident in our refresh $15.5 billion utility customer investment plan, the ability to execute on it and in our regulatory construct to support it as well as our solid track record of managing costs we keep customer bills affordable. Finally, we deliver regardless of conditions, not by luck, or accident, but by a great team who runs a proven model, who sees discipline in the work. This is what led to an outstanding 2022 and provides for a strong outlook in 2023 and beyond. With that, Adam, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar, your line is open. Please go ahead. Shahriar Pourreza : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning. So just Garrick, couple of quick questions here. The CapEx update now includes Covert. Can you maybe comment on the impacts of IRA in the plan you presented today? The Clean Energy segment went from 2.8 to 3.1. So it was kind of a fairly modest increase. Were there sort of any assumption changes around tax equity utilization? Or do you anticipate another IRP update would be needed for more fundamental changes to the Clean Energy outlook? Thanks. Garrick Rochow : Thanks Sharh. The $15.5 billion plan, as you indicated, includes Covert and a nice tranche of renewables. And I'll also point out from a VGP perspective, that's that large customer renewable program. It includes the first tranche of that as well. And so happy to dive in a little bit deeper here. But remember this, that Covert and our renewables build is spelled out in our integrated resource plan. So that's the nature of this 5-year plan, both from a renewable and the development of renewals, the Covert acquisition as well as storage and storage deployment. So that's set. And that IRP really serves as the prudency review and then we go through the regulatory cases to recover on those. And so that plan reflects that. Now your specific question on the IRA, that's additional benefit for our customers. as we've shared, that production tax credit offers savings directly on the execution of that plan. By 2026, that's about $60 million a year of savings for our customers. And so that IRP when we originally filed it was around $600 million or settlement, I should say, was around $600 million of savings for our customers. That only grows as a result of the production tax credit and the IRA. And so that's the nature of how we're applying that. I would remind you as well, based on AMT, we don't anticipate being subject to AMT for really the remainder of the decade, the way that's framing up. And so I don't know, Rejji, do you want to add any additional comment to Shar's question? Rejji Hayes : No, I think you laid it out pretty well, Garrick. The only thing I would add, you did ask about tax equity at the utility, we're not assuming a tax equity for financing for any of these projects. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly, just a question on your updated guidance and sort of the embedded assumptions. You're showing $0.04 of cost savings as a driver for '23, but also highlighted roughly $30 million or about $0.10 of cost savings related to Kam 1 and 2 Covert retirements. What level, I guess, of cost inflation is embedded in the $0.04? Is there a headwind on labor materials? And then more importantly, how are you sort of thinking about that O&M flex beyond that $0.04? Is it closer to the $58 million you achieved in '22? Rejji Hayes : Yes, sure. I'll cover most of this, and if Garrick wants to add certainly can. To answer your last question first. We're assuming around $45 million to $50 million of cost reductions attributable to the CE Way. So that's what we have embedded in the plan. And we've been pleased to observe over the last several years now that we're at a run rate now of about $45 million, $50 million, which we hit really the pandemic, sometimes necessity is the mother of invention. And so prior to the pandemic, the run rate was about $10 million of O&M reduction. And then we had a really nice inflection point during the pandemic of about $40 million to $45 million of CE Way-driven savings, and that's -- we've held on to that some time. And so that's the working assumption embedded in the plan. I would say Kam 1 and 2, we do anticipate those savings coming through. We'll see some of that in our power supply costs with just less coal procurement, but also, obviously, on the O&M side, there's clearly less staffing attributable to gas plants versus coal. So you'll see some of the savings there. And so that's largely the inputs that we have flowing through that cost productivity line item or the $0.04 that you're seeing in the waterfall from 2022 to 2023. Is that helpful? Shahriar Pourreza : It is. That\u2019s helpful, Rejji. Thank you, guys. That's all I had. Congrats on the quarter. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy, please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to start off by digging into Dig a little bit if possible. And if I look at Slide 20 here, just wondering if you could walk us through, is this implant or is this upside plan? And just if you could elaborate a little bit, I guess, the future plan for DIG flip to the market or do Michigan customers want the asset? Just trying to see what's happening there. What could happen there? Garrick Rochow : I like the way you teed that up. We're going to dig into DIG. It's kind of like my Ferrari comment when I talk about DIG. I mean you may not know this, but the big plan itself is right across from the River Rouge plant where they make the Ford Lightning. And I just happened to get me a Ford Lightning about three weeks ago. So it performs well better than Ferrari. I'll tell you that. So we're going to call the Ford F-150 lightning in the garage from now going forward. But bottom line, here's what we do at DIG. And it's been a historical practice, which really serves us well as we layer in capacity contracts, multiyear capacity contracts and energy contracts over time. And as everyone knows, energy prices and capacity prices have been continuing to rise. There's that upward pressure in there. And so as we layer in these contracts, it's provided additional benefit, additional return from that facility. And so that's what we're reflecting those contracts that have already been inked, you might say, for the improvement in performance. Now we anticipate that to continue to improve as we layer in additional contracts, particularly in -- we're about 50% contracted both for energy and capacity if you get out to the year '26, '27 in that time frame. So there's potential for upside there. And I'll have Rejji walk through what that upside looks like here in just a moment. But why don't you do that, Rejji, then I'll conclude. Rejji Hayes : Yes. So just to go back to the page you referenced, Jeremy, Page 20 in the deck, you see these dark blue bars here at around $30 million. That's a pretty good run rate for the economics we have locked in through capacity and energy contracts here in 2023. And then as you get to the outer years of the plan, you see these light blue sensitivities in the stacked bar chart, and that represents the opportunity if we start to see continued tightening and therefore, improved economics in the bilateral market. And so in the event we see capacity prices go to about $4.50 per kilowatt month. You can see the incremental upside here from a pretax income basis. And then if it gets closer to CONE, and I'll remind everyone that Zone 7 is priced pretty much at CONE for 2 of the last three planning resource auctions. You could see us at a higher level than that with about $25 million of upside. And so as Garrick noted, we wouldn't see those economics until the out of years of the plan, but there's some opportunity as margin opens up in sort of the '25, '26, '27 time frame. Garrick Rochow : And let me just conclude there. So there's -- that upside is not in the plan, just to be really clear about that. And to the degree there is upside I want to make sure everyone's clear, there's no sugar highs, right? We deliver 6% to 8%, and we have confidence toward the high end. So I just want to be clear on expectations going forward. Jeremy Tonet : That's very helpful there. And I just want to continue, I guess, with kind of bleed or element to the point here. And looking at the back half of the planned growth drivers outside of rate base. Can you walk us through time line for clarity on the pieces there? Just wondering if there's conservatism on those items as we look at kind of outside of rate base growth later date? Rejji Hayes : And just -- thank you for the question, Jeremy. And just for everyone's reference, this is the content we have on Slide 6 of the deck. And so we've always talked about the additional growth drivers beyond the rate base as a result of the very constructive legislation. We have in Michigan. And so there's the energy waste reduction opportunities that we have, and we earn economic incentives on that. There's a financial compensation mechanism that we get on PPAs that has been solidified now in two integrated resource plans. And then there is the 10.7% ROE that we get on renewable projects associated with the renewable portfolio standard of Michigan, which we're still executing on. And then there's additional contribution from North Star. And so all of those offer growth to our earnings profile above and beyond what we get in the rate base. And so that 7% or so you're seeing for rate base growth. These would be additive to that. And I would say you get steady contribution for the majority of these. Jeremy, to get to your question. And so with respect to energy waste reduction, we do expect that to increase gradually over the course of the plan. The PPAs. Those will actually ramp up as we do more solar on the contracted side attributable to the IRP. And then we'll see probably more front-end loaded the wind opportunity and then just steady growth at North Star. And so that's really how you should think about the economic opportunity for those non-rate-base opportunities over the course of the plan. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Jeremy. Operator : The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien, your line is open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, Good morning. This is [indiscernible] on for Julien. My first question is to just to elaborate on the DIG economics and the opportunity there, how do you see the move from a seasonal auction in MISO or two seasonal option MISO from an annual auction kind of impacting that opportunity, if at all? And how should we think about that there? Rejji Hayes : Yes. So we are assessing MISO's new rules around sort of the seasonal auction. I still think when you cut through it, whether it's a historical process of the new process, you're still going to see a continued tightening of Zone 7. It's still a peninsula. You still have limited transmission importation access to the southern border, and you still have Covert retirements. And so when you have those sort of construct, you're going to see just an imbalance between supply and demand and DIG will start to open up in those outer years. And so we anticipate, as I said before, that we'll potentially see more attractive economics as energy and capacity starts to free up in the outages of the plan. The degree to which it's more attractive, we'll see. I think, obviously, there's -- it's early days. But we certainly think what we're showing on the page and that Slide 20 offers at least a representative or is at least indicative as to where prices may go if we see continued tightening. Again, those light blue bars, that upside opportunity is not incorporated in our plan to be very clear. Garrick Rochow : And just to add to that, that old seasonal construct is out there to address resource adequacy. And when you -- the capacity that has been applied over units has the potential to actually reduce some capacity of units. And so that the need grows, certainly in the short to midterm across all of MISO, including Zone 7. So the value of a place like in a facility like DIG should only improve for Rejji's comments. Unidentified Analyst : Great. That's helpful. And switching gears a bit here. Can you quantify the aggregate voluntary regulatory mechanisms in 2022? And as we think about the updated 2023 guidance range, do you have any voluntary mechanism embedded in the range at this time? Rejji Hayes : Yes. So to answer your last question first, Heidi, we do not presuppose any VRM for the 2023 waterfall, or sorry, for our 2023 guidance, and none of that's incorporated in the waterfall, I should say. With respect to the components of the [indiscernible] refill mechanism, we just filed that earlier this year, to be clear, it's $22 million and we're going to allocate a portion of that towards excess capital investments over the course of '22 attributable to emerging capital work like asset relocations demand failures on new business. And so that's a portion of it on the electric side. And then we allocated a good -- the balance of it towards our gas customers, particularly those who are most vulnerable, and we think that's a very prudent use of those resources during these challenging times for customers. And so that's really the spirit of it. Were you also getting at the electric rate case settlement commitments as well? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, yes, correct. And the donations as well as how we should think about kind of what informs the guidance? Rejji Hayes : Yes. And so there's none of that incorporated into the 2023 guide either and just to round out the numbers here. So in the electric rate case settlement, we committed to a $15 million bill credit that will benefit customers in 2023. And again, we recognize the expense of that in 2022, and then there was a $10 million again of low-income customer support, again, recognized in 2022 and customers will benefit from that over the course of this year. And so that's really how it works. And none of that is presupposed in our 2023 guide. Garrick Rochow : And so if I pull up and look at the big picture here, this is why the Michigan regulatory construct is so strong. You have these mechanisms, whether it's the settlement or whether it's a voluntary refund means that allow us to derisk the future year and offer additional customer benefit. And that's exactly what this $47 million is. And so this gives us -- this is why I'm so confident, we're so confident in our ability and the outlook for 2023. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you so much. And congrats again on the results. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Heidi. Operator : The next question is from Michael Sullivan of Wolfe Research. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Sullivan : Good morning. One thing I picked up on in your comments of front Garrick was I think you said improved approach on the regulatory side as kind of being key to some of the settlements last year. Can you just give a little more color on what you meant by that and what that means going forward in terms of like being able to consistently settle? Garrick Rochow : Well, you remember Q4 call last year. And I was in this spot, and we were saying, hey, we need to improve. We didn't get the best order out of the commission. And we said a couple of things on that call. One, we needed to improve our testimony in our business cases. And we did that. We took two months. We delayed the case by two months, and that's exactly what we worked on. We also adjusted our approach for the electric rate case and how we deliver that and interface with the staff on it. That was a learning that we took from our integrated resource plan filing, we extended that to our electric rate case. And then as we got to August, we saw staff position, it was a very constructive staff position because of all the work that had been done in the testimony and business cases, the improvement that had been done. And that was the foundation. So once you have that constructive foundation, that constructive point where staff is, then it's really an opportunity to work through settlement. And that's exactly what we did working with a number of interveners, the Attorney General, the staff, business community, residential community as well as number of environmental interveners to really have a very constructive outcome with this electric rate case. And so as I look forward, we're going to continue to deploy those methods. We're going to continue to improve the process going forward so that we can set ourselves up for settlement or if we have to go to the final order that we can get a constructive order. Michael Sullivan : Great and thanks, that's really helpful. And then just shifting to the CapEx plan and the clean energy spend. Can you guys just quantify like how much on a megawatt basis of renewables you're looking at over the plan and what that looks in terms of split between solar storage, wind? Garrick Rochow : Let me - I'll take a crack at it here and Rejji will jump in a little bit too. So in our IRP, there's - obviously, we're replacing coal. And so, I'll just kind of walk through the whole piece of it, so you can see every component of it. So we're going to add about 1.2 gigawatts, that's the Covert facility. We got this RFP out there for 700 megawatts, 500 is dispatchable, 200 is renewables, which will have a PPA for that will get enough financial compensation mechanism on that portion of it. And then in addition to that, we got about 1.2 gigawatts of renewable build-out in that plan that's spelled out in our IRP. And again, 8 gigawatts over the longer piece of 1.2 roughly in that 5-year window. That's a mix of wind and solar. . And then bottom line, we have also in here, what I call energy efficiency and demand response. Those are also play out in that window as well. And then if you're doing the math on this, we're also keeping Kam 3 and 4 around. That's part of it as well, but that's just more of a capacity look. And so, we're in the process of constructing a wind farm right now. That's part of our renewable portfolio standard. That's the one Rejji mentioned in his comments. It's under construction that's about a couple of hundred megawatts of that plan. And the remainder out there is roughly solar and solar build. I will add this, and Shar asked this question earlier and I didn't finish it. But we also have in this plan 300 -- roughly 300 megawatts of voluntary green pricing. This is our large customer renewable program. We've talked about this over previous calls. It's about 1,000 megawatts. We have ability to build and we have subscriptions for that. And we've got our first, you might say, tranche of subscriptions. And then we're building the first - over the course of this plan, we're building the first 300 megawatts. Is that helpful? Michael Sullivan : Very helpful and also, add thanks a lot. Rejji Hayes : And Michael, the only thing I'd add is that you asked about storage as well. I think Garrick have numerated every last bit, and I'll just add storage. We're assuming around 75 megawatts storage in the plan. I mean, obviously, longer term for the IRP, we'll do more than that, but over the course of this five-year plan, about 75 megawatts. Michael Sullivan : Great, thanks again. Take care. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Bank. Andrew Weisel, please go ahead. Your line is open. Garrick Rochow : How is the new baby? Andrew Weisel : Hi good morning everyone. Garrick Rochow : How is the new baby? Andrew Weisel : Good, she is sleeping through the night this week it's a miracle. I just want to elaborate on an earlier question about the non-rate base drivers. I guess my question is what are the offsets if rate base is growing faster than seven plus these adders you're clear that we shouldn't expect more than 8% growth, no sugar highs. So what's keeping the growth below 8%? Is it the equity in the outer years or something else? Rejji Hayes : Andrew hi, it's Rejji. The only thing I would add is that to Garrick's comment is if you ever need help getting your baby sleep feel free to play back this call. We try to make these calls to the extent [ph]. But to get to your question, I would say, yes, you will see some equity dilution in the outer years of the plan. So as I mentioned, we'll be getting to up to $350 million of equity from '25 through 2027. So that's some of the offset to the non-rate base opportunities. And then we will have some parent funding costs in the outer years of plan beyond equity. So we'll start issuing a little bit of debt. And so that's the other bit as well. So I'd say it's largely on the funding side. I mean is this helpful. Andrew Weisel : Yes. Garrick Rochow : If I just add to it. It's also the mindset that we have. We're going to - we've got great mechanisms in the state in this construct with the VRM that allow us to offer benefit in the next year for our customers and for our investors and that really helps to derisk. And so, that's another reason why we think about it towards really the long-term versus one year in a sugar high. Andrew Weisel : Sounds good. And then on the equity, the number went up. It was up to $250 million, now it's up to $350 million in '25 and beyond. Just wondering what's the driver of that increase? And I know it's up to, but why did it change? Rejji Hayes : Yes, so it's a good question, Andrew. And just to be clear here. So obviously, the capital investment plan has increased materially from the prior vintage. So we were $14.3 billion in the prior five-year plan, we're now $15.5 billion. And we're effectively addressing the Covert needs and that drives about $800 million of that increase. But the balance, we still have incremental investment opportunities above and beyond Covert. And so it's really to balance out the funding for that additional CapEx and obviously maintain our credit metrics kind of in that mid-teens area, which we've always targeted for my prepared remarks. But I will also our general rule of thumb, obviously, is we always want to avoid block equity and we still think even at that level of up to $350 million per year, even where the market cap is right now that's up 2%. And in a perfect world, the market cap will continue to grow, and it will be a much smaller relative to the market cap at that point. So, we think we can triple that out comfortably without any overhang or material pricing risk. Andrew Weisel : Agreed, it's definitely not a risk. Just trying to understand does that mean it's going to be more than $250 million and less than $350 million, the way you see it now? Rejji Hayes : I would say up to $350 million per year. Andrew Weisel : Okay fair enough. Thank you very much. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Arcaro : Hey good morning thanks for taking my question. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, David. David Arcaro : Good morning, I was wondering if you could just specify what you're assuming for load growth in the latest outlook. You had some good commentary too about industrial activity in the state. What are the recent trends you've been experiencing with resi and C&I activity as well? Rejji Hayes : David, this is Rejji. I'll take that. So let me start with what we saw last year, and it was very consistent with our commentary over the course of each quarter, but we just continue to see good load growth on a weather normalized basis in Michigan. And so, we were down about 1% for residential as we have been highlighting that was actually a little better than plan. But then on the commercial side, we were up over 1.5%. And then industrial, excluding one large low margin customer, up over 2.5% so all in, about a point or 1% on a blended basis. And our expectations are, I'd say, a little tempered going into 2023. And so, we anticipate being a little south of that. And so, we would say probably flat to slightly up all in. Resi continuing to come in as people continue to go back to work. But still commercial, I'd say, roughly 0.5 point in industrial between 1.5% to 2%. So we still anticipate decent load growth, and that does not include any of the robust economic development opportunities that we see in our pipeline at the moment as a result of the Chips and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, we continue to see lot of activity, whether it's semiconductor fabs, as Garrick known in his prepared remarks, battery, EV battery supply chain or other energy-intensive businesses. We do hope that we'll see some more, lumpy load opportunity in outer years of the plan so more to come on that. Garrick Rochow : Yes, I just would add to that under Rejji's good comments there. The Chips Act and the IRA and even the IIJ, that's a super acronyms there. But bottom line, they've helped our business, and they've helped a number of other businesses here in the state from a growth perspective. In addition to that, we've been working closely with the legislature with the Governor's office or site incentives that really make our state as competitive as other states that are offering site incentives. That comes in terms of not only investment in the site from a state perspective, but also incentives to locate here, which has been very helpful. We introduced an economic development rate, which further encourages growth here in the state, and we're seeing some nice some nice low growth over the last year and commitments to Michigan, and I expect more here in short order. And so, I'm excited about that and what that means for our state, both from an investment perspective, growth perspective and particular jobs perspective. David Arcaro : Great thanks for all that color, very helpful. And I was just wondering, just looking out the equity needs later in the plan and the balance sheet and cash flow at that point. I was wondering, are there any cash flow impacts that come over time potentially from IRA or as you start ramping up renewables and with tax credit dynamics, anything that could help operating cash flow, free up cash flow to further invest at that point that we should think about just as your investment profile shifts in that direction? Rejji Hayes : Yes, it's a good question, David. So we currently are assuming about $12.5 billion of operating cash flow generation over the duration of this plan. So a healthy level, and that's kind of run rate of $2.5 billion or so per year. So clearly, we'll benefit, as Garrick noted earlier, from just lower costs as a result of the production tax will now apply to solar investments. Whether there's incremental upside opportunity for OCF, we'll see. But we try to plan conservatively, and we feel pretty good about the estimates for OCF and the financing plan going forward. And I think it's also worth noting that we don't anticipate being a material payer of federal taxes through the duration of this plan we'll be a partial taxpayer you start to get to '24 and '25, but federal tax cash payments are not a material source of outflow over the course of this plan. And that's kind of been sort of our norm for some time now. So the team continues to do a very effective tax planning to minimize that outflow. David Arcaro : Okay got you that make sense, thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore. Durgesh, your line is open. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey team, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Durgesh. Durgesh Chopra : Hey good morning Garrick, thank you for taking my question. Hey just Rejji, I want to go back to the equity financing plan. So the CapEx in both '25 and '26 was raised by $100 million, and that seems to all sort of go the equity from $250 to $350 million. Did the assumptions change in cash flow or did anything else change or you're just building some flexibility in this line. So if you could just talk to that, please? Rejji Hayes : I would say it's more flexibility than anything else. I mean, I would say it's not as formulaic. It's a $100 million increase in the given year equates to 400% equity financing. I think it's more you see about $400 plus million of incremental capital investment above the prior plan and exclusive of Covert. And so, we're just trying to fund that as thoughtfully as possible. But it's not as formulaic as incremental $100 million in '25 and therefore, incremental $100 million, it's much more is a little more art than that. So I would just say just because there is some flexibility. And hopefully, we don't have to do as much of that. But for now, the guidance is up to $350 million per year, and we think that prudently funds the business and keeps those credit metrics in the mid-teens level to keep the credit ratings we have that we've worked very hard to achieve. Durgesh Chopra : Awesome that makes sense. And then maybe just on the Slide 12 here. The $0.19 to $0.25 usage, non-utility tax and other, can you give a little bit of a more detailed breakdown of what's usage and some of the other items, if you can? Rejji Hayes : Yes, so usage non-weather sales, I just provided that in the other question. But like I said, it's flat to slightly up, I would say, about - 25 basis points up all in. We expect residential down over 0.5% as folks come back to pre-pandemic levels. And then you've got commercial up about 0.5 point and then 1.5% to 2% for industrial, again, excluding one large low margin customer. The other big bucket within that $0.19 to $0.25 is just, remember. We had a little of discretionary activities in the fourth quarter. So namely, you've got the VRM which was $22 million, and then you've got another $25 million of electric rate case commitments and so all in that $47 million of Q4 lack [ph] is about $0.12. That does not need to take place in the fourth quarter of this year. And so when you think about that comp of Q4, '22 versus Q4, 2023, you see a lot of that in there. So I'd say it's a combination of those sort of discretionary items that don't need to recur. And then you've got - I'd say relatively modest load assumptions. We've got a little bit of uptick in NorthStar as well. That's the other component of that. And as you can see, we delivered actuals of $0.12 per share at NorthStar in 2022 and the guide for this year 2023 is $0.13 to $0.16. So that's a piece of it as well. It's really those pieces. Is that helpful? Durgesh Chopra : Yes, absolutely. Usage and half of it looks like the Q4 flex from '22 to '23 and a couple of pennies at NorthStar? Rejji Hayes : Bingo. Durgesh Chopra : Thanks so much. Appreciate the time guys, thank you. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Anthony, your line is open. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Hey good morning, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just hopefully two quick ones, one was on DIG. Is there a desired amount of capacity you want to leave open in the plan? Do you look longer term and say we want to keep 50% open or 40% open? Are you guys are more opportunistic on that? Garrick Rochow : Well, right now, if you look at '23, '24, '25, it's 100% or pretty close to it. So we want to in the upcoming two to three years, we want to fully subscribe - from a capacity and energy perspective. And as you layer in contracts time you get up to 2025, '26 it approaches 50%. So there's room there. And absolutely, we're going to take advantage of opportunities in the energy and capacity markets to layer that in so some longer-term contracts to see really to take advantage of the opportunity out there is with energy and capacity prices. Does that help, Anthony? Anthony Crowdell : Yes, absolutely. And then lastly, if I want to maybe look a little longer here, your next IRP filing, I mean the IRP, the guys finished, I guess, I don't know, the '22 or '21, very successful, transformational. What's the timing of the next IRP? And what's that going to look like? Garrick Rochow : It just feels like I got through that this year with the settlement, like I'm celebrated. I'm still in my victory lap of that IRP. It was a landmark. And now you're asking about the next one, yes. Anthony Crowdell : Parked and Lightning in the garage before you do the victory lab yes. Garrick Rochow : So we have to be in there within five years. It's usually a three to five years though. We don't have a plan yet on when that will be. It usually helps to be in around three years just because of the timing of the cycles and of recovery, but no set time yet at this point Anthony, sorry, I can't give you a date yet, but we'll work towards here - the next few years. Anthony Crowdell : Great, thanks so much for taking my questions. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Travis, please go ahead. Your line is open. Travis Miller : Good morning everyone, thank you? Garrick Rochow : Hi Travis, good morning. Travis Miller : You actually couple questions ago, you answered my question about unpacking that other $0.19 to $0.25 on next year's earnings. Just one quick follow-up to that, the usage so that's seven that you used $0.07 on the 1% change in the electric side, especially, is that on the numbers that you talked about in terms of what's in the guidance or is that incremental to what's on that guidance to you? You understand my question? Rejji Hayes : Yes, I do follow you. Yes, so the sensitivities that you see Travis on Page 15. This just highlights what the EPS impact would be if we saw another point good or bad relative to plan. And so, the sensitivity around on the electric side is about $0.07 for every percent. Now it obviously depends on mix. And so we're assuming, like I said, for the usage, about, call it, about 0.25% up on a blended basis with resi coming down a little over 0.5% commercial, about 0.5% up and then industrial 1.5% to 2%. And so modeling purposes, that's sort of the base case. And then if we saw any deviation, that's what the sensitivity, provides visibility on. Does that address your question? Travis Miller : Yes, yes absolutely. And that could be weather sensitivity, right that's not necessarily just why they're normal I think weather benefit or determines. Rejji Hayes : Yes, that's exactly, right. Travis Miller : Okay very good, that's all. Yes that's all I have, appreciate it. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. So I'll hand the call back to Mr. Garrick Rochow for concluding remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Adam. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. Certainly hope to see you on the road over the next coming months. So take care and stay safe. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on the CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded.  [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 p.m. Eastern Time running through May 4. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Sri Maddipati : Thank you, Billy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our commitment to industry-leading financial performance spans two decades and it's this investment thesis that is foundational to our performance. Over that time, we've experienced changes in commissions, legislatures and governors, unplanned weather and storms, recession and a pandemic. In each and every year, we have delivered for our customers and for you, our investors. It's the -- it's the performance you have come to expect from a premium name like CMS Energy and this year is no different. We remain squarely focused on our mission at CMS Energy, making the needed investments in safety, reliability and decarbonization of our system, balanced by customer affordability and our $15.5 billion five-year customer investment plan. These investments in our expansive and aging electric and gas systems are critical to enhance reliability and resiliency and are supported by Michigan's constructive legislation and regulatory framework. Our investments are coupled with our lean operating system, the CE Way, which helps us manage and lower cost. This ongoing drive to see and eliminate waste is evident from the field to the office and helps improve our efficiency, ensuring we deliver customer value while keeping bills affordable. We are committed to this, and I believe we do it better than almost any company in the industry. As we round out the first quarter of 2023, I want to share a few highlights. First, Board's announcement of the Blue Oval Battery Park. This is another important win, which brings $3.5 billion, 2,500 jobs and adds to the growing list of economic development projects in our service territory. We saw additional enrollments in our voluntary green pricing program, supporting the build-out of our first large tranche of owned solar representing 309 megawatts and of a total 1,000 megawatt approved. Preparations continue for the acquisition and transition of the Covert generating facility scheduled for June as approved by our IRP. And in our gas business, we began construction of our mid-Michigan pipeline of $550 million, 56-mile pipeline to enhance deliverability and safety of our natural gas system. I want to be clear, at CMS Energy, year after year, regardless of conditions, we are positioned to deliver. Now let me address the extreme weather we faced in the first quarter. In late February and early March, we experienced the second largest storm event in our service territory. Our line crews are some of the most skilled and experienced in the business, and they showed up with able hands and parts of service and our customers were well served by their dedication. In addition to our crews in the field, there are hundreds of people behind the scenes to support our crews and our communities, including many of our coworkers, who volunteered to serve customers throughout the restoration. I know many of my coworkers join our earnings call. And from my heart, I want to say thank you to each and every one of you for showing up for our customers and for each other. Because of our team, working together to serve, 97% of our customers were with power within three days. In our 135-year history, eight of the most destructive storms have occurred in the last 20 years. That's a significant data point. The severity and frequency of storms we're seeing highlights the need to enhance critical investment and amplify our efforts on the reliability and resiliency of our electric distribution system. We need more undergrounding. This is an area where we are significantly behind some of our Midwest peers. We also need to do more sectionalizing, automated transfer reclosures and looping and overall system hardening. These important investments are critical to improve reliability and resiliency for our customers and will be outlined in our pending electric rate case, and in our updated 5-year electric distribution infrastructure investment plan. We also plan to include an investment recovery mechanism in our upcoming rate case to add certainty to our investment. I'm pleased that our commission has been supportive of reliability improvements, doubling our efforts around tree trimming since 2020. This as well as other customer investments has contributed to the 20% improvement in our reliability in 2022, but there is more work to be done and more needed investment. We will continue to work productively with the commission and the reliability and resiliency of our electric distribution system, so we prepare for increasingly severe weather. We expect further alignment and collaboration and the needed investments in the upcoming storm audit as we work on a common goal of improving our distribution system for all customers. I'm confident in our ability to work with all stakeholders because Michigan has the legislative and regulatory framework in place to enable these investments and to attract the capital needed to drive the changes we all want to see. We have a productive energy law that provides forward-looking test years, constructive ROEs and supportive incentives. It is this environment, which has earned Michigan to rank as a top-tier regulatory jurisdiction for the past decade. Now I know many of you will want to dive into the details of the back and forth in both the regulatory and legislative arenas, which we are happy to do in Q&A., but remember, it's all part of the process. Let me remind you, we have a track record of working with all stakeholders to drive successful outcomes. It's why we settled three cases in 2022. Now I want to be clear where we stand today. We saw both unseasonably warm weather in January and February as well as significant cost with the ice storm. As you would expect, we've taken actions early to counteract that impact. Therefore, we are reaffirming all our financial objectives. Most importantly, our full year guidance of $3.06 to $3.12 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.70. We're also reaffirming our long-term adjusted earnings growth of 6% to 8% per year with continued confidence for the high end and remain committed to annual dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. This isn't our first rodeo, whether it was the pandemic or weather-related, we managed the work to deliver for both customers and investors through the CE Way and other countermeasures already underway, we will offset the unplanned headwinds experienced early in the year. I have confidence in our team and in our plan for 2023 and beyond, given our long-standing commitment and performance. At CMS Energy, we deliver for customers while consistently delivering industry-leading growth. Now I'll hand it over to Rejji to provide some additional details and insights. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of 2023, we delivered adjusted net income of $204 million or $0.70 per share, largely driven by unfavorable weather and costs related to service restoration as a result of the significant storm activity that Garrick noted earlier. To elaborate on the impact of weather on sales, given the well-publicized warm winter experienced in the Midwest, the number of heating degree days in our service territory during the quarter were approximately 18% below normal weather pattern. The atypically warm weather, coupled with a strong comp in the first quarter 2022 resulted in $0.27 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022, as noted on Slide 7. Rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, resulted in $0.03 per share of negative variance as last year's constructive electric and gas rate case settlements were offset primarily by the roll-off of tax benefits realized in the first quarter of 2022 associated with the prior gas rate case settlement as expected. From a cost perspective, as mentioned, our financial performance in the first quarter was significantly impacted by higher operating and maintenance or O&M expenses attributable to storm restoration costs, which resulted in $0.20 per share of negative variance versus the first quarter of 2022. It is worth noting, however, that given the elevated storm costs we've seen over the last few years, we have incorporated fairly conservative assumptions for this cost category in our full year forecast. Looking ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.14 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022 due to the absence of strong sales at the electric utility driven by last year's warm summer. We anticipate that the estimated negative variance attributable to weather will be more than offset by rate relief net of investment-related costs, which we have quantified at $0.17 per share versus the comparable period in 2022. Our underlying assumptions for rate relief are largely driven by last year's successful gas and electric rate case settlements, and we have assumed a constructive outcome in our pending gas rate case. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q4 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense to the utility driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way. And in light of the weather-related headwinds in the first quarter, we have supplemented our planned productivity for the year by limiting hiring, reducing our use of consultants and contractors, accelerating longer-term IT cost reduction initiatives and eliminating other discretionary spending among other activities. These cost performance measures will support the $0.28 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that none of these actions will impact the safety and reliability of our electric and gas business. Lastly, as we discussed during our fourth quarter call, we're assuming modest growth at NorthStar and the benefits associated with the roughly $0.12 per share of pull-aheads achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022 as per our original guidance. And to offer further risk mitigation of the financial headwinds encountered in the first quarter and provide additional contingency should we need it, we have supplemented these opportunities with anticipated cost savings at the parent largely in the form of opportunistic financings and tax planning, which in aggregate, we estimate will drive $0.36 to $0.42 per share positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Before moving on, I'll just note that though our track record of delivering on our financial objectives over the last two weeks -- two decades speaks for itself, we remain perpetually paranoid in our financial planning process. More bluntly, we always do the worryings, so you don't have to. And to that end, I'm pleased to report that we've already begun to see the benefits of the numerous countermeasures implemented in the first quarter. As such, I'm highly confident that we will realize the balance of expected savings over the course of the year. Moving on to the financing plan. Slide 8 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2023, which are largely limited to debt issuances at the utility, a good portion of which has already been priced and/or funded over the past several months. As we have noted in the past, the parent's contribution of the funding needs of the Covert acquisition is in place with roughly $440 million of forward equity contract. This equity will be issued in connection with the acquisition of the facility and we have assumed the associated EPS dilution in our full year guidance. While we don't have any further required financing needs at the parent this year, we will continue to evaluate opportunistic financings to derisk our future funding needs if market conditions are accommodative. Our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the rest of the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances, to the benefit of our customers and investors, and this year is no different. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Rejji. As you look at Slide 9, I'll remind you again, our track record spans two decades of consistent industry-leading results despite changing commissioners, legislatures and governors, recessions, severe weather and storm activity, or a pandemic. We're here for the long haul. We have powered Michigan's progress for nearly a century-and-a-half. And as we look ahead, we see great opportunities to support the state's growth through critical infrastructure as we help power Michigan through the next century. With that, Bailey, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Jeremy, your line is now open. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. And I just wanted to come back to the key focus, I think, in the market at this point, just with the adverse weather and storm headwinds in the first quarter. Great to see that you're still targeting high end of the guide there. And just wondering, as you think about contingency flex this year, I guess, if there is anything else that moves against you, do you have more contingency that could offset that if weather shapes up less than expected or anything else moves against plan? Garrick Rochow : I have confidence in our ability to deliver. That's the first point, Jeremy. And we know there's a lot of year remaining. And so really in all our efforts, we look to build contingency out throughout the year. And so maybe if I just take a step back because I know this is a popular question today and just talk about our playbook. Rejji alluded to it, but let me offer a little more specifics. And I'd break it into really five areas. The first one is we plan conservatively. And you know this, Jeremy. We've done this year after year after year. That's what leads to our consistency, one of the reasons we had consistent financial performance. And also, we talked about this in Q4. What we did in 2022 to derisk the year. And then just adding to Rejji's points, we budget for storms, and we buy it conservatively for storms because we know they occur throughout the year. And so in many cases, this is just a weather story. So the first piece is just we plan conservatively. The second piece of the plan is the CE Way. And you -- this is another strong suit for us. And I'll remind everybody, it's industrial engineering, and it's a lean operating system. It's science, it is proven throughout the years for many different companies. And I see a great opportunity that we continue to deliver on year after year. Scheduling optimization is one example underway right now. We're making capital IT investments to get other efficiency improvements. It improves customer satisfaction while reducing costs. Our run rate has typically been around $50 million a year, as you know, and there's a lot more muscle we have there. The third piece is really around the labor piece. And that is what you would expect. We released some consultants. Our contractors are flexible, so we dialed that down a bit. We pinched back on overtime and then we hold on hiring. And so those things help as well. The fourth area is really discretionary spending. It's limiting conferences and travel and some of the training. And you think that's small, but it's actually big when you apply it across the entire company. And then the fifth piece and Rejji hit on it was, good tax planning and just opportunistic financing. And so that's the recipe. And as I said, this isn't our first rodeo. If you go back to the pandemic, we had to find $100 million. 50% of it came through the CE Way, 50% through other actions, very similar to what we're doing right now. And so we're going to chin this bar, and we're going to add some contingency throughout the year. So I feel very confident in our ability to deliver and to weather whatever Mother Nature throws at us throughout the year. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. And maybe pivoting -- maybe pivoting to the gas case. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. I know the gas case maybe doesn't come as much focus as electric generally speaking. But what are the key focus points across stakeholders in the gas case at this point? And just trying to get a sense for your thoughts on chances for a settlement without getting too far ahead of yourself. Garrick Rochow : First things first, this is a good and constructive starting point. If I was just to dissect it a little bit for you, what we saw from staff in the AG as far as ROE was better than previous staff and AG positions. And so that bodes well for an ROE and some of the financial metrics. The other important piece is we build that -- remember, we built that case over Q3 and Q4 last year. And so gas prices were rising. We also saw some expense from pension OPEB perspective, but when you fast forward to today, those have changed. And so gas prices are lower. We snapped the line at the end of the year on pension and OPEB expense. And so we got a $212 million ask, but that effectively pulls that down because the fact pattern is different than what we saw when we built the case. And then the big piece is that people are talking about here is the sales forecast. And there's about $10 million, $12 million difference there. And so let me walk through that. We have used this method since 2010 to project sales. It's a 15-year regression type model. We haven't changed a bit. It's tried and true and it's accurate. And here's the important point. Back in 2010, the commission ordered us, let me repeat, the commission ordered us to use this method. That was in case U15986. And so we're doing exactly what the commission told us to do. So we feel like really good about where we're positioned there. And so there's a lot of cats and dogs, but bottom line, take this away, it's a good constructive starting point. The other thing you asked about settlement, we'll always look for the opportunity for settlement, but again, we sit in a very constructive jurisdiction. So I'm very comfortable taking it to the end and getting it forward from the commission. Operator : The next question today comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. We will move on to our next question. Our next question today comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning, team. Let me follow up on the first question here just around the uptick in usage, nonutility tax and other. You guys elaborated on it. So not only have you pressed some of those levers to see the quarter-over-quarter change in '23 and the range, right? You're talking about $0.36 to $0.42 of positive offsets there now, but in addition to that, you've got further levers to go to the extent in which they might materialize. I just want to make sure I understand the comment from earlier. Rejji Hayes : Julien, this is Rejji. Yes, you've got it exactly right. And Garrick, I think, offered a wonderful dissertation on how we approach cost reduction opportunities. The only thing I would add to his comments is that when it comes to cost reduction, we don't discriminate. We look across the entire cost structure. When you exclude depreciation, it's about $7 billion annually and about $1 billion of that is a combination of interest expense and tax related spend, combination of federal, state income tax as well as property tax. And so we look across all of those cost categories to identify opportunities. And what you're seeing in that pronouncement bar in that waterfall are opportunities that we anticipate around potential prefunding. As you know, we aggressively look at the maturity profile of our bonds and see if there are opportunities to take out bonds prematurely. So we'll look at those. And then again, on the tax planning side, we're always looking for opportunities to reduce costs, whether that's for state tax, property tax or otherwise. And so that's what's incorporated into that last item. And again, that's all I would add to Garrick's good comments on how we approach cost reduction. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Fair enough. And then just following up on some of the conversation on regulatory mechanisms. You talked about including an investment regulatory mechanism in your upcoming case. Can you talk about what that looks like? And perhaps talk about that in parallel with some of this conversation on ring-fencing here? I mean how do you think about reincenting to isolate spending on specific subject areas? It sounds like this IRM might be related? And then Also, maybe you could talk about ring fencing in the context of veg management efforts. Garrick Rochow : Absolutely, Julien. And you've obviously listened to the Chair Scripps, he's used the word ring fencing around some of the capital investments. So the way we think about it is really, I put it in three buckets. And so the first bucket is really we know that in order to deliver reliability and resiliency for our customers, that's going to take more capital investment. It's just the nature of an aging systems with more severe weather. And so we're all focused on that. The Commission, we're certainly focused on a company. And so as every one of our coworkers here within CMS Energy and the broader Consumers Energy. So we're squarely focused on that first bucket. The second bucket really is what you brought up and that the Commission wants to be able to ring-fence it. And they're looking at a prudency, accountability. And typically, when we've asked for large increases, they want to know that we can do the work, and we have the resources to ramp up. And so that's an important piece. And this IRM, well, this tracking mechanism allows us to do that and provide the accountability that the Commission is looking to see. And so ultimately, that should lead to the third bucket, which is the recovery piece, which is helpful for investors. And so I see all those three working together. And in fact, I want to give you an example. Back in 2011, and I was engaged in 2011, we did a similar on our gas business. We're looking to increase the amount we spent on replacing mains and services. We started a new gas construction group. And the Commission and staff at the time were had questions about -- important questions about how you're going to do that and how are you going to ramp up resources. And so we did a similar type mechanism then, delivering improved safety for our customers, replacing mains and services, and creating that ring fence that accountability associated with the tracking mechanism. And we were very successful. It started out at $85 million back in 2011, and now it's a $250 million program on an annual basis. And so we're taking that same approach as we go through this case. Is that helpful, Julien? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. So perhaps let me just make sure I'm hearing you right. This would that help address some lag related considerations, perhaps shift timing of future cases? Or is this principally about accounting and accountability back to the commission to just make sure the dollars and cents are getting spent in the right bucket? Garrick Rochow : The latter is the main focus. And then -- I mean all the time, it could lead to extend out some rate cases. But our focus right now is just making sure there's the accountability piece and the ring fencing that -- that the Chair has referenced in some of his public comments. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then on the veg management, just quickly, just with respect to that side of the equation, obviously, been a lot of focus on that front. Your commentary saying that you've increased it from 2020, helpful. Any further efforts in that regard? And obviously, there seems to be an acute desire or need for that. How do you think about allocating even more in that direction at this time? Garrick Rochow : Yes. So just to give you some real numbers on this, so about in 2020, it was around $50 million on an annual basis. And with support of the Commission through different cases, we requested more to address this important aspect of reliability, we were up around $100 million on an annual basis. And there's a couple of components of it. And we're continuing to look at other opportunities to invest more in that. But we're also looking at the efficiency of that and so this is an area where we're using technology and artificial intelligence and analytics to be able to better predict where to utilize those dollars. And so we've -- our trees, trim per mile has actually improved over the time period as well. And so that's helpful in the conversations we have with the Commission, and then we'll continue to look for opportunities to look at other areas to invest and improve reliability, much like I said during my comments around the capital investments. I know Rejji wants to add to it as well. Rejji Hayes : Yes, Julien, the only thing I would add is that when we think about the planning year and particularly years in which we have a little bit of upside or contingency, usually vegetation management is one of the first items that comes up on the Flex list. And last year, in fact, and we were -- had a little bit of upside that was weather driven. We did about $5 million or so of flex related to vegetation management. So our actuals, even though we've budgeted around $100 million as Garrick noted for last year, I think our actuals were closer to $105 million, certainly over $100 million. And so Flex is an opportunity for us to do additional vegetation management. And then remember, we have that voluntary refund mechanism, which is also a vehicle through which we can do incremental operating expenses. And so the current voluntary refund mechanism that we have outstanding, we've targeted about $8 million towards additional vegetation management this year out of the $17 million that we allocated to the electric business. And as you know, we obviously pulled that lever in Q4 of last year for $22 million all in. And again, a portion of that will be allocated towards vegetation management, assuming we get Commission approval. So that's the other mechanism we have as well. Operator : Next question today is a follow-up question from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Shahriar Pourreza : Sorry if I missed this, but I just wanted to maybe just round out the storm discussion. I guess, do the storms -- do they -- will they lead to more resiliency spend? Is it going to increase CapEx? Or do you see offsets to CapEx? Are you going to sort of seek any kind of new mechanisms? I mean, some things are already in rider-like items. Would resiliency kind of get that similar treatment? I guess overall, just how do these storms kind of change your thoughts around the 5-year plan? Garrick Rochow : We share -- so just to be really crystal clear on this, there's going to be more capital investment that's needed to improve reliability and resiliency, and it's a reflection of an aging system with more severe weather. And I offered some of that in my prepared remarks, but in this next electric rate case, we're proposing IRM or investment recovery mechanism as a tracker to show and greater certainty around our capital investments. And so that's the intent. We know we have to invest more. There's a number of ways to do that. One is our on it and focusing on that and get alignment with the commission. The other is the rate case and then the other one is the five-year electric distribution investment plan. And so all of those different filings, all those different conversations lead to better alignment and better support for our electric distribution investments. And so the long term is yes in that. And this IRM mechanism, we believe, will create greater accountability with the commission. Chair Scripps has talked about ring-fencing and then ultimately should lead to more recovery of those capital investments. Is that helpful, Shar? Shahriar Pourreza : Yes. And I guess the question is, should we be looking at these incremental investments as extending the runway of your growth or accretive to your growth? Garrick Rochow : Well, we have a long runway, and we invest -- we update our plan every year. But that 5-year plan includes about $6 billion of investments in the electric distribution system. That is up. That was up in this most recent plan. And we'll continue to look at as we model across the system as there's additional investments, we'll continue to look at opportunities to invest more there. There's a long runway of opportunity just given the nature of our system. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Got it. And then maybe just shifting to financing. Financing is -- it's been a bit of a tough headwind, but interest rates seem to have moderated year-to-date. I guess how are you trending versus the embedded interest cost and plan in terms of '23 and maybe even opportunities for some cushion versus '24 since rates have come down versus your original expectations? Rejji Hayes : Yes, sure. This is Rejji. Great question. So as always, I think we had a word count of about 6x or 7x in our prepared remarks, where we talked about planning conservatively. And that has been the case here. And so in our plan, we had pretty conservative assumptions at the operating company, and that's where the vast majority of the issuances are this year. And we've been fortunate for the issuances we've done to date to issue those at levels -- interest rate levels below what we haven't planned. So we're seeing upside, and that's already flowing through our '23 numbers. And obviously, we'll benefit from that in '24 and beyond because we're issuing a long-dated paper. And so certainly, with interest rates moderating over the last several months, that creates additional opportunities, and that's what we'll be mindful of as we look at the final sort of six, seven months of the year and seeing if we can capitalize on the obviously, the accommodative capital markets that we're seeing right now. Operator : Next question today comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Durgesh Chopra : Good morning, guys. Just maybe on the -- just continuing the discussion along storms, can you update us on the investigation that was started by the commission? My understanding is that they were looking for a third-party consultant. So maybe just what's the latest there? Garrick Rochow : Yes, broadly, from the storm audit perspective, so they started that last fall. And in the process of selecting the vendor right now or the firm right now, and we anticipate that to start in the September time frame. But I'll remind you the big picture perspective on the storm audit is that, we're both aligned. That being the Commission and CMS Energy aligned that we need to improve reliability. And so I really view this as an opportunity to be able to get further alignment on the needed investments in our system. I'll give you a great example of undergrounding. We want to do more undergrounding. And if we look at our Midwest peers, they're around 35%, 40% underground. We're at 10%. It goes back to Shar's question. Is there opportunities for investment? There's a lot of them. And so we see that as important. You can look at the EPRI, Electric Power Research Institute and they'll say undergrounding improves reliability, depending on if it's three phase or single phase by 50% to 90%. And so this is a great example where we need -- with the storm model, we can utilize this to get better alignment on immediate investments in the system. And once we have that alignment, then again, we can move forward and get greater certainty around those investments. Does that help, Durgesh? Durgesh Chopra : It absolutely does. But you don't -- I guess the point is, I know you've said this before, you don't see anything punitive coming out of those audits as a result as they kind of go through your processes and other things and fast practices? Garrick Rochow : I don't see anything punitive. No. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. I know this is small, but you've got a decision on the voluntary refund mechanism earlier in the month. And I believe there were some disallowances. Can you talk to that and discuss that briefly? Garrick Rochow : Yes. I'll tag team with Rejji. Just the context around this. These are pretty small dollars. And the bottom line, we have this option to file a voluntary refund mechanism. And we did that in 2022, the dollars are booked in 2022, but it's not a cake walk, like it's not assured that you're going to get approval, staff and the commissioners have a say in that, right? And they really telegraph the importance of incremental forestry and some other things with our customers in terms of helping out those low-income customers. And so they've really given us another opportunity at the bat, and we filed that here on April 21 to reflect the commissioners and staff comments. And so I feel good about getting to a positive outcome on that and it's just navigating kind of the back and forth of the process, Durgesh. Rejji Hayes : Yes. That's the essence of it, Durgesh. Just to give you some specifics on the numbers. So when we filed the VRM in late 2022 it was for $22 million, $5 million of which was to support our vulnerable customers in the gas side of the business. That was fully approved by the commission and where there was some, I'd say, counseling guidance by the commission was on the balance of the $17 million that we allocated to the electric business. And to Garrick's comments, they wanted to see direct customer benefits. And so that's why we have recently, as of last Friday, requested service -- sorry, additional forestry or vegetation management as well as additional support for vulnerable customers. So that's how it's cut. Just that $17 million is subject to further approval and we're confident that we'll get this recent request over the finish line. Operator : Next question today comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. David Arcaro : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Let's see, there's been some legislative bills drafted in the state with some more aggressive net zero targets. I was wondering if that might impact any of your thinking around the next time you address the IRP? Garrick Rochow : Great question. Let me -- I think perspective is really important here because often in Lansing, just part of bill. There's a lot of back and forth, and there's media releases and then you just got to kind of clear the air and talk about it from a big picture perspective. And so I'll remind our listeners here that in the governor's first term, she introduced a healthy climate plan. And in fact, one of the members on my direct staff was one of the stakeholders in that process and was involved in the review and kind of the language around it. And then I participated with a group of about eight to 10 CEOs and the governor in the review process. And so that -- the governor's called the climate plan lines up really well with where we're headed from a state perspective, but also lines up well with our current IRP and the like. Now the legislature has -- the Senate specifically, has introduced some new builds that are a little bit more aggressive, but I want to remind everybody, this is the back and forth of Lansing. And that's the first starting point. That's the first valley you might say. And so we're going to continue to navigate that and move forward with that and manage that process. Ultimately, at the end of the day, if it requires something -- for us to do something sooner, we'll do that sooner. And that will mean more capital investment opportunities. But I want to let everyone know it's really manageable and, again, well aligned with where we're already headed. David Arcaro : Got you. That's helpful. And could you also touch on just what you're seeing in terms of weather normal volumes -- sales volumes and how that's lining up with your expectations so far? Rejji Hayes : David, this is Rejji. Appreciate the question. Yes, weather normalized trends, I will admit we were scratching our heads a little bit at the trends that we saw. And just for everyone's benefit, we saw residential about 2.5 -- a little over 2.5% off versus Q1 of 2022. Commercial, a little over 3.5% off versus Q1 of 2022. Industrial was flat excluding one large low-margin customer. And then total was down about a little over 2.5% versus Q1 of last year. And I would say it's really early days. We are still digging into the data. I would just start by saying, as hard as our sales forecasting team works, weather normalized math is a combination of art and science. And when you see, I'd say, dramatic weather like we saw in Q1 of last year, where it was extremely cold and then a pretty warm winter as we noted earlier, Q1 of this year. You can see a good degree of imprecision in those calculations. And so I say all that to say, we're looking at it with a little bit of a skeptical eye because the reality is we're still seeing very strong economic indicators in the service territory. Our customer count specifically for commercial, we're up almost 0.5% -- over 0.5% to almost one point across the electric and gas businesses residential customer counts are still up. And while we have built into our guidance, that continued return to work, we're still seeing a good level of really not every company in Michigan at this point has four, five days in the office. And so we still think as we get into the summer months, we may see some of that favorable mix we've seen in the past. And so I would say early days, there's probably a little bit of noise in the data. And I'll just say on the industrial side, we were flat again versus where we were last year, but we couldn't have a more robust economic development pipeline borne out of a lot of the constructive federal legislation that's been passed over the 18 months. And we continue to look at our trends versus pre-pandemic and across every customer class we're doing as well, if not better, than what we were doing pre-pandemic, particularly when you take into account our energy efficiency programs, which effectively reduced our load year-over-year by 2%. And so again, I don't think what you're seeing in Q1 and then the data is indicative of the economic conditions in Michigan. I think it's just more a weather-normalized math versus anything else. Operator : Next question today SP1 Come from the line of Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Michael Sullivan : You guys answered a lot here. I just had a couple of small follow-ups on what's already been discussed. So just on the undergrounding, can you maybe just give us a sense on what the long-term target is there? How much of the system you are looking underground and over what period of time you'd like to get there? Garrick Rochow : Great question. And it's important to recognize we're not trying to underground the entire system, and it's really about selective or sometimes I've used the word strategic undergrounding. And again, we know from EPRI research across a number of utilities, you're in a 50% to 90% improvement, whether it's three phase or a single phase. And so ideally, we're trying to get to a point where we can do 400 miles a year. And then really over a 10-year period, kind of increment that up. So I would say the range of around 10,000 miles is really what we're trying to get to overall. It's not going to occur overnight, but that does provide a nice opportunity to enhance the reliability and resilience of our system and provide a nice opportunity from a capital investment standpoint. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Very helpful. And then kind of a similar question just following up on the IRM. I think the context you gave on the gas side was helpful in terms of where it started and where it's gotten to. Can you maybe frame that on the electric side? And I know you haven't officially filed the next case yet, but just kind of where that could start and ultimately go? Garrick Rochow : So we're being very thoughtful about our starting point, and we see it as an opportunity to grow from there. But our first valley will be in the $100 million range for an IRM and then we'll grow it from there. Operator : The next question today comes from the line of Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Andrew Weisel : Let me first say congratulations again for selling EnerBank. I'm very glad we're not spending 3/4 of the call talking about that. Garrick Rochow : I'm glad too. Thank you. Andrew Weisel : Yes. First question, just a follow-up on undergrounding. So you talked about the 50% to 90% operational improvement estimate from EPRI. Do you give a rough sense rule of thumb, the cost difference versus traditional above ground streaming is what a breakeven might look like? Garrick Rochow : So what are the things -- we're doing some -- we've done a lot of -- I shouldn't say a lot, but we're doing a lot of work with our undergrounding crews right now. And that price for undergrounding, particularly on a single phase, is approaching the price of overhead. It's not quite there yet, but close. And so we're in the range on single phase maybe like $250,000 a mile for undergrounding. Again, it's directional bore. And give or take, it depends on the conditions of the soil and homes and other things, but that's roughly the number. And so they're really quite comparable or growing comparable in terms of that price point. And so again, we've got pretty fertile soils. We have pretty soft soils. And so we're not in rock and some of those things, which helps from a cost perspective. Rejji Hayes : Yes, Andrew, the only thing I would add to Garrick's Eric's comments, when you think -- the only thing I would add to Garrick's comments, when you think about the cost benefit and the potential opportunity, if you look at the last few years of our vegetation management plus our service restoration, we're spending on average based on actual is about $200-plus million per year across those two cost categories. And so the opportunity would be over time with those investments in underground and to potentially reduce that overall cost bucket. And so that's how we would think about the cost benefit in addition to some of the points Garrick raised earlier. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. Next one, are you able to tell what's the deferred fuel cost balances now versus at year-end? Rejji Hayes : Yes, I'll take a stab at that, Andrew, and we can follow up with more precision on off-line, if needed. Where we ended the year, we had -- well, goodness into 2022, just over $800 million across our supply costs in the electric side on the gas inventories on the gas side of the business. So call it about a $450 million, $400-ish million split, to $850 million. We started to chip away at that. Obviously, we have very strong cost recovery mechanisms in Michigan, which have been kind of tried and true since the mid-'80s. And so we do expect on the gas side to recover the vast majority of that over the course of this fiscal year. And then for electric, we did apply a bit of elegance to a recovery process for power supply cost. And so of the $450 million we had coming due in January, we filed with the commission a plan to recover that over a 3-year span. So effectively $150 million per year through 2025. And just given the current environment, we thought that, that was the right thing to do to alleviate the cost burden for customers. And we also thought our balance sheet could accommodate it as well. And it's also the way we've structured it, just the fact that we're no longer going to be recovering those costs through working capital now through a regulatory asset, it's actually credit accretive based on how Moody's calculates these -- their FFO. And so for a variety of reasons, it was a nice opportunity, and we've exercised it in the first quarter. Andrew Weisel : Very good. One quick follow-up, if I may. Holtec, I know there's not a whole lot new for you to announce, but can you just give an updated thought on the timing of potential updates there with the state versus the timing of your next IRP, which I believe is likely to come next year. Garrick Rochow : So we do know -- I mean, it's public information that Holtec, who is responsible for decommissioning the facility and has the operating rights there in the facility, has requested federal funding. They've also requested state funding within this budget, which is being worked right now, state budget. So that will be figured out in this May, June, July time frame. They've asked $300 million in the state budget. Again, this is public information. What I would expect to see from this is a lower cost for power. We've had Palisades, it's been expensive PPA when we expect it to be lower given all the tax dollars that are applied there. And that power should flow into Michigan. So those are important components of it. So we expect low-cost power, as I've said historically, and we're open to consider a PPA with the financial compensation mechanism, but at this point, we've got a good IRP in place. And if that comes to fruition, it will shape our next IRP. But it's really too soon to tell on how it would shape upcoming IRPs. Andrew Weisel : Okay. I guess the more specific question was, would the timing of your IRP potentially be influenced by the timing of Palisades resolution? Garrick Rochow : That's too hard to tell. And frankly, this bringing a nuclear plant back as -- to my knowledge, has not been done. And so there's a lot of hurdles and a lot of unknowns there. I'm not saying it can't happen, but there's just a lot of unknowns. And so it's difficult to say whether it will have an impact or not on our next IRP. Operator : Next question today comes from the line of Alex Mortimer from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Alex Mortimer : Thank you very much. So given that everyone in the industry is kind of always walking the tightrope between reliability and then customer bill impact, can you provide sort of any thoughts on what the tone of the commission has been with regards to the undergrounding? Is this something that that they've suggested or something you're sort of bringing to them unprompted? Garrick Rochow : There's been a lot of conversations and there will continue to be more conversations on this important work of undergrounding. We'll be doing some additional piloting within the context of this proposed electric rate case, and then we'll continue to look at other opportunities to build out on that. But going back to the storm model, this is really our opportunity to get further alignment with the Commission on the important investments that need to be made to improve reliability and resiliency. And I would suggest that both the Commission, staff and the company and all our coworkers here, too, are really well aligned on ensuring that we're improving reliability and resiliency. You talked about the affordability piece as well. And that's clearly top of mind. Part of that is we leverage the CE Way, not only to improve our operations and maintenance expense, but we utilize it to improve capital efficiency. So that dollar goes further. Just like I shared earlier, we continue to look at opportunities to bring the cost down of undergrounding and frankly, of all our capital work. Alex Mortimer : Understood. And then just a little bit more color on sort of the time line of what this would look at or what this would look like and then potentially the dollar amount of upside to the CapEx plan? And then should we think of this as getting you kind of into the high 7s towards 8 of your long-term guidance? Or is this more of extending the 7% out beyond sort of where it is currently? Garrick Rochow : So when we introduced in Q4 call, we introduced our $15.5 billion capital investment plan. And that had more electric distribution and electric related spend in that plan was like $6.1 billion of that, which was an increase. We're not changing our capital plan at this point because we increased it just here in the last call. That may change over time because we look at that capital plan every year. And as I've shared, there's a long runway of opportunity there. And so as we get certainty around these investments, as we build out that 5-year electric distribution plan, that will be an opportunity to look at the longer-term capital piece. Now going back to the growth piece. 6% to 8%, we said confidence toward the high end, and that puts it in that range of 7% to 8%. Historically, I've said this, I'll say it again, there are no sugar highs, and we go for consistency year after year. And so that's we compound of access. That's the quality of earnings that we aim for and we will continue to repeat year after year, because we know that's what our investors value. Alex Mortimer : Congrats on a great quarter. Operator : The next question today comes from the line of Ross Fowler from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Ross Fowler : So just a couple for me here. One, the first part is just any commentary on commissioner resignation and time line for replacement cost replacement. And then not to beat the dead horse here, but you came into the year on my quick math is about $75 million of cost contingency to offset the sort of weather normalization you knew you were going to have to deal with? Now Garrick, as you went through those five things, you've priced that up to about $200 million and around numbers. So there's another $125 million or so coming in. And clearly, you thought about wanting that bucket is onetime and what's sort of more permanent. Maybe can you contextualize for us how conversations with the Commission have gone around what onetime cost improvement, what's permitting improvement in the past? And kind of look to the future as to how those negotiations go because clearly, there can be some conversation around that as you look at the cost reduction? Garrick Rochow : Let me start with Germain Phillips. And it was -- I have great respect for Germain. He was a great commissioner, and we saw constructive outcomes. And he left the legacy at the Commission, and I'd put it into three areas. One, he really moved electric vehicles in the state. And it was forward-thinking and progressive about that work. And then in addition to that, there was a lot of work and grid monetization and optimization of the grid that he helped position within the commission. And the third piece, and this is -- have really played out nicely over the course of the pandemic is he was laser-focused on low income and vulnerable customers. And I give him credit as well as the Commission for the work. We have the lowest bad debt levels across the industry. And so we've taken care of our low-income customers during some of the toughest times during this pandemic. And so much of that credit goes to Germain Philips. But I'll also refer you to -- he's got a public statement out there. He's successful, but so is his wife is successful. And his wife has went after new opportunities, and so many thanks, and congratulations to both Germain, his wife and his family as they pursue different career opportunities. This Commission has functioned well in the past with two commissioners. And we've got two constructive, experienced commissioners in place. And so I'm not worried about the interim at all. And if you look historically as well as with this governor, Governor Whitmer here, they've been very thoughtful about the placement of commissioners and found experience and well-suited commissioners to continue the constructive environment, regulatory environment in Michigan. We do know that the governor is out -- the governor's staff is out looking for a new commissioner. That process is underway, but we don't have a deadline or a date out there and when that will take place. But again, I have confidence in our governor to continue the long-standing tradition of this jurisdiction in a constructive jurisdiction. I'm going to pass the call over to Rejji here to talk a little bit about the financial information to your second part of your question. Rejji Hayes : Ross, I appreciate the question. So just one last thing on Germain, and it's a bit of an advertisement for the Michigan legislative and regulatory construct. I mean, part of the reason why it's really wonderful to have staggered terms for your commissioners is because when you do have turnover on an unexpected basis, you still have that continuity of leadership and so we obviously have Chair Scripps and Commissioner Paratek still in the seat. And they obviously have a policy -- or there are philosophies are aligned with the governor's policies, I should say, around healthy climate. And so there's that nice continuity there, and they have a quorum with 2. And so we'll still carry on, and I'm sure they'll find a suitable replacement for Commissioner Phillips when the time is right. With respect to your question around the cost opportunities, let me just be very clear, I'll try to get at the numbers you specified as best I can. And if I miss anything, please feel free to follow up with a question. But if you think about our guidance at the beginning of the year on our Q4 call, we effectively said, as always, we plan for normal weather. And we assume the level of cost productivity in our plan. And so we were showing about $0.04 per share of positive variance related to cost savings. And then we had some estimated opportunities as a result of the warm weather we put to work in 2022 in Q4 specifically with the voluntary refund mechanism and some of the pull aheads and opportunities we exercise in the context of the electric rate case settlement. And so that equated to about $0.19 to $0.25 on of opportunity or positive variance in the original guidance. And so as you fast forward to Q1 and you look at the waterfall we're showing today, what's really changed is that we've now seen $0.21 or just over $80 million pretax in the form of weather hurt and that's what we're offsetting and solving for in the form of cost productivity as well as in that sort of catch-all bucket around parent-related opportunities. And so what we're effectively saying is that $80 million of offsets that we need to go identify and when we look at our track record, and we're not trying to be modest around that, we feel very good about our ability to achieve that. And so when you think about 2020 during the pandemic, we took out $100 million. And when you think about sustainable savings versus one-timers, about 50% of that in 2020 was in the form of the CE Way, and that's what will flow through rates. And that's what customers will benefit from. There are one-timers that sometimes we do have to resurrect some of those old plays. And so those are sort of opportunities that probably don't get incorporated into rates because you need to execute on those in subsequent years. But my working assumption is we'll see probably about a good portion of the opportunities we're trying to execute on and offset this $0.20 or $0.20-plus of weather in the form of CE Way as well as those opportunities Garrick noted earlier in the call. So whether it's hiring freezes, whether it's external hiring type decisions around contractors and consultants, we will take all of those opportunities as part of this portfolio savings to offset that, call it, $80-plus million of weather. So that's how we think about it. That's how we'll go get it. And again, a good portion should be passed on to customers, but some will be onetimers and those are the ones that you don't necessarily repeat. Is that helpful? Ross Fowler : Yes, that's helpful, Rejji. I guess in the past, you've been able to have that discussion with the Commission. It's really onetime and what's permanent. In the context of any debate around that, right? As you look at some of that CE Way money and then some of the sort of hiring freeze stuff. I guess the risk from my perspective is the Commission would say, well, you have a bunch of onetime stuff in there and some of that permanent, can we get some customer bill relief out of that more permanent basis. But maybe contextualize that risk around discussions you've had about that in the past and their understanding of what's onetime and what's not. Rejji Hayes : Yes. To be clear, this is the benefit of filing annual cases because as we realize those savings, which, again, when they're generated the CE Way, they are sustainable, we will pass them on in subsequent cases or as part of the adjudicated process. Because when we file rebuttal, we start to bake in some of those savings midstream. And so there is a pretty transparent dialogue with the commission staff and other interveners about the opportunities we think are sustainable, and that's what we incorporate into our cases. And again, that's the benefit of being an annual filer. Ross Fowler : Fantastic. So I'm with you on the $80 million in cost cuts and then there's like an incremental $50 million between the sort of year-end call back in this deck and that other usage category kind of went through in the answer to Julien's question. Rejji Hayes : Yes. The only other thing I'll mention, just to be clear, there is a bit of geography, you have to be mindful of as well. So when we say parent-related savings, whether they're tax planning or financing efficiency, some of that is at the holding company, in which case, it wouldn't be incorporated into an adjudicated process because they're not at the opco level. So some of those will directly go to shareholders. And so I think that's also very clear to the commission and other stakeholders in the context of a rate case. Operator : There are no additional questions noted at this time. So I'd like to pass the call back over to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Bailey. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. We'll see you on the road soon. Take care, and stay safe. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

The earnings news release was issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. Today's call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time on how to queue-up. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 PM Eastern Time running through August 3. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sri Maddipati : Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We apologize for the delay as we're experiencing technical difficulties. If you have any questions and we're unable to participate on the call, please feel free to give me or Travis Uphaus a call after this earnings call. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Sri. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. CMS Energy, we deliver, we say it and we back it up. So what makes it work for all stakeholders is this investment thesis that we start with in nearly every earnings call. I've reiterated the key points of this thesis on many occasions. Today, I want to draw attention to three key components. First, we continue to make industry-leading progress on the transformation to clean energy. This is required to position the business for the future, and I will share more evidence of our good work this quarter with the exit of our coal units at our current facility and the acquisition of the Covert generating plant. Next, Michigan continues to be a solid place for investment. Our energy legislation is one of the best in the country and we operate in a top-tier regulatory environment, providing important certainty for critical customer investments and there continues to be evidence to support it. I'll share the details on our fourth consecutive settlement in our recent gas rate case. Finally, you'll hear from me on the strong progress we made in cost management, the CE Way, and other countermeasures to offset the unplanned headwinds experienced early in the year. I'm pleased with the progress and remain confident in our plan to deliver 2023 and beyond. Our investment thesis is simple. It's worked for more than 20 years, regardless of conditions, to deliver the operational and financial results across the triple bottom line for all our stakeholders. At CMS Energy, we like to say leaders lead. And we are leading the clean energy transformation. We've set industry-leading, ambitious net-zero targets for both our gas and electric systems, and we continue to get it done. Our actions today serve as proof points that we can and we will achieve our targets. In June, we retired our Karn units one and two, removing 515 megawatts of coal generation from Michigan, further reducing our carbon profile. I'd like to take a moment to recognize the service of the individuals at Karn who dedicated their careers to providing energy for our customers. I had the opportunity to be there in the final days of the facility's operations, and I am proud to share the pride our coworkers have for their work. I'm also proud of the work we have done to provide a just transition, either to retirement or a new place within our company for those who served at this facility. As we transition out of coal, it is imperative that we maintain reliability for our customers in our state. And so in June, we assumed ownership in operations of the Covert generating plant. This existing 1.2 gigawatt facility maintains important low-cost, reliable electric supply in Michigan and further bolsters the MISO footprint. I'm proud to share our industry-leading commitments are being noticed, and we are now included in the MSCI ESG Leaders Index, the only vertically integrated utility to be included in this index. These are proof points, evidence in our leadership of this important transformation across the industry and will help us attract incremental capital to CMS Energy to bolster our customer investments. Adding to the good work of the quarter, we signed more contracts in our Voluntary Green Pricing program, which has now grown to 341 megawatts of owned generation, and I see further growth on the near horizon. We received approval for nearly $11 million in grants for RNG facilities to support farms we partner with as we decarbonize our gas system. And we expect our 201 megawatt Heartland wind farm, which qualifies for a 10.7% ROE, will be operational later this year. While these are just a few highlights, they demonstrate what we do at CMS Energy. We set big goals, we get after it every day and we deliver, leading the clean energy transformation. Turning to Slide 5, I want to take a moment to talk about the constructive regulatory environment in Michigan. Recently, the Governor re-appointed Chair Scripps to a full term ending in 2029, and appointed Alessandra Carreon to fill the remainder of Commissioner Tremaine Phillips' term, which ends in 2025. The appointment of Commissioner Carreon, in continuity in leadership to the re-appointment of Chair Scripps, further reflect the constructive and stable nature of the Michigan regulatory environment, which remains one of the best jurisdictions in the country. We've connected with Commissioner Carreon, and she has a strong background in decarbonization, in transportation electrification, and is well-suited for the role. We look forward to working with her and this Commission. As for the regulatory calendar, our gas rate case settlement is one more in the streak of settlements and our second gas settlement in just over a year. I'm pleased with the outcome and the teams' work. This is a clear demonstration of the constructive regulatory environment in Michigan, and speaks to our ability to work with multiple parties to provide the best outcome for our customers and our investors. We expect rates to go into effect October 1, for the start of the new test year. In our electric rate case, we are waiting staff's position by the end of August and a final order by March of next year. Within our filing, we are requesting approval for a small undergrounding pilot, roughly 10 miles, and plan to underground over 400 miles annually. This is an area where we have a lot of opportunity to strengthen our system and improve reliability and resiliency while aligning with our Midwest peers. Solid energy legislation, strong regulatory construct and the evidence to support it, a top-tier regulatory jurisdiction. Moving on to the financials. For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.75. We had a strong quarter, driven by operational and financial performance, and we continue to build contingency to the CE Way as we deliver on our year-end financial objectives. Today, we are reaffirming all our financial objectives, including our full-year guidance of $3.6 to $3.12 per share, with continued confidence toward the high end. We're also reaffirming our long-term adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% per year, with continued confidence toward the high end and remain committed to annual dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. As I stated in our Q1 call, this is not our first rodeo. The team has done a remarkable job of mitigating the gap left from a warm winter and a large ice storm. Through the CE Way, operational cost measures, financing and other countermeasures, we have made great progress year-to-date. Year-after-year, we deliver. And this year will be no different. This is not about winning one game or one season. It's about winning multiple seasons, a winning program, continuing the long track record of consistent growth and compounding off of actuals, bringing our investors a high quality of earnings and doing year-after-year. Now, I'll hand the call over to Rejji to provide some additional details and insights. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick. And good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter, delivering adjusted earnings of $0.75 per share, driven by numerous cost-reduction initiatives foreshadowed on our Q1 call, which I will elaborate on shortly. Our financial performance over the past few months has materially offset the weather-driven challenges we faced in the first quarter. As such, as Garrick noted, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year. And on a year-to-date basis, we're on track with adjusted EPS of $1.45 per share, given the back-end weighted nature of our plan this year. As you can see in the waterfall chart on Slide 7, weather has been a significant headwind to our financial performance in the first half of this year, driving $0.37 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Rate relief, net of investment-related expenses has resulted in $0.06 per share of positive variance versus the first half of 2022, driven by last year's constructive electric and gas rate case settlements. From a cost perspective, our financial performance in the first half of the year has been significantly impacted by higher operating and maintenance, or O&M, expenses to the tune of $0.15 per share versus the comparable period in 2022, attributable to storm restoration costs in the first quarter. However, it is worth noting that our operational O&M expenses, which represent the majority of our O&M expense and primarily exclude costs associated with our energy waste reduction programs and employee benefits, have trended favorably during the second quarter and we're down roughly 10% versus the second quarter of 2022. So we're seeing the fruits of the numerous operational cost-reduction initiatives we put in place earlier in the year, such as reducing our use of consultants and contractors, limiting hiring, accelerating longer-term IT cost-reduction initiatives, and eliminating other discretionary spending. And of course, leveraging the CE Way, our lean operating system. We anticipate that our strong cost performance will continue as we move through the second half of the year. Rounding out the first six months of the year, you'll note the $0.18 per share of positive variance versus the first half of 2022, highlighted in the catch-all bucket in the middle of the chart. The primary source of upside here was related to financing efficiencies. In short, we capitalize on attractive conditions in the convertible bond market by pricing an $800 million issuance and using the majority of the proceeds to pre-fund future parent company financing needs. Usually, pre-fundings like this are subject to negative carry. However, given the current inverted yield curve, we've managed to reinvest the proceeds at deposit rates favorable to the underlying funding cost. Lastly, we used the balance of the proceeds from the convert offering to tender a portion of select bonds well below par, which has de-levered our balance sheet. All in, this opportunistic financing transaction was earnings accretive and has further strengthened our liquidity position. Looking ahead. As always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.06 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Due to the absence of strong sales of the electric utility driven by last year's warm summer, we anticipate that the estimated negative variance attributable to weather will be more than offset by rate relief, net of investment-related cost, which we have quantified at $0.08 per share versus the first half of 2022. Our estimates reflect the terms of our recently filed gas rate case settlement agreement, which is subject to Commission approval, and the residual benefits of our 2022 electric rate case settlement. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year. As noted during our Q1 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense of the utility driven by the ongoing benefits of the aforementioned cost-reduction initiatives, some expected favorable year-over-year variance related to service restoration costs, and the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way, which collectively equates to $0.26 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Lastly, as we discussed during our first quarter call, we're assuming modest growth at NorthStar and the benefits associated with the roughly $0.12 per share, a pull-ahead exercise in the fourth quarter of 2022. As per our original guidance, all in, we estimate these items will drive $0.17 to $0.23 per share positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. In summary, we've made great progress to offset the challenging weather experienced in the first quarter, but needless to say, we'll continue to plan conservatively and execute as we always do. Moving on to the balance sheet on Slide 8, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from Moody's. As you know, we continue to target mid-teens FFO-to-debt over our planning period. As always, we remain focused on maintaining a strong financial position, which coupled with a supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating cash flow growth, supports our solid investment-grade ratings to the benefit of customers and investors. Moving on to the financing plan. Slide 9 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2023, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility. This includes both first mortgage bond financings and a securitization financing to address the recovery of the undepreciated rate base at the recently retired Karn coal facilities. As for the parent company, given the timing of the convertible bond issuance, we've been able to delay the settlement of the equity forwards that priced last year, so the roughly $440 million of forward equity contracts will be settled commensurate with the needs of the business over time. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true, year in and year out, and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances, to the benefit of our customers and investors. And this year is no different. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Rejji. Our track record spans two decades and consistently delivers industry-leading results in any conditions. This is what we do. We deliver for all stakeholders, year in and year out, and this year will be no different. With that, Michelle, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you very much, Garrick. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Garrick Rochow : Hi, good morning, Jeremy. How are you? Rejji Hayes : Morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Good, good, thanks. Maybe just wanted to start off with the undergrounding pilot, if we could, and just wondering if you could expand a bit more I guess on what would define success there or I guess future outlook for how quickly that could fold into the plan in larger size over time. Garrick Rochow : So I've got an interesting story on this, Jeremy. I was out with our crews here about two weeks ago and we had an undergrounding in a - replacement undergrounding in a subdivision area. So remember, in Michigan, subdivisions are underground. A lot of people request their service underground. And so we know how to do this work. And in fact, we have a large gas business that does a lot of undergrounding, and so we're sharing practices back and forth. And so, again, right now, we're starting out with the pilot. And that's just a nice way to step into this with the Public Service Commission to show them our capabilities in being able to deliver that at a low cost for our customers. Again, as I've shared in past calls, the cost for undergrounding in Michigan, given the soil, given where we intend to put the undergrounding, it's really conducive and it's really almost at parity with above-ground construction. So it makes it really affordable for our customers. And so we intend to use that practice, it's recognized through EPRI as a best practice; not everywhere, but strategically or selectively across our system. And so starts with 10 miles. We've got six counties identified. We've got projects starting up in one of the North of Grand Rapids area here in about two weeks. The Public Service Commission will be on that site as well to watch that, observe that. And what we intend to grow that is about 400 miles annually. As I've shared in the past, about 10% to 15% of our system is undergrounded. Other Midwest peers, around 35% to 40%. So again, it's best practice, and we see it as a way to improve reliability and resiliency for the future. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful, thank you for that. And storms have been topical in Michigan, obviously, in recent time here. And just wondering if you could provide a bit more color, I guess, on your efforts, hardening efforts and where you stand, where do you want to be to improve resiliency there, and just kind of how you feel local stakeholders are aligned against those - against this outlook in the state. Garrick Rochow : As I shared in the Q1 call, our focus is clearly on reliability and resiliency coming off of the large ice storm. We are making a lot of investments, considerable investments across the electric system. And we've seen good performance here over the course of the summer. Even just the last night, we had 65-mile winds come through and the system performed well with about 20,000 customers out this morning and we're quickly restoring them. And so the investments we're making - it's a large system, but the investments we're making are certainly showing benefit. So we've got a great plan. We're filing that plan here in September with the five-year - with our five-year infrastructure plan. This audit that's underway that will start here in September will be another point of alignment for the right investments across the electric system to improve reliability and resiliency. So those things are going well and our system is performing well. And so I feel good about our performance this summer, and we'll continue to be focused on it. Jeremy Tonet : Got it, that's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America. Please go ahead. Heidi Hauch : Hi, good morning. This is Heidi Hauch on for Julien. Thank you for taking my question. Garrick Rochow : Hi, Heidi. Rejji Hayes : Morning. Heidi Hauch : Hi. Just first question, noting your plans to file another IRP in the next year or two, do you see any read-throughs for your next IRP related to the latest peer IRP settlement approved by the Michigan PSC, either from the coal retirement front, renewables investments or otherwise? Thank you. Garrick Rochow : Well, first, I want to congratulate that peer utility that had an IRP settled this week. So congratulations to the DTE team. A lot goes into those IRPs. And if you take one thing away from that IRP, it just speaks to the constructive environment here in Michigan. Four settlements for us, a settlement in IRP for DTE. That's really good. So we'll obviously look at their IRP and look at what we want to take into our next IRP. The other things that we'll consider, the Inflation Reduction Act has certainly changed PTCs and ITCs and is shaping the industry investment. Infrastructure and Jobs Act is also shaking up some things in our industry. And so all that will go into our next IRP and into some of our thinking. The IRP process takes about 12 months to 18 months to build really a thoughtful and thorough plan that we would submit to the Commission. I anticipate we'll start that process in 2024, building out that. So if you played it out, that means we file maybe late 2025/2026 timeframe. And so there's still some work to define that and tie that down, but that's our early indications of how we think about our next IRP. Heidi Hauch : Great, thank you. And then a second question from me, can you comment on the latest MPSC investigation into the natural gas meters and new service delays? How are you planning to address or improve these issues, and are there any potential capital opportunities that may result from this investigation? Thank you. Garrick Rochow : Thank you for your question. It probably goes without saying this, but I'll say it anyways. We take every MPSC inquiry seriously. And from a customer perspective and bills, we got to get that right. But maybe a little background here, Heidi. Our meters communicate wirelessly. That's our Smart Grid. It's all wireless. And obviously, there's a wireless carrier that communicates that signal back to our home offices here. And as you might imagine, those wireless carriers are moving from 3G to 5G. So they're shutting down some of the 3G systems and moving to 5G. And they made us aware of that, and we were working with our meter vendor to upgrade those meters so they had the right communication components to operate at 4G and 5G technology. That process was underway. However, the meter vendor ran into supply chain problems, in part due to the pandemic, where they couldn't get the components for the meter. That delayed our deployment of these meters. And so when we walked in, in January of 2023, we had about 190,000 meters that were no longer communicating. Today that's around 33,000, and we continue to work with our meter vendor to close that and we expect that to be closed by August. As you can imagine, when those meters aren't communicating, it creates the potential for estimated reads. Our meter vendor was supposed to go out and read meters for us to close that gap. They did not meet our expectations around that and we had to step in and close that gap, which we've done and our reads are being completed and any consecutive estimates are now within historical parameters. And so from a meter perspective, from a consecutive estimate perspective, those are resolved or will be resolved in August. We owe a report to the Commission on August 4, and so we'll do that. From a materiality perspective, we've factored that in, both the reading in the meters and any penalties we may see from the Public Service Commission, and they're incorporated within our guidance that we've offered. I do not see a capital opportunity here. But rest assured that from a customer perspective and MPSC perspective, we are running this to ground, we're doing a root cause on it, make sure that it will not happen again for our customers. Thanks for your question, Heidi. Heidi Hauch : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Sullivan at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Michael Sullivan : Hi, everyone, good morning. Can you hear me okay? Garrick Rochow : We can. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, Mike. Rejji Hayes : Yes, okay. Great. Hi, Garrick. Maybe this one is for Rejji. Just wanted to ask on the delay in the draw on the forward equity and just how we should think about timing there, whether that ends up getting needed at all. I think my recollection is outside of that, you had no other needs until 2025, but maybe just a little more color on what the equity picture looks like going forward, now that you've done the convert. Rejji Hayes : Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. Yes, we will still plan to settle the equity. It will likely be, I'll say the back half of this year and deep into the second half, so call it late Q3 or in Q4. But we do still plan to settle the equity over the course of this year. Michael Sullivan : Okay, great. And just in terms of the impact on metrics and FFO-to-debt from the convert issuance and tender and delay in equities, does that kind of move you at all up or down to within your mid-teens target? Rejji Hayes : No, the convert transaction was for all intents and purposes, when you take into account all the puts and takes, is effectively credit-neutral, maybe modestly accretive. And then the delay of the equity settle, again it's still going to take place over the course of this year, so again, all credit-neutral. And so we'll still be right in that mid-teens area and well in alignment with the expectations of the credit rating agencies so we can maintain our investment-grade ratings. Michael Sullivan : Okay, great, thank you very much. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions from the phone lines, so I will turn the conference back to you, Garrick Rochow, for any closing remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Michelle. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. We'll see you on the road too. Take care and stay safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference call for this morning. We would like to thank you all for participating and ask you to please disconnect your lines.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 P.M. Eastern Time running through November 2. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Sri Maddipati : Thank you, Harry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Sri and thank you everyone for joining us today. What sets us apart in this industry is clear and it's been proven for over two decades are simple cleaner and leaner investment thesis. We've talked about this in many calls in many investor meetings and it works a long and robust capital runway, a best-in-class ability to take cost out of the business, to create headroom for needed investments and keep bills affordable for customers. Couple that with a constructive top-tier regulatory environment and that is our recipe for premium total shareholder return. Today I want to highlight one part of our investment thesis, infrastructure renewal. It starts with our five-year $15.5 billion capital plan which supports a long runway for important customer investments. This allows us to do what is most important for our customers deliver safe, reliable, affordable energy and lead the industry in the clean energy transformation. We are one of the first vertically integrated utilities to switch from coal to clean by 2025 leading the industry with net zero carbon by 2040 aligned with customers, policymakers and our strategic plan positioning us for the future. In our gas business, we are on pace to net zero methane by 2030 and with a 20% reduction in Scope 3 emissions one of the few in the industry making the gas system safer and cleaner. And in our electric distribution system, we are hardening the grid to make it more reliable today while preparing for the resiliency that will be required for EVs, connected devices and to mitigate impact of climate change. Our electric distribution system is vast covering much of the lower Peninsula of Michigan, but it's aging. We are seeing more frequent and severe weather which proves the future or require something different because our customers count on us for reliable service. Last month we filed our electric reliability road map with the Michigan Public Service Commission, which outlined our plan to improve reliability and prepare the system for greater resiliency. Over the last 20 years, we've seen an increase in both the frequency of storms and higher wind speed with some of the most extreme wins within the last four years. We're clearly seeing the effects of climate change. Given this in the increasing dependency on the electric distribution system, we have set forward a plan that bolsters the system now and builds for the future. We worked with the leading industry research institute EPRI benchmarking companies as well as advancing technology to build a robust and comprehensive plan. This five-year electric reliability road map calls for $7 billion of capital investment to harden the system, expand undergrounding, update infrastructure, increase capacity and advanced automation. To give you a small snapshot, our plan includes roughly 1,000 miles of system undergrounding in the near-term and longer term significantly more undergrounding to ensure our system is prepared to withstand severe weather. Originally our design standard was for 40-mile per hour wind. With the wind speeds we are seeing today, our new standard is for 80-mile per hour wind and 0.5 inch of ice loading. This plan also includes further automation in machine modeling adding technology to more precisely locate and isolate damage, reroute power and better predict problem areas keeping more customers online in responding to outages faster. We put our stake in the ground. We've identified the steps to improve reliability a step change and build an electric grid that can better withstand extreme weather and better serve our customers in the future. With commission support this plan will reduce the frequency and duration of outages while moving us into second quartile for reliability coupled with additional customer investments the longer-term vision delivers a grid or no outage will affect more than 100,000 customers and no customer will be without power for more than 24 hours. We expect these investments to be part of our upcoming electric rate case filings and will be implemented upon commission approval. And let me be clear, we are already making progress. We've doubled our investment in vegetation management over the last three years shortening our trim cycles. We've seen greater than 60% benefit where we've done the work. We've increased the amount of customer investments and upgrades using in hardening installing nearly 15,000 used devices in the last two years more than we've ever done reducing the number of customers impacted for interruption. We've increased our maintenance inspection frequency mining potential failures before they occur. And just last week we were notified that of the nearly 300 companies who applied for grants on the Department of Energy, we were one of seven companies who were awarded $100 million for specializing and improving circuit in disadvantaged communities. This is great for our company and our customers. First it accelerates investment, which were already part of our $7 billion electric reliability road map; second this strikes the important balance of reliability improvement and affordability; and finally because these are matching grant that provides greater line of sight and certainty recovery of these needed customer investments. We take our commitment to serve seriously what our customers deserve. We wake up every day to deliver. That's why we constructed our electric reliability road map. On Slide 5 I want to take a moment to provide an update on our regulatory calendar. In September, we revised our position in our electric rate case to $169 million and maintained our position for a 10.25% ROE and a 51.5% equity ratio. We're requesting approval of a 10-mile undergrounding pilot with plans to underground over 400 miles annually beginning in 2027, which aligns with our electric reliability road map, a small but important step in building out a program that can be supported by the Michigan Public Service Commission and will deliver significant improvement for our customers. We also requested a recovery mechanism for investments in our electric distribution system to improve reliability. Similar to the mechanism we've utilized in our gas business, which creates greater clarity on the investment end customer benefit while improving certainty of recovery. We expect the final order by March of next year. We also recently received approval from the Michigan Public Service Commission on our gas rate case settlement providing continued value for our customers and investors. These rates became effective October 1. We plan to follow our next gas rate case in December of this year. This case brings a continued focus on a safe, reliable, affordable and clean natural gas system will support needed customer investment. As we've shared in previous calls and in investor meetings, we continue to see the Michigan regulatory jurisdiction as constructive in providing a good balance for all stakeholders leading up to its ranking as top tier. Moving on to the financials. For the third quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 and $2.06 per share year-to-date. Rejji will provide additional details but despite a significant storm in the third quarter, we remain on track to deliver on our full year guidance of $3.06 to $3.12 per share and expect to deliver toward the high end. Given that confidence, we are initiating our full year guidance for 2024 at $3.27 to $3.33 per share reflecting 6% to 8% growth off the midpoint of this year's range and we are well positioned just like 2023 to be toward the high end of that range. It is also important to remember that we always rebased guidance off our actuals on the Q4 call impounding our growth. This brings you a higher quality of earnings and differentiates us from others in the sector. We're also reaffirming our long-term adjusted earnings growth of 6% to 8% per year with continued confidence toward the high end and remain committed to dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. Like we've done in previous years we'll provide you with an update on our 2024 guidance based off of actuals, as well as a refresh of our 5-year capital plan on the Q4 call. We continue to be confident in our ability to deliver the year and in our longer-term outlook providing exceptional value for all stakeholders. With that I'll hand it over to Rejji to offer some additional details. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick and good morning, everyone. As Garrick noted, we had a solid third quarter, delivering adjusted earnings of $0.61 per share, driven by numerous cost reduction initiatives which have largely offset the headwinds that we have faced throughout the year most recently in the form of a severe storm that hit our electric service territory in August. To put the weather we have experienced in 2023 into perspective, we are approaching a record level of storm activity this year, which further supports the needed investments in our electric system that Garrick highlighted, and we have seen heating and cooling degree days of 11% and 24% below historical levels respectively on a year-to-date basis. That said, we do not make excuses and have implemented numerous countermeasures throughout the year to mitigate these risks and are well positioned to deliver on our financial objectives this year, the benefit of customers and investors. As such, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year and on a year-to-date basis, we're on track with adjusted EPS of $2.06 per share given our progress in the aforementioned countermeasures which I'll elaborate on shortly. In the waterfall chart on Slide 7, for clarification purposes all of the variance analysis therein are measured relative to the comparable periods in 2022. The actuals are quantified on a year-to-date basis and the prospective period reflects the final three months of the year. Starting with actuals with respect to weather. The previously noted unfavorable weather experience in 2023 has driven $0.49 per share of negative go. Rate relief, net of investment-related expenses has resulted in $0.20 per share of positive variance, driven by last year's constructive electric and gas rate case settlements. From a cost perspective, our financial performance through the third quarter has been significantly impacted by higher operating and maintenance or O&M expenses to the tune of $0.21 per share of negative variance due to higher service restoration expenses attributable to storms. However, it is worth noting that our operational O&M expenses exclusive of service restoration expense are down roughly 10% versus the third quarter of 2022, which highlights the significant cost performance we've realized across the business. To that end and as previously noted, we implemented numerous cost reduction initiatives early in the year, such as reducing our use of consultants and contractors, limiting hiring, accelerating longer-term IT projects and eliminating other discretionary spending. We have also supplemented these efforts with a voluntary separation program or VSP that reduced our salaried workforce by roughly 10%. And more importantly, as we leverage the CE Way our lean operating system, we will continue to eliminate waste and increase productivity going forward. Rounding out the first nine months of the year, you'll note that $0.27 per share of positive variance highlighted the catch-all bucket in the middle of the chart. We've seen this bar increase throughout the year, as a result of our continued success in realizing cost savings through financing efficiencies, liability management, strong tax planning and favorable non-weather sales in our electric business during the summer. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, as always we plan for normal weather, which we expect will have a neutral impact on our financial performance versus the fourth quarter of 2022. And we expect a similar financial impact for rate relief net of investment-related costs as the benefits of our recent gas rate case settlement and our 2022 electric rate case settlement are largely offset by the absence tax benefits associated with the prior gas rate case settlement. From a cost perspective as noted during our Q2 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense at the utility, driven by the ongoing benefit cost reduction initiatives, which equates to $0.17 per share of targeted variance. It is also worth noting that the Q4 2022 comp for this bucket is notably soft given the higher-than-average O&M expenses incurred during that period. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, you'll note in the penultimate that yellow bar on the right that we're anticipating $0.23 to $0.29 per share a positive variance. As we've discussed previously, the key drivers here are the absence of significant discretionary actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to last year's electric rate case settlement and the filing of our voluntary refund mechanism which collectively equate to $0.12 per share. The remaining notable items that we anticipate in this bucket are from North Star our non-utility business achieving its full year guidance and favorable non-weather sales at the utility, which have trended well over the past few quarters. All in, we remain confident in our ability to meet our EPS guidance for the year. And as always we'll take none of this positive momentum for granted and will approach these last two months of the year with the usual degree of paranoia by maintaining our cost discipline and flex additional opportunities as needed to deliver the consistent financial results you have come to expect. Moving on to the balance sheet. On Slide 8, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from S&P in August. As you know, we continue to target mid-teens FFO to debt on a consolidated basis over our planning period to preserve our solid investment-grade credit ratings. Our financing strategy and strong balance sheet position us well given the market volatility we've seen recently. At the utility, our annual rate case cadence and the use of forward-looking test years allow us to incorporate higher interest rates into our filings and recover the associated costs with minimal lag. At the parent where funding costs are non-recoverable, we have limited refinancing risk in the near term with $250 million due in 2024 and 2025 and $300 million coming due in 2026. And as noted during our second quarter call, the 2024 maturity has already been prefunded with proceeds from our convertible debt issuance in May. It is also worth noting that 100% of the debt of the parent companies fixed is over 40% is hybrid in nature thus receiving equity credit from the rating agencies. In addition to strong liability management, we have continued to plan conservatively. And debt funding costs have increased in the current environment they remain consistent with the assumptions embedded in our long-term financial plan. As always, we remain focused on maintaining a strong financial position which coupled with a supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating cash flow generation supports our solid investment-grade ratings for the benefit of our customers and investors. Moving on to the financing plan. Slide 9 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2023. In short, I'm pleased to report that our financing plan for the year is largely completed. In fact at the utility, we've completed all of our planned first mortgage bond issuances for the year at a weighted average coupon of approximately 4.8%, which is below our planned estimate. The only remaining opco financing is a securitization funding to address the recovery of the undepreciated rate base in our recently retired coal facilities. As for the parent company given the timing of the aforementioned convertible bond issuance, we've been able to delay the settlement of the equity forwards at price last year. So the roughly $440 million of forward equity contracts will be settled in the fourth quarter. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives irrespective of the circumstances to the benefit of customers and investments. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks and for the Q&A session. Garrick Rochow : Thank you Rejji. You hear us say it every year. We deliver. Our track record spans two decades of consistently delivering industry-leading results in all conditions for all stakeholders. This year be no different. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thanks very much, Garrick. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Jeremy, your line is open. Jeremy Tonet : Good morning. Garrick Rochow : Hey, Jeremy, how are you? Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : Good. Good. Thanks. Just wanted to start with the electric rate case if I could here. Thank you for the color that you provided but I wonder if we could dig in a little bit more on how recent conversations have been tracking in the case. Could you walk us through the core differences between DAS recommendation and your proposal? What items should we be looking for more specifically is that impossible when tracking mechanisms are disputed? And is a fully litigated case preferable in this area so there's no kind of gray areas? Garrick Rochow : Great question, Jeremy. I feel good about the progress of our electric rate case. And just to give you a little flavor on where we're at with that. In rebuttal we came back at $169 million. And as I shared in my prepared remarks 10.25% ROE and 51.5% equity ratio. And that reflects just the differences in the business from when we built the case to where we're at now in the forward-looking test year. Staff is at $88 million. And so the gap is pretty small between our ask and where the staff is which again I see is very constructive. And so we're really at a constructive starting point in the conversation. And much of that delta is made up with -- it's just really the cost of capital ROE and equity ratio. That's a big piece of the difference. And there's a few other what I call cats and dogs, important cash is the dog nonetheless but things that we are helpful for our customers. And so that's the big difference. Now let's talk a little bit about settlement in the context of settlement. And I've certainly been in a number of these calls where I'm open to settlement and settlement presents itself that's great. And we're certainly receptive to that. But as you pointed out there is an important mechanism in there and there's undergrounding. Those are two key things that we need to see come out of this case. Investment recovery mechanism to have some certainty on our distribution, let distribution investments in this underground pilot. This is important to get started, and there's a real benefit for our customers. And so those are harder to get in settlement just to be fully transparent. Typically, they're a black box when you go through settlement. And so we're prepared to go to the full distance. And I'll just be honest with the entire call it's likely we're going to go the full distance and I have confidence that we can get a really constructive outcome going to a full order. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful there. And maybe pivoting a bit could you walk us through your longer-term expectations for DIG particularly as it relates to recontracting here? Could you speak to the longer-term potential for this business and for non-regulated renewables growth in the future as well given the changing landscape? Garrick Rochow : Yes. Our non-utility growth continues to be small in the bigger scheme of things. Our primary business continues to be the utility space. So it's about a 95,5 [ph] mix. And as shared in the prepared remarks we expect them to be within guidance range. And so that's a good piece. It continues to be contracted renewables. And again Rejji uses these words singles and doubles. We're not swinging for the fences here. So just thoughtful contracted renewables. They have a utility-like return, long-term contracts assuming no terminal value again really conservative almost utility-like. And then there's the Dearborn Industrial Generation or DIG. And we continue to see upward pressure on energy and capacity prices. And so we're fully contracted out to 2025, with energy and capacity. And so we're filling in 2026 2027 in the out years. We plan conservatively, but those bilaterals and the contracts that we are inking are certainly better than expectations. Now don't read into that a sugar high. You've heard me say no sugar highs in the past. So you can anticipate 6% to 8% growth, on this again expectation toward the high side of that growth. And so we'll continue to reinvest as needed versus the sugar high. So hopefully, that's helpful as we see North Star Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Understood. No sugar highs, but certainly helpful towards the upper end of the range there. So thank you for the color, will leave it there. Thanks. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien, your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning, team. How you guys doings. Garrick Rochow : Hey, Julien. Rejji Hayes : Good morning. Julien Congratulations on the announcement there and good work on your team. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I appreciate it. Look just following up on the -- speaking of good work the distribution plan right the $7 billion that you guys talked about there. Can you elaborate just if you think that that's really kind of incremental versus your prior plan? It seems like that's probably kind of a net $1 billion increase over five years. Can you talk about is that incremental, or as you talk about sugar highs is that going to like offset capital elsewhere, if you will to smooth things out? Just curious on how you think about that fitting into the grander plan as you update that more holistically? Garrick Rochow : I'm really excited about this plan. We've talked about -- we've seen the storms this year and certainly we have an opportunity to improve reliability, in the here and now and then prepare for the an aging system a system that's seen higher wins and more severe weather and preparing for the future. So, the team has really done a nice job of putting a good plan together. Now when I look at the five years, it's more than an incremental $1 billion. It's an incremental $3 billion, right? What's right in the plan right now is $4 billion, in our five-year plan. Now I want to be really careful and really clear about this. And so when we get to the Q4 call, we're going to grow our capital. You can expect we're going to grow our capital. You can expect with these needs on the distribution system that it's going to be biased or it's going to be more growth in the on the electric distribution system. So that $4 billion number should grow. That's what I would anticipate and expect. However, I wouldn't just do the simple math of taking 15.5 and adding $3 billion to it. And that would get you the wrong answer to the wrong number. It's important that we get commission support. And as we go through the steps, we'll get that in the rate case filing and we'll weave that in to that capital plan over time. But it should give you a picture of the strength of our five-year plan. It is robust. There's plenty of opportunities out there and that extends even beyond 10 years into a really nice long capital runway. Its helpful Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. Thank you for giving all the context there. In fact speaking of context capacity markets writ large have attracted a decent amount of tension of late and certainly some of the inflationary dynamics around them. Can you speak a little bit to the status of DIG both your contracting status through the long term and more importantly, how you think about your commercial strategy here with pricing as elevated as it seems to be getting in some of these markets. So just curious, on what you guys are seeing and what the opportunity is and how that fits into the plan. Garrick Rochow : Yes. And similar to my previous answer here on this that Dearborn Industrial generation we take a very conservative utility-like approach. And as you know over time we've just stacked in contracts for energy and capacity bilateral contracts to make sure that we are avoiding risk and market volatility. But we certainly, see some upward pressure on both energy and capacity prices as you noted. And so much of the energy and capacity is already -- contracts are already in place through 2025. but we're filling in the gaps at 2026 2027 and out years. We plan conservatively and those contracts are I would say, exceeding our expectations or exceeding our plan, which is great. And so we'll continue to operate just as we have historically in a really conservative mode and a conservative plan, but you can see we're layering in the future right now and feel good about the opportunities for growth at DIG. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And then just quickly if you don't mind, the status of the solar projects just where that stands and the schedule for bringing those into rates. Sorry, just to clarify that. I just wanted to hit that as a last quick one. Garrick Rochow : We feel good about our renewable build. And in this electric rate case, we pulled out some of the renewable build. But I'll be honest with you, 25 years in this business been in engineering operations much of my career. There's projects and contracts that move between years. That's not a big deal. And much of our build this year is in wind. We're going to be COD here end of the year at our Heartland wind farm. We're building another 201 megawatts of wind. And so there's a lot of renewable build that's underway in these years. And so those projects that were referenced in the electric rate case were some of the ones that early got caught up in some of the ops and solar complaint-related issues. We've talked about that that's been hashed through in this industry. I felt good about the projects we have in mid-development right now. We have line of sight into panels. We got good sighting pieces. And so that will play out as part of our IRP build. The other thing is, these all projects don't go away. Remember that, these are part of the IRP. And so they'll get constructed here. It's just a matter of timing and that timing is being refined here. And I think at least one of them is going to go this year anyway so we're going to see some construction there. And remember, because they're approved in the IRP they get AFUDC along the way. So there's no earnings impact. Make sense? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good luck, guys. Thank you so much. Garrick Rochow : Yeah. Thanks, Julien. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim. Shahriar, your line is now open. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Good morning. As we reflect on your kind of prior guidance for $350 million of equity starting in 2025 does kind of that increased CapEx plan move your equity needs proportionately higher. Rejji Hayes : Shar this is Rejji. Yeah, so we're still in the relatively early stage of building out -- sorry Shar? Shar, this is Rejji if you can hear me. So we're in the early stages of rolling out our five-year plan. So we're still calibrating where -- what the financing needs will be. As I've said before, the estimate that we have in our current five-year plan, where we said up to $350 million a year of equity starting in 2025. I don't see that number materially changing. Now, as the CapEx plan increases again we always recalibrate you may see a slight shift upward but we -- we have to take a look at all of the puts and takes the capital investments the cash flow generation. And I think at the end of the day you're not going to see us with any sort of need to do block equity. I still think even without seeing the numbers we'll be able to double out the equity in those outer years. But again, still early days on those calculations. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then just from a stakeholder perspective where is the MPSC going with sort of the investigations into storms at this point? And I guess, what's the range of outcomes you guys anticipate and we've seen some comments filed but there seems to be a negatively skewed mechanism for penalties versus rewards Garrick Rochow : So there's two pieces. And I wouldn't put a negative take on it. All the conversations we have with staff and commissioners continue to be constructive and frankly we're both aligned in the same thing. We want to improve reliability. We have a longer-term view of resiliency. And when we're aligned it makes for constructive conversations. But there's two pieces that I'm hearing in your question Shar. There's one there's the audit that's underway. That was started in September. Liberty Consulting Group is the one doing the work. They've participated with other utilities very skilled organization. Right now they're in the data collection phase that's well underway. We expect an interim report about the end of the year and then a full report likely in the September-ish time frame. It's not about a year report then. But I would just be fully transparent with you and honest I want reliability to improve in the state. I want resiliency and improvement in the state for our customers. And so if they have findings on how we can do work better, my gosh, I'm just going to agree to them. Like we should build that into the next electric grid case. We should do that because we want it better for our customers. And so it doesn't bother me at all. I think this is good that we have an outside party looking and looking at how we can improve. It's only going to add to our reliability road map. And the other thing is on this performance-based rates or PBR, the work group is underway. It was initiated in the first second quarter time frame April-ish time frame I believe. And so that conversation is underway, proposal was put out. We have put comments through that process. We're continuing to participate in work groups. At the end of the day I think you're going to have a nice balance of incentives disincentives from an electric reliability perspective. But the important piece for us is making sure there's a nice line of sight into capital and the capital recovery and there's certainty. That's why we're so focused on this investment recovery mechanism. We also think the same thing is required for storm and some of the O&M expense that occurs in the year. As long as we can navigate all that and get to that point I feel good I feel good. This will lead to good outcomes for our customers. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. Thanks, Garrick. Appreciate it. Thanks, Rejji. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Andrew Weisel of Scotiabank. Andrew, your line is open. Andrew Weisel : Hey, good morning, everybody. Garrick Rochow : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : My first question is about supply chain. I know solar has been in focus. I think you just alluded to that a moment ago but how about the availability of grid level equipment like transformers or switch gears? And if you do see shortages is there a risk that might slow down your planned pace of spending? Garrick Rochow : Well, first of all, I appreciate your analysis. You did a nice write-up on that. It was about a week ago, two weeks ago. So some good work of what's going on in the industry. And so we're highly focused on the supply chain. I'll give it over here to Rejji a minute. He has responsibility for that area. They've done a lot of good work to be able to secure that line of sight. And so when I think about the projects we have underway, particularly those that are in mid-development. The team has done a much better job to make sure we have panels, transformers and the like so we can do that build. Now, there's longer lead times, most definitely. And so you've got to be prepared and you've got to be planned in that but the team has just done a phenomenal job. But Rejji, your team is doing great work, maybe add to it. Rejji Hayes : Yes. Thanks, Garrick. And I appreciate the question Andrew. So Garrick is exactly right. We have really been attacking challenges in supply chain for the last 18 months or so. And what we've done to really make sure that we've got sufficient supply, not just on the solar side but really across the business is we've been very focused on diversifying our vendor sources. And so that has been a very concerted effort again over the last 12 to 18 months. We've also done what we would describe as value engineering and looking at other alternatives, particularly in the context of transformers that could be compatible with our electric grid. So we historically used a standard of grain-oriented steel. We're now using amorphous core and introducing that into our system. We've also been very successful in refurbishing damage transformers and using a variety of third parties to help us with that. And so all of those countermeasures, have really led to us getting to a sufficient level of supply across our most highly used transformers. Now, there's still issues in the supply chain across a variety of materials and we're spending a lot of time on hypercare. But for those highest velocity materials, we feel like we're in really good shape at this point. So I really appreciate the question. Garrick Rochow : I just got to know something. Just a Rejji's dexterity great CFO, and when you can talk about amorphous core, that's really awesome to see. Andrew Weisel : One other question for the team here. Can you give us any updates on the legislative environment in Michigan, talking about the fact that Democrats have full control? So is there any talk of potential updates either a big change to the 2016 law or maybe more likely incremental marginal support for clean energy. Are you hearing any potential around that? Garrick Rochow : So I'll start with the big picture and the Governor's first term, she came out with her healthy climate plan. And that was a nice plan, supportive of the plan very pragmatic and balances clean energy, reliability of supply and affordability. And the Governor came out in August and said -- now in her second term and came out and said, hey, I want to make a portion of this into law. And that's been in the Senate right now. It started out in committee. And so there are a number of bills that were put together on that as you imagine in Committee there's a discussion and we're actively engaged in that discussion. And so that's moved on now to the full Senate for consideration still has not made it to the House. And so there's important work going on to define what that looks like. But I'll just, again, stand back and look at the bigger picture of this, much like 2008, much like 2016, this legislative body as well as the Public Service Commission continues to provide a constructive approach to the future. And we see a constructive out of these bills, if they even move forward and if they even get agreement we see a path of constructive regulation going forward and a constructive policy going forward. And so -- but that's currently where it stands, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Okay. We\u2019ll stay tune. Thank you very much. Garrick Rochow : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Durgesh, please go ahead. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Durgesh. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, team. Thanks. Good morning, Garrick. Thanks for taking my question. I had a few questions. You've already answered them. Just -- maybe just on the O&M savings. Obviously, you've done a great job here offsetting weather and storms, it's a big number like $0.60 $0.70 year-to-date combined impact from weather and storms. What -- like is there a way for you to quantify for us what these O&M savings that you're using? You're offsetting weather and storms with this year. How much of that can be carried forward to 2024 and beyond? I'm just looking for what level of these savings are sustainable, or are these truly one-time in nature? Rejji Hayes : Yes. Durgesh, this is Rejji. I appreciate the question. And I appreciate also the compliments. We are really proud of the work done for the first three quarters of the year offsetting the headwinds we've seen on the weather side both in terms of mild weather as well as the storm activity and the organization has really rallied around the cause. Obviously, when it comes to cost savings, we never discriminate when it comes to operational versus non-operational and we've been quite expansive in our approach. To get to the spirit of your question, I think it's difficult to quantify to what degree the savings will be sustainable. And I do think a decent portion will be because when you think about the separation plan that I mentioned we reduced our salaried workforce by roughly 10% and we do not assume that we will go and re-staff that over the next year or two or even next several years. And so, we'll see sustainable savings from that and that will be a significant portion. Some of the other bigger opportunities. So in Q2 the tender financing obviously that is a one-timer and so we wouldn't count on that being sustained. But there are other opportunities we've executed on. We've been really disciplined and rationalizing our contractor base and some of the consultants we're working with again, we'd like to think we can sustain that. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we accelerated some longer-term IT projects and we think we'll see productivity from those actions for some time now. So I'd say it's tough to really ascribe a specific percentage, but I'd say decent portion should be sustained going into next year and will provide some tailwinds when you think about not just our guidance next year but also affordability because we always look forward to passing on those savings on the customers. And the last thing I'll note is on the financing side, we've seen quite a few efficiencies with the convert where we pulled ahead some costs that we were going to have or some financing needs we had in 2024. That's going to have a sustained level of savings and the operating company financings we've done those in a really efficient fashion at a weighted average coupon of 4.8% below plan. And so we'll see sustained savings from that. So I'd say on the operational and non-operational side you've got some one-timers and then some of that will be sustained but I can't give you a specific percentage at this point. Durgesh Chopra : That\u2019s very helpful color, Rejji. I appreciate it. And then maybe one just quick clarification on the financing point, I'm not trying to jump that down here but you mentioned you're going to update us on the Q4 call. But for 2024 next year still no equity that's still accurate correct? Rejji Hayes : That's exactly right. Durgesh Chopra : Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today is from the line of David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. David, please go ahead. Rejji Hayes : Hi, David. David Arcaro : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. You alluded to this on the last question, but maybe just directly on as you look into 2024 what's your comfort level you've pulled a lot of cost levers for this year to the extent there are any incremental challenges into 2024. But do you still feel like you're setting up with the same quantum of flexibility around cost structure and the overall expense structure as you look toward hitting your guidance next year? Rejji Hayes : Yeah David. Appreciate the question. This is Rejji. So as you think about the glide path to deliver on the guidance we initiated today, we're guiding $3.06 to $3.12 in 2023 and then $3.27 to $3.33 in 2024. And so that implies somewhere around $0.20 of pickup year-over-year to get to midpoint to midpoint or thereabouts. And so as I think about it, obviously, the weather we had this year we're looking at roughly $0.30 of weather and that's just the mild weather experience over the first three quarters of the year and we anticipate basically being flat in the fourth quarter. So you have to imagine that because we plan for normal weather, we shouldn't anticipate that $0.30 of weather impacting us next year. Now the reality is there have been some one-timers as I've mentioned in my prior remarks on the tender financing side. And so we'd have to assume that those don't recur as well. And so when you net the two of those out you get about $0.10 of pickup. And then if you think about the pending rate case we have. We had a very constructive gas rate case settlement in the third quarter of this year that was approved by the commission. We've got a pending electric rate case and then we'll file another gas rate case in December this year. And with the anticipation of constructive outcomes on those proceedings that offers about per-preliminary estimates maybe somewhere between $0.10 to $0.15 net of investment related costs of pickup. And then again a lot of the cost savings I enumerated earlier, we expect a decent portion of those to be sustained and so we'll get additional pickup there. And so you can get to a glide path of that $0.20 per share again for that year-over-year growth relatively easily when you look at those pieces. Now there are always puts and takes. And again there are some things that will roll off going into 2024. And I think what's highly debatable is will we see the same quantum of service restoration expense going into next year because clearly we've had a record level of storm activity as I noted in our prepared remarks. And so as we think about the glide path it's going to be a combination of rate relief, net of investment-related costs with our pending proceedings. We'll see the weather roll off. We'll see some of the one-timers roll off. And then we expect some of the savings from a lot of the cost reduction initiatives to provide a tailwind on a net basis next year as well. So that's what gives us confidence that we can deliver on the 2024 guide. Is that helpful? David Arcaro : Yeah, very helpful. I appreciate all the color. All good points. And let's see what also just going to check on could you just give the latest update in terms of what you're seeing with the voluntary green pricing program potential upside from that program and just expectations for how customer additions could trend from here? Garrick Rochow : Yeah, it continues to be very positive. And so remember we're in what I'd call a tranche of 1,000 megawatts that is being contracted out. There's significant demand from our customers for those products. We're well over 400 megawatts of contracted lower that continues to grow. And then that's driving to more build from a renewable perspective. And so we've announced even within the quarter the intent to build a solar facility in the current -- coal facility that will help meet some of that -- a portion of that need. So again very robust continued strong interest from our commercial and industrial customers. David Arcaro : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question today is from the line of Nicholas Campanella of Barclays. Nicholas, please go ahead. Nicholas Campanella : Hey, thanks for taking my question everyone. Just one for me. A lot of them have been answered. But I guess just looking at the resiliency plan you kind of start to show the SADI scores improving '25, '26, but I was just trying to dig in more on how you're thinking about operational risk reduction for '24. Just given lessons learned from last year's storm cycle and I assume you're probably actively deploying some of this technology now. So just how should we kind of think about storm risk '24 versus this year? Thanks. Garrick Rochow : Great question. I'm glad you're digging into it. That's a fun plan to look at. Right now -- and that's why I shared in some of my prepared remarks like we're not waiting. And the commission has been supportive of additional tree removal or vegetation management. That's more than doubled our spend over the last three years. So that's active work that's underway. There's close to 300 crews that are on our system contracted crews that are out doing that work today and have been over the course of the year. And we -- in those areas where we do the work we see greater than a 60% improvement well underway. In addition to that fusing, 15,000 fuses over the last two years and a plan to do more next year as well. That takes -- when there's an interruption on the system like fuse box in your home. And so rather than the whole home going out you might lose the bathroom or the kitchen. Same type of thing on the electric. We're fusing that. So when there's an interruption, less customers are impacted. We're seeing SADI performance improvement already from the deployment of those fuses. We've never done this level of fusing, never across our history. We continue to add automation. I just saw a great one the other day being able to -- one of the things on our high-voltage distribution system we've got what's called a Victor insulator. Now Victor insulators are prone to failure. That's a known problem. But once you put them on the grid back in the '70s we didn't have the best kind of control on where those went. And so to be able to identify them you got to be able to see the small little D on top of the Victor insulator. Before we got to stick a bucket truck up there to see that. That's very inefficient. Now with drones, with the ability to automatically pull from a picture to see that little D, we're able to find that find those victor insulators and be very strategic about replacing them. So I'm excited about the technology we're bringing to bear as well. And so those are just a few examples. There are hundreds of examples like we are not satisfied with our reliability performance. We are going to make it better. We've seen the improvement over 2022. We continue to be on good pace this year even with the storms. And so -- and we're going to keep the -- sorry with the analogy, we're keeping the foot down on the floor on the accelerator on this. Nicholas Campanella : All right. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Travis Miller of Morningstar. Travis, please go ahead. Travis Miller : Good morning everyone. Thank you. On the distribution plan, I wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you expect the timing of the regulatory review on that to be? Garrick Rochow : It's going to be -- those will get woven into electric rate case filings. And so the plan by itself will get some comment, but that's not a contested filing. What will happen is those -- that will be the -- it's truly a road map. It's really a vision of where we're headed and the important pieces that have to come together for that. And so, those get brought into electric rate case filings and then with commission support they can be approved. I would just highlight one thing, one announcement we've had here in the last couple of weeks though Department of Energy grant of $100 million. That really jump starts some of this important work. And so, again to the previous question, we're not waiting around. We see some opportunities to put this to work immediately. But again the regulatory process is through the rate cases. Travis Miller : Okay. So that suggests you probably continue that annual type run rate of electric rate cases and even potentially gas rate cases, but especially the electric. Is that roughly correct? Garrick Rochow : Yes, you should expect an annual rate case type filing and I would just offer to in these particularly with the interest rates the way they are 10-month rate cases and forward-looking test years and the kind of the annual strategy really eliminates some of that drag that you get with higher interest rates. And so, there's a lot of benefits of that approach. Travis Miller : Okay. And then just real quick with the investment recovery mechanism change that timing at all, or still even if you get that still kind of a 1-year sort of rate. Garrick Rochow : It will still be a one-year approach. The IRM is not big enough at this point. It's a starting spot. And over time, we'd look to enhance that. The first step is to get it in place which is part of this current electric rate case. Travis Miller : Okay. Very good. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Travis. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Sophie, please go ahead. Sophie Karp : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. A lot of questions have been answered but I wanted to ask you about the cost of capital and like the ROEs, right? So a bit of a push-pull in Michigan as in many other states right now. I'm just kind of curious how the conversations about the need for higher ROE lending with the stakeholders at the commission. Like I'm not sure a few people are catching on to how fast the rates have risen and that really needs to you're going to have some adjustment to how they are as viewed I guess in the last few years. So any color on that would be helpful. Rejji Hayes : Yes, Sophie, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question. Let me just start by saying we're certainly making the case and have made the case really for the last few years around the need to have higher ROEs just given the changing cost of capital environment. I think treasuries probably a couple of hundred basis points higher than where they were when we first had 9.9% established as the prevailing ROE across our electric and gas businesses and DTs and parity as well. And so we're certainly making the case. And I think the case becomes stronger and stronger every day as we see continued hawkish monetary policy. So I think if \u2013 to give you any confidence I think it's \u2013 we feel very good about the fact that there's a good floor at the 9.9% prevailing ROE but we're going to continue to make the case that it should be higher. As Garrick noted, we're seeking 10.25% in our pending electric case. And again, I think the data support that point of view. And we try to make the case in addition to all the different ways in which you can calculate the cost of equity. The fact is that we compete for capital against other utilities and other jurisdictions. And given the quantum of capital that we have not just in our current 5-year plan but in what we anticipate being our next and subsequent 5-year plans we do think we need to be as competitive as possible on all fronts because you can take your dollars elsewhere as investors. And so we've been making the case loudly and clearly I think DTE as well and hopefully we can start to see a change in the wind here with respect to ROEs. Sophie Karp : Got it. Thank you. And then maybe if I can squeeze one more in. You've been doing your underground in pilots. And I'm just curious what have you learned so far from this pilot project maybe in terms of cost or approach that needs to be taken. Curious if you can provide any color on how that is going. Garrick Rochow : Well just a point of clarification what's introduced in the electric case is a pilot a pilot of 10 miles. And as I shared small but important so that the Public Service Commission has the opportunity to evaluate \u2013 now we do do undergrounding already. We do it in the context of subdivisions and the like and we have done a couple of trial runs. And what we've seen is very cost effective because of our gas business directional drilling underground is one of our specialties. We certainly have the equipment and the expertise to do that. And so we're able to be very competitive from an underground perspective. Now our plan stays out of congested area, stays out of 3-phase construction. And so we're talking single phase more royal construction where you have the right floor conditions and we do over much Michigan, which helps from a cost perspective. And so we've shared historically \u2013 historically more current I guess in the $350,000 a mile is we think very achievable. Sophie Karp : All right. Thank you so much. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today is from the line of Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho. Anthony, your line is open. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, all of my questions have been answered. Thanks so much. I am good. Garrick Rochow : Good to hear from you, Anthony. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ross Fowler of UBS. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Fowler : Hi, Garrick, hi, Rejji how are you? Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Ross. Rejji Hayes : Hey, Ross. How are you? Ross Fowler : Good morning. Let's take it to the full hour why not. And Garrick there\u2019s lot as many auto \u2013 auto analogies as you'd like in the answer to this question. But I just wanted to get an update on the estimated bills meter installation issue given the commission filed that show cost a couple of days ago. So I know Rejji kind of talked about this back when I saw in August but just an update there. And then the second part of the question is do you think that has any sort of lateral impacts on the rate case proceeding, or from your perspective is the commission really looking at these as two separate filings and issues. Garrick Rochow : So I don't know if I have any auto analogies for this one. We talked about this in great detail and I provide probably a long answer maybe too long an answer on the Q2 call. So I'll try to be brief but this is just the next step in that. And so what I shared back again briefly what I shared in Q2 was recall that we had some 3G meters that were no longer supported. Our vendor could not meet some of the supply chain needs again considered a carryover from the pandemic and did not meet some of the read required reads out in the field. And so that creates some billing issues for our customers. That's a problem. And the Public Service Commission clearly identified that. And so we shared in our Q2 call that that issue is behind us. We filed a report in August and this is the next step to reach resolution. And so I don't it's an important step. It gets us to the final end of this with the commission. I don't see any spillover impact into the electric rate case or in any other filings. Ross Fowler : All right. Thank you very much. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Ross. Operator : And we have no further questions in the queue today. So I'd like to hand back to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any final remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Harry and I'd like to thank you for joining us today. We'll see you at EEI. Please take care and stay safe. Operator : This concludes today's conference.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the CMS Energy 2023 Year-End Results. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.  This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions]. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 P.M. Eastern Time running through February 8. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Srikanth Maddipati : Thank you, Emily. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the appendix and posted on our website. As some of you may know, this will be my last earnings call, as I've transitioned to a new role in the company, responsible for electric supply and the implementation of the New Energy Law. While I'm excited for my new role and responsibilities, I will miss working with all of you in the investment community so closely. I want to thank you for the support you've all given me in this company.  Jason Shore, a 25-year veteran at CMS, has been named Treasurer and VP of Investor Relations. As I hand over the baton, I'm confident in Jason and our very experienced [indiscernible].  And now, I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Sri. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I get started, I want to thank Sri for his leadership in the finance area, and I look forward to his continued growth and impact as he takes on this important role in electric supply, where he'll lead critical filings like our renewable energy plan and integrated resource plan, which I will discuss later in this call.  We have a deep bench of talent at CMS Energy. And it is critically important that we develop our leaders in key areas of the business, continuing to strengthen the bench, build dexterity, and provide challenging growth opportunities. I know both Sri And Jason will make a big impact in their new roles. I've shared before on these calls, this isn't our first rodeo. The CMS team delivers now 21 years of exceptional performance. I am proud to share with you the highlights of the year. And I am proud of this team. You will see in the numbers and our operational highlight, 2023 was an incredible year. We met and faced challenges that tested our team and we rose to the occasion.  First, let's talk about the weather. The 2022/2023 winter was in that top 10 warmest on record. And then there was summer. When much of the world saw temperature warmer temperatures, our summer, influenced by El Nino conditions, was cooler than normal. And then, December 2023, the second warmest December on record. Add to that, record storm activity within our service territory. To say the least, it was a challenging year.  Despite severe storms and unfavorable weather, we delivered and offset nearly $300 million of weather-related financial headwinds, serving our customers with heat and light and keeping our financial commitments for our investors. This world class team comes together and we do what we say we will do year in and year out. No excuses, just results.  As I said earlier, I'm proud of the team at CMS Energy. There are a number of great things we delivered in the year, even more than are represented on slide 4. In the interest of time, I want to hit on just a few. I want to highlight the Freedom Award from the Secretary of Defense, and why this is so special. This is the highest recognition a company can receive for supporting their employees who serve in the Guard and Reserve. The nomination was submitted by one of our employees and demonstrates the commitment of our entire company. This is an important part of our culture, to support and care for our people. And to honor our coworkers who serve our customers and our country. We continue our focus on leading the clean energy transformation. In 2023. we retire over 500 megawatts of coal, further reducing our carbon footprint. Alongside these retirements, we ensured resource adequacy with the acquisition of the 1.2 gigawatt Covert natural gas generating station and brought online our 201 megawatt Heartland wind farm. This thoughtful transition ensures customer reliability as we move our portfolio from coal to clean. I also want to give a shout out to our small, but important NorthStar Clean Energy team. They performed well in 2023, exceeding our expectations for the year, completing the Newport solar project and demonstrating strong operational performance at Dearborn industrial generation, DIG. Another solid year of execution at CMS Energy across the triple bottom line, delivering industry leading, sustainable premium growth.  In 2023, Michigan also passed new energy legislation, starting the course for cleaner energy in Michigan, while maintaining resource adequacy, customer affordability and strengthening our financial plan. This legislation speaks to the constructive Financial Plan. This legislation speaks to the constructive nature of Michigan, provides more incentives to grow our clean energy portfolio, furthering investment opportunities with increased certainty of recovery.  Now, it's still early days. We're evaluating all aspects of the new law, including the strategic advantage of owning versus contract and supply, the increased incentive on PPAs and what makes the most sense for us and for our customers.  The law provides a lot of flexibility and options, which is important. You'll see this play out in a couple of upcoming filings. I want to draw your attention to the Renewable Energy Plan. This is not a new filing, but becomes a more important input in the Integrated Resource Plan. The Renewable Energy Plan will detail our plan to meet the 60% renewable portfolio standard by 2035.  As you might imagine, this work is underway. We plan to file in the second half of the year. Following our renewable energy plan filing, our next 20-year Integrated Resource Plan is due in 2027. Together, the Renewable Energy Plan and Integrated Resource Plan will align our supply resources to deliver cost competitive, cleaner, and reliable energy as we target net zero. They also provide important transparency and certainty as we advance the business forward with investments in renewables and clean energy.  Michigan Energy Law continues to support its strong regulatory environment and needed customer investments. While the recent legislation provides opportunities to file our updated Renewable Energy Plan, the regulatory calendar is fairly routine in 2024. Our electric rate case continues toward a constructive outcome. We've seen positive indicators with key stakeholder support for recovery of customer investments and important investment mechanisms, such as the IRM and our undergrounding pilot. We expect an order from the Commission on or before March 1.  We filed our gas rate case in mid-December, with an ask of $136 million with a 10.25% ROE and in a 51.5% equity ratio. The request lines with needed investments outlined in our 10-year natural gas delivery plan. We expect an order for the end of the year.  On slide 7, we've highlighted our new five-year, $17 billion utility customer investment plan, which supports approximately 7.5% rate base growth through 2028. You will note that about 40% of our customer investment opportunities support renewable generation, grid modernization and maintenance service replacements on our gases, which are critical as we lead the clean energy transformation. The plan also includes an increased investment in the electric distribution system to improve reliability and resiliency for our customers.  We also have growth drivers outside of traditional rate base. These include adders built into legislation for incentives on energy efficiency programs and the financial compensation mechanism we earn on PPA that I mentioned earlier.  We also expect incremental earnings provided by our non-utility business, NorthStar Clean Energy, as they see attractive pricing from capacity and energy sold at DIG.  It's important to note we have a long and robust runway of additional investment opportunities both within and beyond the five-year window. As an example, we've incorporated a little less than half of the incremental $3 billion of customer investments associated with our electric reliability roadmap. We've also not yet included the customer investments associated with the new energy law. These will be included in our renewable energy plan filing and will provide more opportunities for investment.  I feel good about our five-year utility investment plan. It is focused on our customers. It positions the business for continued success and delivers for all stakeholders.  With that, I'll conclude with the 2023 results and long term outlook before passing it over to Rejji, who will cover the financials in more detail. 2023, no excuses, not weather, not storms, just results. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.11 or the high end of our guidance range. I'm also pleased to share that we are raising our 2024 adjusted full-year EPS guidance $0.02 to $3.29 to $3.35 from $3.27 to $3.33 per share, compounding off of 2023 actual result. Let me repeat, compounding off of actuals. That is a differentiator in this sector. We continue to expect to be toward the high end of our 2024 guidance range, which points to our confidence as we start the year.  Furthermore, the CMS Energy Board of Directors recently approved a dividend increase to $2.06 per share for 2024. Longer term, we continue to guide for the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which implies and includes 7%, up to 8%. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. We continue to grow the dividend. You'll see that we are targeting a dividend payout ratio of about 60% over time.  Finally, we remain confident in our plan for 2024 and beyond, given our longstanding inability to manage the work and consistently deliver industry-leading growth.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick. And good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2023, with adjusted net income of $907 million, which translates to $3.11 per share, toward the high end of our guidance range.  The key drivers of our 2023 financial performance included strong cost performance throughout the organization, fueled by CE Way, a solid beat at NorthStar and a variety of non-operational countermeasures, such as liability management and tax planning, which more than offset the significant weather-related headwinds experienced throughout the year.  And to further underscore the magnitude of cost performance delivered by our workforce, our fourth quarter operating and maintenance, or O&M, expense, exclusive of service restoration and vegetation management, was approximately 25% below the comparable period in 2022 and over 20% below our five year average for this cost category, a truly impressive achievement.  All in, we managed to offset nearly $300 million of weather-related financial headwinds, without compromising our operational commitments to our customers and the communities we serve.  At CMS, we've had plenty of years of adversity, followed by impressive operational and financial beat, but I can't recall one quite like 2023, a year in which our workforce personified grit and displayed that perennial will to deliver for all stakeholders. To elaborate on the strength of our financial performance in 2023, on slide 10, you'll note that we've met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. From a financing perspective, we successfully settled $178 million of equity forward contracts in November and settled the remaining roughly $265 million in forwards in January. As a reminder, these forwards are pricing levels favorable to our planning assumption.  The only financial target missed in 2023 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility, which was budgeted for $3.7 billion. We ended the year below that, at $3.3 billion, primarily due to siting and permitting delays at select solar projects. As mentioned in the past, we fully intend to build out all of the solar projects approved in IRP and voluntary green pricing [indiscernible]. And with the Michigan Renewable Energy siting reform bill passed last fall, we should see better progress here going forward.  Moving to our 2024 EPS guidance on slide 11. We are raising our 2024 adjusted earnings guidance range to $3.29 to $3.35 per share from $3.27 to $3.33 per share, as Garrick noted, with continued confidence toward the high end of the range.  As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility, providing $3.74 to $3.80 of adjusted earnings, the details of which I'll cover on the next slide. At NorthStar, we're assuming EPS contribution of $0.16 to $0.18, which reflects strong underlying performance, primarily DIG, and ongoing contributions from our renewables business.  Lastly, our financing assumptions remain conservative at the parent segment and our 2024 guidance range assumes the absence of liability management transactions. As always, we'll remain opportunistic in this regard, and we'll look to capitalize on attractive market conditions, should they arise.  To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range, you'll see the usual waterfall chart on slide 12. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analyses herein are measured on a full-year basis and are relative to 2023. From left to right, we'll plan for normal weather which in this case amounts to $0.43 per share of positive year-over-year variance, given the absence of the atypically mild temperatures experienced throughout 2023. Additionally, we anticipate $0.23 of EPS pickup, attributable rate relief, really driven by the residual benefits of last year's constructive gas rate case settlement and assumed supportive outcomes on our pending electric and gas rate cases. As always, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs, which is depreciation, property taxes and utility interest expense.  As we turn to our cost structure in 2024, you'll note $0.16 per share of positive variance due to continued productivity, driven by the CE Way, the ongoing benefits of cost reduction measures implemented in 2023, which was our voluntary separation plan which reduced our salaried workforce by roughly 10%, and initiatives already underway. It is also worth noting that our cost assumptions exclude the impact of the catastrophic ice storm we experienced in the first quarter of 2023. Lastly, in the penultimate bar, on the right hand side, you'll notice significant negative variance, which largely consists of the reversal of select one-time cost reduction measures. These are partially offset by the ongoing benefits of our well executed financing plan in 2023, and we're assuming the usual conservative assumptions around whether normalized sales, taxes and non-utility performance, among other items. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.58 to $0.64 per square of negative variance. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions throughout the year to mitigate risks and deliver our operational and financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors.  On slide 13, we have a summary of our near and long-term financial objectives. To avoid being repetitive, I'll focus my remarks on those metrics we have not yet covered. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment grade credit ratings, and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly, as we balance the needs of the business.  As previously mentioned, we have already settled the remaining equity forwards and have no additional equity needs in 2024. Longer term, we intend to resume our at the market or ATM equity issuance program in the amount of up to $350 million per year beginning in 2025 and extending through 2028, which is essentially the same assumption in our previous five year plan, but for the extension of an additional year. We're able to maintain our pre-existing equity needs despite an increase in utility capital plan, given the expectation of strong operating cash flow generation and the ability to monetize tax credits, courtesy of Inflation Reduction Act. It is also worth noting that this morning's decision by Moody's to increase the equity credit ascribed to junior subordinated notes, which represents about 40% of our debt at the parent company, is not embedded in our plan, thus providing further cushion in these metrics.  Slide 14 offers more specificity on the balance of our funding needs in 2024, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility, over half of which has been opportunistically issued as noted on the page. And the coupon rate on this newly issued debt is favorable to plan, thus providing a helpful tailwind as we start the year.  Over the coming year, we have no planned long term financings at the parent and already redeemed at full maturity in January at par. Longer term, we have relatively modest near term maturities at the parent, with $250 million due in 2025 and $300 million due in 2026. On slide 15, we've refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan is minimized.  Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices, our diverse and battle tested workforce remains committed to our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance.  Before I hand it back to Garrick, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to echo Garrick's praise of Sri, whom I've worked closely with over the past seven years. Sri's contributions to the finance team and the company have been immeasurable since he joined CMS. So thank you, Sri. You're leaving it better than you found it, and I look forward to working with you and Jason in your new roles.  And with that, I'll pass it on to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Rejji. You all know this last slide very well by now. Over two decades, regardless of conditions, no excuses, just results. Given the challenges of 2023, I'm extremely proud of the team's effort. Our simple investment thesis is how we run our business. It has withstood the test of time, and provides us confidence for a strong outlook in 2024 and beyond. With that, Emily, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Nicholas Campanella : Sri, great work with you all these years. Best of luck in the new role. Just to get started, could you maybe just help us understand the DIG uplift and kind of context of the current 6% to 8% CAGR? You have some open capacity there. The current run rates are clearly higher. Just what's the timeline to lock that in? And how should we kind of think about the uplift to the 6% to 8% or perhaps just adding higher visibility in extending the 6% to 8% for even longer? Garrick Rochow : Those traditional, what I call, outside of base growth, so those growth drivers outside of traditional rate base \u2013 energy efficiency, financial compensation mechanism and DIG \u2013 those are powerful in the plan.  And you asked specifically about Dearborn Industrial Generation. We are seeing both energy and capacity of prices elevated, particularly in the out years of the plan. We have available capacity beyond 2026 out through the plan. We're layering in contracts, really as we speak, which with attractive numbers and which gives us confidence in our plan, particularly in the out-years through DIG. Nicholas Campanella : On the REP plan, I guess if you file second half of 2024, can you just help us understand regulatory process? When would there be a decision there? Or what does that kind of look like? And then how does that kind of flow through to your CapEx plan? Would it be like this time next year we kind of get an update on how that flows through? Garrick Rochow : First of all, this is not a new filing. It is a more important filing. It is a bigger filing. As you might imagine, if you're going to achieve 60% renewable by 2035 or 50% by 2030, it has to grow from a size perspective. So it takes on increased importance.  It's also important to remember it's based on energy versus the Integrated Resource Plan, which is based on capacity. So that work is underway. And it's really a spectrum. To meet that standard, do you do all PPAs? That's one bookend. Or do you do all ownership?  I view it somewhere in the middle. But what's the strength of this energy law is there's a lot of flexibility to be able to start that path to those clean energy ambitions. We've got to think about what the customer impact is. We're still required as a load serving entity to meet resource capacity constraints in the IRP. So that's a consideration. We've got to look at the balance sheet. And here's a really capital light option where we can get an FCM at 9%. That's a really attractive part of this energy law. So there's a lot of dynamics that have to play out in there. That work is underway right now.  We will file that Renewable Energy Plan in the second half of the year. We have until 2025 to get it done, but we want to pull that forward into 2024, given the work that has to be done and these milestones that are out there.  So we'll file that. The commission has and staff has 10 months to get to a final order. And then that information there will certainly aid our capital plan and the upside from an FCM mechanism, but also flows into our Integrated Resource Plan. And that Integrated Resource Plan should become less complex because of this Renewable Energy Plan work.  Ultimately, that then flows into rate cases as we move forward over time on the annual frequency.  So, I know Rejji has some more comments on this as well. So, I'll pass it to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : All I would add to Garrick's good comments is, as you think about that trajectory and sequencing the Garrick laid out, it's important to note that the plan that we laid out today, that takes you from 2024 to 2028 does not incorporate any capital investment opportunities associated with the new legislation. And so, as we file the REP in the second half of this year and then get feedback presumably in the second half of 2025, we won't start incorporating capital opportunities, most likely for a couple of vintages of five year plans. Now, we have started to layer in the energy waste reduction or energy efficiency opportunities, as well as modest portion of the FCM opportunities. But I think in subsequent five year plans, you'll start to see more FCM-related opportunities and certainly more capital opportunities, but it's going to take a couple of vintages before we have real clarity on that. Is that helpful? Operator : The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to touch base, I guess, a little bit more on the Moody's change this morning. If you could just walk us through that a bit and quantify how much equity credit that is, just trying to get a sense for what that means. Rejji Hayes : Jeremy, this is Rejji. So, Moody's this morning increased the equity credit that they ascribe to junior subordinated notes, which are more informally referred to as hybrids. It was previously a 25% equity credit. And they're essentially now at parity with S&P at 50%.  The reason why that's impactful for us is that we've issued those securities quite a bit over the last five to six years, and so currently represents about 40% of our debt portfolio at the holdco. And so, by them, increasing the equity credit ascribed to this, it really increases, I'd say, the FFO to debt metrics at Moody's by that 50 to 60 basis points. So fairly accretive from a credit perspective to plan. Jeremy Tonet : As we approach finalizing the electric rate case, just wondering if you could provide any more incremental thoughts, I guess, on how you feel about how things are progressing there. Just any color will be appreciated. Garrick Rochow : Jeremy, things are progressing nicely. I feel good about a constructive outcome. Staff had a great starting spot on what I think can be a constructive outcome and feel confident that we can get there. There's a lot of positive indicators. Support for the important work on reliability. I would say there's a great alignment between staff and, frankly, the commissioners on where we want to go, improve reliability in the state. That's a big part of this electric rate case. And also, positive indicators on the mechanisms that we've talked about in the past, this infrastructure recovery mechanism. We think that's really important from a go forward reliability perspective. It also lines up with [indiscernible] have shared about ring fencing and providing opportunity to capital to see the insight of where those investments are and how they make a difference. And then, finally, our undergrounding pilot. That's seeing support as well. That's an important first step in this resiliency play and our larger ambitions that are evident in our reliability roadmap. So, again, I feel really good about where the case is headed. And we expect the final order on or before March 1. Operator : Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Just a real quick cleanup question on the CapEx and rate base. Is part of the rate base CAGR increase to that firm 7.5% and the higher CapEx run rate, is that driven by some of the spending and solar delays in 2023, so slightly off, maybe a lower base and timing differences? Or is it driven by new CapEx, the tail end of the plan, or maybe a combination of both, especially since you guys don't really include a lot of CapEx until we get through the approval process right. Rejji Hayes : I would say it's largely due to the latter and that's incremental CapEx. So, remember, we have the electrical liability roadmap that we provided \u2013 that we filed with the commission in late September of last year. And so, that had $3 billion of incremental CapEx opportunity versus the prior vintage. We haven't incorporated all of that. But about half is, as per Garrick's prepared remarks, so call it roughly a good portion of that $1.5 billion step up in our new plan versus our old plan. We also do have increased renewable investments. But I wouldn't say that that's sort of the deferrals that are coming into 2024 from 2023. Yes, there's a little bit of that, but it's largely an additional IRP execution on the renewable side, as well as our voluntary green pricing program. So I'd say the vast majority of that uplift from our five year CapEx plan, the current one versus the prior, is driven by electrical liability related investments, and then you've got a portion attributable to clean energy investments, largely renewables. Garrick Rochow : Let me just reinforce that. And the way I would like to think about, add on to Rejji's good comments there, is that clean energy piece in the supply, it's what's approved in our 2022 IRP. And the upside will be to the tail end because we haven't built in any of this new energy law, as Rejji stated in some earlier comments. So, as that renewable energy plan is filed and eventually approved, then you'll see that it will slightly hit the tail, but even beyond the five years, you can see a nice path of 10 years of investment opportunity as a result of this energy law. Shahriar Pourreza : It just sounds like it's more incremental versus shifting from 2023 to 2024. Okay. And then, just on the balance sheet, the $350 million in equity after 2025, I guess, does that contemplate sort of increases beyond the current CapEx plan as you look to ramp up reliability and renewable spending? Rejji Hayes : This just incorporates the current five year plan of $17 billion of utility CapEx. And it's enough work to prepare these five year plans. So we're not thinking about year six through 10, just yet. So I would say that it's, again, just the $17 billion utility CapEx plan and the funding associated there with. But as per my prepared remarks, we're quite pleased that even with that upward pressure on equity needs as a result of that growing capital plan, we didn't have to change the annual amount. So we're still up to $350 million as we were in our prior plan, and it has a lot to do with just good cash flow generation and the plan to monetize tax credits as a result of the IRA. Shahriar Pourreza : Last one is just on the Palisades, revival seems to be moving forward with the DOE loans. Does that change sort of the calculus maybe from a resource planning perspective? Would you be open to purchasing the power under an FCM construct? Or does it still seem too expensive for you? Garrick Rochow : We're watching the activity on Palisades. But I just want to remind everybody on the call here, we're not involved in Palisades. And from a PPA perspective, it's spoken for, both with two coops. And so, we're not engaged at all within that process.  Now, we hope, from an implication perspective, we think it's great for Michigan, and we wish them well and success in getting the plan up and operational. Shahriar Pourreza : So no change in your resource planning is, I guess, the point was. Garrick Rochow : No change in the resource planning. And I would just remind everybody, even with that potential out there, we see great opportunities in energy and capacity that are evident at Dearborn Industrial Generation. Operator : The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : Congratulations to both Sri and Jason. Really great working with both of you. I was curious if you could give your latest thoughts on load growth expectations here and whether you're seeing any increased activity in manufacturing or data center growth kind of hit the radar. Garrick Rochow : Let me start and then I'll pass it over to Rejji too. There's a lot of great things going on in Michigan from an economic development perspective. Onshore and friend-shoring, benefits of the CHIPS Act, IRA, we're seeing growth in polysilicon, we're seeing growth in semiconductors, we're seen growth in agricultural processing, battery manufacturing, and parts that go into vehicles and the like. So just a lot of manufacturing growth, which I love. Frankly, it creates jobs. It has a supply chain that goes with it. And frankly, there's a lot of margin in those areas.  To your point, we're also seeing some data center growth. That's part of the plan. But we get really excited with the manufacturing side just because of the other additional benefits that are associated with that.  So, that's kind of a big level picture. And that pipeline continues. We've got a nice pipeline of growth into the years. And I want to remind everybody, we're playing conservatively. And we're not counting any of that upward supply and sales type opportunities until we see the meter spinning. So that's just our conservative approach. But let me hand it over to Rejji for some additional comments. Rejji Hayes : David, I think Garrick summarized it pretty well. And the big takeaway here is we plan conservatively. But what I'm pleased to represent, just to add some numbers to Garrick's good comments is that, you think about the last several planning cycles we've had, we've suggested that we've had sort of flat to stable or slightly declining load growth. And it's always important to remember that our load growth math includes our energy efficiency actions where we're basically reducing load year-over-year by 2%. And so, if you that into account, we've been up about 2% or thereabouts on a gross basis for many years. But this current plan, on a five-year basis, offers about a 1% swing from where we were just in our last five year plan. And so, we're assuming little over 0.5% of growth over this five year plan, again, inclusive of our energy efficiency efforts.  And so, even though Garrick highlighted that we have a pretty robust and diverse pipeline of opportunities, all we have embedded in our current five year plan are the two large projects that were announced over the last year or so with Goshen and Ford. And so, that's really all we have incorporated in our plan. And I'll tell you, candidly, we'll be disappointed if that's all we're talking about in the next two to three years, given, again, the breadth and depth of our pipeline today. So good opportunities going forward on the load front. We're already seeing that in the numbers, but I think there's more opportunity going forward. David Arcaro : Back on the topic of rate cases, I was just wondering your latest thoughts on the ability to settle rate cases, not for the electric one, obviously, but maybe your gas rate case, and then more broadly going forward in the state for future rate case activity? Garrick Rochow : We have a historic practice, and we're coming off a four or five \u2013 I have lost track now \u2013 settlements. And so, that's still part of our makeup. We're still going to look at how to \u2013 when a case is underway, how we best reach the right conclusion for our customers and for our investors. And so, we look at those opportunities. I've been on these calls before and said, I look for any opportunity for settlement when the conditions are right. But we're also comfortable going forward because we're that confident on our ability to get a constructive outcome here in Michigan.  This gas case that we filed in December, fairly straightforward. I'm hopeful that we can reach a settlement. Again, if it doesn't, that's okay, too. We can get a constructive outcome here in Michigan. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Michael Sullivan : I know this got asked like a couple different ways, Rejji, but just on the equity needs, maybe if you could just frame how to think about where they could go as CapEx goes higher as we start to roll forward with the REP refresh, like taking into context the ability to use transferability, this cushion you got for Moody's, like CapEx goes up by x, how much could that potentially increase equity? Rejji Hayes : I would say, clearly, we've made the working assumptions in this current five year plan quite clear, up to $350 million starting in 2025 through the duration of this plan out to 2028. As it pertains to future five year plans, mathematically, I would say yes, if your capital plan increases, and I think based on what we've talked about with respect to the prospects in the New Energy Law, we will see upward pressure on our capital plan going forward. Remember, they are sources of offsetting pressure. Given the strength of the regulatory construct in Michigan, there's very strong operating cash flow generation, which obviously provides a source of internal equity. And then, we've got now sources of downward pressure with the ability to monetize tax credits. The amount we have embedded in our plan is just over $0.5 billion. And I expect that to accrete over time as we take on new renewable projects. And then, obviously, the good news from Moody's this morning, offers a little bit more headroom on the Moody's side. Now, I would not suggest at the moment that we're prepared to give sort of new equity needs on a hypothetical basis, but we'll recalibrate every year. But I think, again, the strong sources of downward pressure on equity needs will be operating cash flow generation, the ability to monetize credits, and obviously, Moody's decision today is helpful. And, obviously, we plan conservatively. So that's the other aspect of it as well.  And, obviously, with the great rate construct, in addition to the cash flow generation, we have a solid level of retained earnings, particularly with a very disciplined dividend policy that Garrick highlighted in his prepared remarks. So that's the other aspect of that as well. Michael Sullivan : Just wanted to check in the latest on the [indiscernible] looking at, performance base rates in Michigan, and where that stands and where you potentially see that going. Garrick Rochow : The process is well underway, Michael, and it's improving. We've seen a move from a handful of metrics down to four metrics that are very benchmarkable across the industry. Our next set of comments are due by February 2.  And what we're leaning into in those comments is a better connection between these outcomes and reliability and more certainty on capital recovery. If you look at best practices for performance based rate making across the country, frankly across the globe, there's a greater tie between here's the outcome and here's the certainty on recovery. So we're wanting to make sure in our comments that that is true here in Michigan. And so, that's the work that's underway.  So we'll continue to follow the process. And I'm sure here, just given the constructive nature of Michigan, we can get to a place, a good landing spot for PBR. Michael Sullivan : And any sense of just timing on when it could all kind of come to a conclusion? Garrick Rochow : We're still in process right now. Like I said, comments are due here February 2. Ideally, here, there's some milestones around May timeframe as well, but we haven't got a clear picture on ending perspective.  The next electric rate case will be on this one. Operator : The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Maybe zeroing back to where we've been talking about the balance sheet here for a little bit. I just want to clarify what's in the updated CFO, the cash flow number that you projected? I presume that doesn't include any kind of expectations for uplift on DIG, among other factors. Also, maybe we could talk at the same time about how much additional latitude you're getting from Moody's, given the tweak with the juniors there.  And then, ultimately, on the dividend, it seems like dividend growth may be slowing a little bit. Should that be the new norm here just given maybe trying to target a lower payout given the accelerated growth? Rejji Hayes : That's quite a bit to unpack there. So let me start with DIG and the OCF implications. And so, everything that we've highlighted in our five year plan, so think about the rate base growth up to 7.5%, we also talked about additional opportunities attributable to energy efficiency, these are the non-rate base growth drivers of the utility FCM, and then we talked about non-utility opportunities with DIG recontracting, all of that is incorporated into our earnings as well as our cash flow generation. And so, we have a page in the appendix that shows about a little over $13 billion in aggregate cash flow generation over the course of this five year plan, and that incorporates some recontracting that we've seen at DIG on both the energy and capacity side, but it does not take into account that open margin that we have on slide 21 in the appendix and the potential opportunities if you see a higher capacity price over time. And so, there is some upside both from an earnings and cash flow perspective. So not all of that is baked into the cash flow. So there's additional opportunity there.  Just transitioning over to Moody's, I'll note that the decision to increase the equity credit from 25% to 50% for junior subordinated notes, that's worth about 50 to 60 basis points of FFO to debt accretion. And then, with respect to dividend policy, we've really been very consistent in dividend policy since we sold EnerBank and started to accelerate the earnings growth of the business. And really, the idea has been to trend down to a low 60s percent payout ratio, as Garrick highlighted in his prepared remarks.  And so, what that equates to is really decoupled growth between our DPS growth, our dividend per share growth and our earnings per share growth. We've said 6% to 8% toward the high end earnings per share. We'll probably be closer to the low end as the $0.11 increase today implies, and that'll be the plan going forward. Because we do believe that that's a very efficient use of capital to have the dividend policy in that level, so that we can efficiently fund the growth of the business. And so, really, that's how we're thinking about it going forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah, absolutely. Maybe just to tie that together here, if we look at your FFO metrics all together, you raised the rate base growth up to 7.5% now through the five-year period. I get it's not exactly apples to apples across the years, but it doesn't seem like there's incremental equity versus the original plan, per se. So, how do you think about your metrics through this outlook? Are you actually intact net-net-net, given the various factors we just elaborated on? Are you seeing a slight uptick prior to reflecting some of these other pieces, if you will? Just how do you think about where you land? Rejji Hayes : We feel very good about the credit metrics thing in that mid-teens area, which we have targeted for some time now to preserve the solid investment grade credit rating we've had for many years now, and that's with a longstanding dialogue with the rating agencies.  The OCF generation, coupled with the equity needs, up to $350 million, as well as the monetization of tax credits, and again, just a very disciplined dividend policy, all of that allows us to maintain our credit metrics in that mid-teens area. And again, yes, we've increased the utility CapEx plan. We've held on to the equity needs, and those supporting factors allow us to stay in that level. And certainly, there may be opportunity longer term, but we feel very good about the metrics where they are today and don't intend to deviate from our current credit ratings. I don't think that's the implication in your question, but just wanted to say that for the avoidance of doubt. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just through the plan outlook here, just given all the focus on legislation, can you just clarify what is the sort of expected bill impact or commitment here rather, given all to come on what that means for customers as best you guys are going to try to target this? Garrick Rochow : Julien, to be clear, this is with respect to the new energy legislation? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. As you think about what is on the come, is there any kind of commitment you guys are making on trying to level that out for customers in any specific pace? Garrick Rochow : Needless to say, as we've always talked about when we prepare, not just this five year plan or prior plans, but future plan, the key governors will be affordability, balance sheet, and can we get the work done. And as it pertains to new energy legislation, yes, it does create additional opportunities, whether that's on the capital investment side or on contracts with the financial compensation mechanism. But, trust, we will not turn a blind eye to affordability. And what makes us really excited about the opportunity going forward is when you think about our current energy mix and how we're sourcing energy, we have about $1.5 billion that we spend each year on a combination of PPAs as well as open market repurchases that we're paying a pretty high levelized cost of energy on a weighted average basis. And so, with the new energy law going into effect and the opportunities associated there with, we think there's a lot of headroom to get economics on energy going forward without increasing customer bills.  Now, there's a lot more process left, as Garrick noted, but we do think there's a lot of headroom already in bills for us to potentially deliver on that triple bottom line where there's nice economic opportunity for investors, but, again, not doing that to the detriment of customers. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Andrew Weisel : Two questions. Just to elaborate on your earlier comments, first, 2023 CapEx fell short of your target, $3.3 billion versus $3.7 billion planned. Can you just talk about what happened there? I think some of that might have been the solar delays. And then, what happened to that $400 million? It sounds like that was not part of the $1.5 billion increase. So can you just help explain what happened there? Garrick Rochow : It's expected in the context of a year that you're going to have projects. Andrew, I have 25 years in this business and no project goes exactly as you planned. And sometimes they shift and move. And particularly, with the solar piece, as Rejji mentioned in his prepared remarks, it's really not the supply chain at this point. We've got a lock in on panels and the like. It is really about local entities and siting and permitting. Now we work through that. It just means we might move to a different community or there might be different setbacks that we have to work through. All that is doable, but it does create some shifts in the context of the year.  The key pieces, it's not moving. We still have to deliver on 2030 50% renewables, so you have to be at 60% by 2035. That doesn't change. And so, if it's not in this year, it just moves to a different year. And we'll continue that project. So there's a bit of shifting that ends up moving on the capital plan. So hopefully that helps.  Rejji's got a comment as well. Rejji Hayes : Andrew, what I would add, I think you're sort of reflecting on Shahriar's question and my response to that, to be clear, we do have some of that spend that we did not achieve in 2023. Some of that is certainly pushed into this new five year plan. It's just the vast majority of the increase in this five year plan versus the prior is driven by reliability related investments. So there certainly is a portion of those deferrals being pushed into 2024 and beyond. But, again, the biggest driver of this new five year plan is reliability. Andrew Weisel : A quick follow up on that. In the page 24, you give spending by year. The number for 2028 at $3.1 billion is actually the lowest of the next five years. Directionally, I would have expected the opposite. I personally assume you'll be increasing that as you go through these regulatory processes. But maybe you can just talk about why the trend is dipping down rather than going up every year. Rejji Hayes : Andrew, this is Rejji. I'll take that. So what you're seeing here in that 2024/2025 timeframe is just we do anticipate a pretty big increase in reliability-related investments. And so, that's what's driving a lot of that. Obviously, that's going to be subject to regulatory outcomes. And so, we'll toggle the plan as needed.  And I think Garrick's earlier point is well taken that, these plans, you see capital projects come in and out, some get pushed in, some get pushed out. And so, we do anticipate that smoothing out over time. And so, the composition over this five year timeframe may change, but we feel very good about the quantum overall of $17 billion. And so, you may see some of that lumpiness go in and out \u2013 sorry, smooth out over time. Operator : Next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Rejji, can you quantify for us, of that $13 billion in operating cash flow, how much of that is tax credits monetization? Rejji Hayes : It's about $0.5 billion of tax credit monetization that's incorporated, a little over $0.5 billion. And that really drives a good portion of the vintage over vintage difference. In the prior vintage, I think we were saying, call it, almost $12.5 billion of aggregate cash flow, operating cash flow generation. And this one, we're kind of 13 and change. So, a good portion that's driven by the tax credit monetization, which, again, is over $0.5 billion. Durgesh Chopra : That's like over the five year period, so $100 million a year, roughly speaking. Rejji Hayes : I wouldn't say it's as linear as that. Or as flat as that. I would say it's going to be a little lower in the front end and then it's going to grow over time. Durgesh Chopra : And a quick follow-up. Any update on the storm review process? What's going on there? I know we're expecting a report out, I think in September this year, just any anything you could share there. Garrick Rochow : As I've shared in previous calls, Durgesh, we're working on proven reliability. You can see that in the capital investment plan. You can see that in the reliability roadmap. We're focused on and the Commission is focused on it, the audits underway, good process audit, and I look forward to the results and would anticipate we're going to incorporate in the future rate cases.  From a process perspective, still looks like we're on track for a September timeframe. Operator : The next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Travis Miller : Quick question on slide 12. The $0.16 of the cost savings, how much of that is just the reversal of higher costs and how much is incremental cost savings you're expecting this year? Rejji Hayes : It's Rejji. On the waterfall chart, just for others, reference for 2024, yeah, the $0.16 of pickup that we're seeing \u2013 or that we're anticipating year-over-year, you do see a portion of reversal related to storm activity. Obviously, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had a significant ice storm in the first quarter of 2023. And so, we do not anticipate storms of that magnitude year in and year out.  But we also have a good portion of CE Way related savings. And I'd say it's about $60 million, or call it $0.15. And you have to think about the puts and takes here. So you've got the reversal of storms, you definitely have cost savings embedded in this current plan, but we also have inflation in other cost categories like salaries, as well as other costs, non-labor related costs. And so, there's a mix of inflation, as well as cost savings to offset or fund that inflation. And then that coupled with the reversal of the storm is what drives that $0.16 per share. Travis Miller : A broader question. You have touched on a little bit in the call here, but we think about those clean energy standard buckets in terms of the nuclear, natural gas with carbon capture and renewables, what's your thought long term, in general? I know you don't have those specifics yet. But how those three buckets work for you? It seems like in your earlier comments, nuclear is not really on the table right now. How much does nuclear, natural gas/CC go into that mix when you're thinking about 2035 or 2040? Garrick Rochow : What I love about this energy law is there is a lot of flexibility. There's just a ton of flexibility in there. And that's a strength. And that's served us well in previous energy laws. If you go back to 2016, Integrated Resource Plan, you build a plan that works for your customers, works for your investors and allows you to deliver the energy supply that you need across your service area.  Our focus right now is really on this first step, which is the Renewable Energy Plan. And that is wind, it's solar, it's hydros, we have to hit a milestone by 2030 of 50% and then by 2035 of 60%. Those are important milestones first. So that's our focus right now.  Now, we're not taking our eye off the ball. Like 2040, we have to have 100% clean energy. There's a milestone along that journey as well. That will get into the carbon capture, that will get into other considerations and how we meet that. So that's a broader definition where nuclear is part of it, natural gas with carbon capture.  I anticipate that, once we get this Renewable Energy Plan finalized, we're going to start looking out there at those other future sources. Right now, we would see it, given our natural gas fleet, as consideration for carbon capture as one of the options, but we're not taking anything off the table. You've got to have a wide open landscape, we've got to do right math, got to make sure we have the right plan for our customers and for our investors. So we're not saying no to anything. So hopefully that helps. Operator : The next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Sophie Karp : I wanted to ask you about your prospective growth in renewable energy investments. So basically, as outlined by the new law and the filing you intend to make, I guess what we're seeing in other states and other jurisdictions right now is some sort of a push back maybe on those types of investments. And the genesis of that might be different in different jurisdictions, but it seems that the cost is often a barrier. So my question is, how do you plan to sort of avoid that? And what are the steps you've taken to socialize this plan as to not shock the regulators or intervenors or consumers [indiscernible] that becomes reality. Garrick Rochow : It's a great question. There's a lot of dynamics that play out in any type of construction, whether you're putting in a gas pipeline or whether you're building renewables. And we've really, at a ground level, from a community perspective, is where we see the opportunity to be able to best influence this. For example, we completed the 201 megawatt Heartland wind farm up in the Gratiot County. Gratiot County and surrounding counties have been very welcoming to renewables. And so, we know that because we're on the ground making that happen. And that's the way we intend to approach these at a very local level.  Now there has been a siting reform in the state that was signed in November timeframe by our governor. That has to be implemented by the Commission. And so, there's some work there. But that could also help from a siting perspective, as we move forward. I would remind you too, within this New Energy Law, we have the opportunity to be outside of Michigan as well in MISO. And so, we're going to look for a lot of \u2013 there's windier states, there's sunnier states, we're going to look for those areas where projects are underway, or there's a good siting opportunity to be able to connect and be able to achieve the clean energy standard as well. As I shared also, when I think forward about this new energy standard, it's a mix, right? Not all ownership, it's not all PPAs, there's probably a blend that makes the most sense. And that's what we're figuring out right now. So that gives us a lot of options. Again, that's the strength of this to be able to find all those important resources, get them all sited and get them constructed.  I would also remind you, last comment, I'm a little long winded here. But there is flexibility in this law. If you're not there exactly in 2030 or 2035, you can get an exception through the Public Service Commission. So that also offers flexibility to be able to achieve these ambitious clean energy goals. Operator : Our final question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Just quickly, I wanted to take the other side of Julien's question. I think you've finished the year slightly under a 15% FFO to debt, potentially get 60 basis points added for the change at Moody's. Any thought? I think the upgrade trigger for you guys at Moody's is 17%. Any thought of maybe achieving that to get an upgrade to your credit rating? Rejji Hayes : It's Rejji. I would just say it's a pretty big lift, I would think, to get mathematically to that 17% or high teens area that Moody's and S&P have guided us toward if we wanted to get an upgrade. And so, that would require in the absence of additional equity, pretty substantial cash flow generation and/or monetization of tax credits. And so, I don't foresee that in the near term or in this vintage of our five year plan.  And I've also just \u2013 observing markets now for what seems like the last 15 to 20 years. It really hasn't been worth the cost of getting to those higher credit rating levels. If you think about the juice being worth the squeeze, just the amount of coupon that you can save by having a higher credit rating has not been worth the cost of all the equity issuances and so on.  We like where we are right now. We think that's the most efficient area from a credit rating perspective, to issue debt. And really, there's no appetite to equitize the balance sheet in a manner that would allow us to get an upgrade. So we feel good where we are is a longwinded way of saying that. Operator : We have no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Garrick for closing remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Emily. And I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today for year-end earnings call. I look forward to seeing you on the road here in the near future. Take care and stay safe. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CMS Energy 2024 First Quarter Results. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 p.m. Eastern Time, running through May 2. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jason Shore, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Jason Shore : Thank you, Drew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. CMS Energy, 21 years of consistent industry-leading results. And what sets us apart is our performance, and it starts with our investment thesis. It is how we prioritize and focus our work to deliver the service our customers deserve in the financial outcomes you expect. As we look ahead, we see ample investment opportunity over the long term as we lead the clean energy transformation and deliver the critical work needed to improve the reliability and resiliency of our electric and gas systems. This important work is supported by legislation and a constructive regulatory environment, which provides confidence in making required investments to strengthen our system and prepare for a clean energy future. We plan ahead through our electric reliability road map, natural gas delivery plan and our upcoming renewable energy plan, which all provide visibility and transparency, and the work will deliver to keep our systems safe, sound and clean. At CMS Energy, we work both sides of the equation. We make important investments in our systems, and we work to keep bills affordable. Our CE Way lean operating system helps us improve our performance, increase productivity and take costs out of the business. And we are hard at work to grow Michigan through economic development, ensuring Michigan thrives well into the future. These efforts are important and help us keep customers' bills affordable. At CMS Energy, we make our investment thesis work year after year, and it continues to set us apart in the industry, delivering results for all our stakeholders. Today, I'm going to share 3 focus areas that have me excited about our future and give us confidence in our outlook. First, our electric distribution system. As our world becomes more dependent on electricity for business growth, technology advancements, devices and vehicles, our system needs to be stronger, smarter and more resilient for our customers. But our vast electric distribution system is aging. It needs to be modernized and strengthened for increasingly severe weather. Over the past 5 years, we have seen some of the highest wind speeds on record in more frequent storm activity. We have responded to this need through our electric reliability road map. Currently, a 5-year $7 billion plan to improve performance and harden our system for the future. The plan utilizes best practices from across the industry, including designing the system with stronger pull, undergrounding, sectionalizing in further automation. And given the size of our distribution system, 90,000 miles of line, nearly 1,200 substations and a historically lower investment per mile compared to peers, we see a long runway of needed investment. We've incorporated roughly half of the incremental $3 billion you see on Slide 4, into our current capital plan, and you'll start to see this investment show up in our next electric rate case, which we'll file in the second quarter. These important investments will mean fewer in shorter outages for our customers, and we are already seeing meaningful improvements in the investments made over the last few years. The second focus area I want to share is our continued leadership of the transformation to clean energy in the industry. In the past, I have shared our approved plans to eliminate coal in 2025, reduce carbon, grow energy efficiency and build out renewables in pursuit of our net zero target and cleaner air for our customers and our planet. In late 2023, much of our clean energy targets were bolstered by Michigan's new clean energy law. This law is unique in the industry and is good for all stakeholders. It provides us with the opportunity to further reduce our carbon footprint while maintaining resource adequacy, affordable customer builds and delivering for our investors. On the right side of the slide, you'll see the opportunities ahead, as we prepare to meet Michigan's new clean energy law. It supports an accelerated plan with the decarbonization of our system. With an enhanced financial compensation mechanism, which provides a roughly 9% return on clean purchase power agreements. In addition, there's an increased incentive on energy efficiency as we target 60% renewables by 2035 and 100% clean energy by 2040. And it gives us important flexibility as we think through how to best meet our customers' needs with renewables across the broad MISO footprint. This mechanism, the flexibility in the law, helps us balance customer affordability as we work through this transition. For our customers, all this means stronger, more resilient and cleaner energy. For our investors, an exciting and robust investment runway well into the future. Now let's work the other side of this investment equation. The third focus area that I want to share today how we are helping Michigan grow and thrive, which is good for our company, and our customers. Growth across our service territory is good for Michigan, helps keep bills affordable for our customers and provides headroom to the investments, I just referenced. And I couldn't be more excited about the growth we need in our state. Michigan has a strong fiber network, access to fresh water, temperate climate, energy-ready site, and attractive energy rate. In February, we secured a contract with a large data center in the heart of our service territory. The majority of the 230 megawatts of new load is expected to be online by 2026. This is nice load growth. And I'm even more excited about the manufacturing load growth we are seeing in Michigan, which is a differentiator for us. Our statewide leadership project such as Gotion, Hemlock Semiconductor, Ford and many others, continues to drive new and expanding load in our service territory. These projects bring significant jobs, supply chain, commercial growth, housing starts and broad Michigan investment. The ancillary benefit of manufacturing growth are good for all customers, can bolster our confidence in our plan for 2024 and beyond. Our customers thrive when Michigan thrives. And I'm proud of the diversity and quality of new load our leadership is working to bring to the state. Now let's get into the numbers. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.97. Although we experienced a warmer-than-normal winter, the healthy set of countermeasures we deployed in 2023 and as well as our active use of the CE Way continued to benefit us in 2024. We remain confident in this year's guidance and long-term outlook and are reaffirming all our financial objectives. Our full year guidance remains at $3.29 to $3.35 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. Longer term, we continue to guide to the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which implies and includes 7% up to 8%. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 7, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the quarter and our year-to-go expectation. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analysis herein are in comparison to 2023, both on a first quarter and 9 months to go basis. In summary, through the first quarter of 2024, we delivered adjusted net income of $288 million or $0.97 per share, which compares favorably to the comparable period in 2023 largely due to higher weather-normalized sales and lower service restoration costs of utility, partially offset by mild weather. To elaborate on the impact of weather, we experienced another warm winter in Michigan during the first quarter, which had the second lowest number of heating degree days in the past 25 years. The warm winter weather resulted in $0.06 per share of negative variance, which appears modest on the surface given the historically low number of heating degree days. However, it's important to note that last year's winter was also quite warm. Rate relief net of investment-related expenses resulted in $0.05 per share of positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved in our most recent electric rate case and last year's gas rate case settlement coupled with residual benefits from our 2023 electric rate case settlement approved last January. From a cost performance perspective, our financials in the first quarter of 2024 were positively impacted by lower operating and maintenance or O&M expenses primarily attributable to lower service restoration costs than we experienced last year. Also, as Garrick noted, we continue to see benefits from select cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2023, which have offset modest inflationary trends we've experienced in various cost categories such as wages, as planned, and we anticipate this trend to continue over the remainder of the year. And our [ catch-all ] category represented by the final bucket in the actual section of the chart, you'll notice a healthy pickup of $0.19 per share, largely driven by weather normalized sales, which contributed almost half of said positive variance, particularly in our residential and commercial customer classes. It's worth noting that the leap year impacts comparability with 2023 for weather-normalized sales, but even absent the effects of the leap year, our residential weather-normalized sales up about 0.5%, and our commercial customer class was up almost 2.5% versus the prior year, which highlights the continued solid performance of our higher-margin customer classes. Looking ahead, we plan for normal weather, as always, which equates to $0.22 per share of positive variance for the remaining 9 months of the year, given the mild temperatures experienced for virtually all of 2023. From a regulatory perspective, we're assuming $0.18 per share of positive variance, which is largely driven by the constructive electric rate order received from the commission in early March. We are also assuming a supportive outcome in our pending gas rate case. On the cost side, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense at the utility driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way, and last year's voluntary separation program, among other 2023 cost reduction initiatives that continue to bear fruit. We also assumed lower service restoration costs given last year's record level of storm activity in our service territory. In aggregate, we expect these items to drive $0.09 per share of positive variance for the remaining 9 months of the year. Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance which largely consists of the absence of select onetime countermeasures from last year and the usual conservative assumptions around weather-normalized sales and nonutility performance among other items. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.52 to $0.58 per share of negative variance. Slide 8 offers the latest updates on our regulatory forward calendar. As you'll note in the top section, we plan to file a Renewable Energy Plan or REP by mid-November, which will highlight our strategy for complying with the various renewable energy targets associated with Michigan's new clean energy law. We are excited by the prospects of the new law, which will support our net zero carbon by 2040 goal and look forward to socializing our filing with key stakeholders in the coming months. Once filed, the commission will have 300 days to issue an order, which will likely be in the third quarter of 2025. Therefore, as mentioned during our fourth quarter call, you should expect to the 5-year plan that will roll out in the first quarter of 2026 will incorporate a greater portion of the financial impacts of the REP. Moving on to our general rate case filings. You can expect our next electric rate case to be filed in late May to early June time frame. This filing will incorporate some of the initial spend we have outlined in our 5-year electric reliability road map that Garrick touched on earlier. Given the 10-month stipulated period for rate cases in Michigan, we would expect to receive an order from the commission in the first quarter of 2025 and thus, the related financial impact. Lastly, we anticipate an order in our pending gas rate case by mid-October, absent a settlement. While we don't always include a balance sheet update on our formal presentation, it is worth noting that Moody's and Fitch reaffirmed our credit ratings in March and April, respectively, as noted at the bottom of the table on Slide 9. Longer term, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings, and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly as we balance the needs of the business. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis is how we run our business and provides us with confidence for a strong outlook this year and beyond. 21 years of consistent industry-leading financial performance, 21 proof point, regardless of conditions, no excuses, just results. With that, Drew, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : I guess, firstly, just given you have an upcoming electric case. How are you thinking about any kind of incremental construct improvements there? Would you kind of seek an expanded IRM framework? And do you need to address any kind of the rate design issues with C&I rates, especially as you're trying to accommodate new load like data center growth, especially just trying to kind of balance that customer rate impact. Garrick Rochow : Shahriar, you want me to get into rate design. You guys are all going to fall asleep on this call if I go into rate design. Let me start out with the fundamentals of this electric case. I think this is really important. You've heard me time and time again, whether it's investor meetings or in our calls and the importance of improving reliability. We've seen higher wind speeds, more frequent storm activity. And just this is our focus as a company, how we improve reliability and the longer-term resiliency of our electric system. You can also hear that from the commissioners. They're very clear about that expectation. And so I would say there's really good alignment there. And this reliability road map does just that. It's aimed at those important capital improvements. There's some O&M work associated with that as well. These are best practices in the industry, which we're deploying across our system and going to a meaningful benefit for our customers. In addition to that, we're focused on the affordability piece. This is how the fundamentals of this, great to invest the capital, but you also have to be focused on the affordability piece for our customers. And so it's driving down unit cost through the CE Way, it's other cost offsets, there's a whole range of things we're doing to make sure this next electric rate case delivers for our customers in terms of improved reliability and offsetting from a cost perspective. So that's the fundamentals of the case. And so we're going to look at different mechanisms in that case. As I've shared before, I would anticipate that we, again, take advantage of our infrastructure recovery mechanism that was supported in the last case. We'll look at a storm recovery mechanism. We've utilized that in previous cases. We'll continue to look at that optionality and what that could look like in this case. Again, longer term, we'll file this in the May, first part of June. I feel confident about what we're putting together based on the important merits of the case that are going to improve reliability, will balance the important components of affordability. Now your question on rate design, there's a lot in rate design. I really will put you to sleep if I go there. We're going to make sure as the state expands, and we have this important load growth that both energy and capacity component, that cost of service mechanism is appropriately allocated to where those costs are. That's what we've done historically. That's what the commission supported. And so we'll look at that certainly within the context of this case, but it's really smaller in the grand scheme of the important work of this case. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. And then lastly, as we're thinking about the energy law construct [indiscernible], I guess, what are some of the first changes you can implement, especially as we're thinking about the upcoming IRP update. Would you lean more on sort of that FCM construct? And is any of this kind of embedded in your long-range growth guidance? Garrick Rochow : It's still early days on some of those modeling. So we'll file our REP, Renewable Energy Plan, on November 15. And as I've shared historically here or previous here, there's a broad spectrum of ownership versus PPAs. PPAs obviously have the opportunity for the financial compensation mechanism or if you're going to build everything and own everything, obviously, you have the opportunity to earn your ROE. So there's a broad spectrum. You do all either end, those are the bookends. I think it's somewhere in the mix, and there's a lot of variables we need to consider that we're modeling out right now, and that's why we're not prepared to share what that looks like. But let me hand it over to Rejji, I know he has some additional thoughts on this. Rejji Hayes : Thanks for the question. All I would add to Garrick's comments is that in our current 5-year plan, what we've incorporated is just a modest amount of PPAs with the financial compensation mechanism, and that's solely because of the fact that any PPA put in place after June of this year would be subject to the new FCM, which is around 9% versus the prior of about 5.5%. And so we have a portion of that, albeit a small portion incorporated in this 5-year plan. We've also incorporated the enhanced economic incentives associated with energy efficiency. And so that's flowing through our plan as well. And remember, historically, we've, on the electric side, been reducing load about 2% year-over-year. And before the new energy law, we get a 20% incentive on top of that spend, that's now 22.5%, so that's also a source of financial upside embedded into this plan. But to Garrick's earlier comments, the much more expansive opportunities, whether it's scaling contracts or the ownership opportunities or more specifically the rate base opportunities. Those are not incorporated into our 5-year plan and really won't be until 2026. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. Appreciate it, Garrick, for the record, your rate design answer was not boring at all. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Nicholas Campanella : I guess just thinking about the other off-site opportunities, can you maybe give us an update on your conversations around DIG and the recontracting opportunity there? And how those discussions have been progressing? Is this something that we can maybe see an update on by year-end? Or is it more a '25, '26 item? Maybe just talk about timing there. Rejji Hayes : Nick, this is Rejji. I appreciate the question. Yes, as we talked about on our fourth quarter call, we still have about 30% to 35% open margin in the outer years of our plan, really starting in sort of 2026 or second half of 2016 going through 2028. We certainly are seeing attractive reverse inquiry for that open margin on the capacity side. We're sold through on the energy side through 2028 or through the duration of this 5-year plan, but there still are opportunities in the capacity side. And we'll be thoughtful. We never are too aggressive in selling down that open margin. We like to have a little bit of optionality, particularly with a really attractive technical that we continue to see in Zone 7 with the tightening of supply and upward pressure on demand. And so we'll provide an update in our next 5-year plan, as we always do. And I expect that we'll be selling down a portion of the open margin ratably over the coming months and quarters, but should still have probably a little open margin as we provide a new 5-year plan in the first quarter next year. Is that helpful? Nicholas Campanella : That is helpful. I appreciate that. And I guess thinking about the rate case cadence and outcomes. On the electric side, the last case to kind of pursue the fully litigated outcome, but on the gas side, you just received staff testimony. And I think, Rejji, I heard you say you get an order in fourth quarter absent a settlement. So just what's your reaction to staff starting point here? And what are your thoughts on being able to settle the gas case? Garrick Rochow : I'd go back Nick to the fundamentals of that case, aiming for a safe natural gas system, you continue to reduce methane across that and deliver affordable natural gas to our customers. And so again, the imbalance -- that equation of making the investments in the natural gas system, also just like we're doing in the electric business, aiming for an improved affordability across the gas system through unit costs, through cost out using the CE Way and the likes. So those fundamentals are true. Staff position, I would categorize as constructive, a constructive starting point. And so we'll look, once we have that position, we're going to look for the opportunity for settlement. We've been able to work with a number of the interveners in the past and have a good track record there. But I also hear this, I'm confident in the testimony and the merits of the case. So if we need to go to full distance, we will, and get a constructive outcome both for our customers and stakeholders. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to dive in, I guess, to the sales outlook, came in a bit better than expected, I guess, for the first quarter and for the balance of the year, it looks like that's trending better than expected. And just wondering by customer class, if you could dive in a bit more on the drivers that you're seeing that within each class that is leading to this uptick? Rejji Hayes : Ye's. Jeremy, this is Rejji. I appreciate the question. So yes, we were pleased with the first quarter performance of non-weather sales. We provide good color on that in our earnings digest, which you probably saw. But going through the customer classes, we saw residential up just under 1.5% versus Q1 of 2023. And so on the surface that looks quite good, but it's important to note that the leap day in the quarter because it's a leap year, drove about 2/3 of that. But still even absent leap day, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, still up about 0.5%. I still think we continue to see continued upside of the return to work or return to facilities trend, where I think we had pretty conservative assumptions about returning to facilities, and we are seeing a stickiness to folks having our corporations retaining what I would describe as a hybrid workforce. And so that is still, I think, delivering some surprise to the upside, and it is a higher margin customer class, as you know. On the commercial side, really quite pleased with what we've seen. And so the number was just under 3.5% increase versus Q1 of 2023. And the leap year only affected about 1/3 of that. So pro forma for the leap year, we were still just under 2.5%. So very pleased with that. And our speculation, we've seen some of the subsectors within commercial that have performed pretty well. Agriculture, mining, up about 6.5%. We also saw entertainment up about 3%. And so we've seen some of the subsectors perform pretty well. But we also think because folks are actually going to the office, at least 3 days a week, that does create foot traffic in communities and folks are going to cafes and things of that nature. So that's also part of it as well, but that's a bit more speculate there, but that's our sense. And then within Industrial, if you exclude one low-margin large customer, we're just over -- sorry, just slightly up, let's say, about 20, 25 basis points, and the leap year did have a big impact on that class. And so pro forma for the leap year, you're down about 1%. I will always caveat 2 things whenever we talk about weather-normalized sales. One, remember, those numbers include the fact that we're reducing our load by 2% each year in electric due to energy efficiency. So all these numbers should be on a gross basis, up 2%. And so you should provide that color to these industrial numbers. The other thing I always caveat is that weather normalization math as good as our team is, as hard as they work to get it right, is a very imperfect science. And so it is very difficult to get these numbers exactly right. But what I would say in terms of industrial that we feel very good, as Garrick noted in his prepared remarks about the economic outlook and just have a robust pipeline and a very diversified pipeline of industrial opportunities, which really aren't reflected in our numbers at this point. It won't be until the outer years of our plan, and we'll be disappointed if that opportunity doesn't continue to bear fruit for the next couple of years. Now that's the color I can offer across each customer class, but certainly happy to take any follow-ups as needed. Jeremy Tonet : That's very helpful. And maybe just pivoting a bit here, it seems on the side that they lay out there's a bit of cushion to hitting the guide in '24. And so just wondering, I guess, how you feel confidence level guide at this point, does it put you in a position to start thinking about '25? Just wanted to get a sense for how that stands. Rejji Hayes : Yes. I would say, Jeremy, early days. Obviously, we're delighted that 2024 is not 2023 in that we don't have a big storm as well as mild weather to start off the year, which we obviously saw last year. But to be clear, we still saw negative variance in terms of weather, top line-related weather. And so there's still some work to do. And so we are countermeasuring and again, very confident in the outlook. But it's a little early before we start thinking about derisking 2025 and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : I was wondering what you're seeing in terms of maybe data center demand in the pipeline. Any uptick in further requests to connect beyond the big kind of megawatt addition that you called out? And wondering if that customer class, I guess, would potentially be involved in the voluntary renewables plan? Any upside potential there? Garrick Rochow : Thanks for your question, David. A couple of things on this. I typically don't like to talk about the pipeline just because it's pretty speculative on that. And many of these data center companies are testing the waters in a variety of different utilities. And so we typically talk in terms of contracts. And when we talk about economic development, whether it's manufacturing or data centers, it's secured contracts, which we, again, feel really good about. Let me reflect a little bit on this project, and then I'll talk -- I will highlight the pipeline. I will get to your answer. This particular project, this data center expansion that we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is 230 megawatts, online by 2025, a majority of the load in place by 2026. And so that does speak to our ability and capabilities to be able to deliver for these customers. And then you see Michigan, and I said this in some of my remarks, temperate climate, which is great for the heating and cooling load of a data center, a lot of freshwater and then energy-ready sites, attractive energy rates, good fiber network, all that comes together to make Michigan really attractive. I will say within the state of Michigan, there is a sales and use tax that exists where there's roughly a dozen states that have the sales and use tax in place, about 6%. There is an exemption process as being a build that are being considered in the House and Senate. It's passed the House in a bipartisan way. It's moved over to the Senate for consideration. We think that's going to move forward, that exemption, probably in the June, July time frame at the end of the session before they go on summer break. And that will open up Michigan a bit more for that pipeline. There are companies that are exploring Michigan right now, large data center providers, names that you would recognize. But again, it's a little bit -- they're testing the water in a lot of different locations. And so we'll see how Michigan progresses. We're certainly an attractive place to do business, and we'll look to track that low growth appropriately. And but as I stated in my previous remarks, we want to make sure there's a good balance that they're picking up the costs associated with that load as well, both from an energy and capacity perspective. So that's all the things that work in the balance, David. Hopefully, that provides some light to your question. Let me know if I didn't strike the right balance there. David Arcaro : It does. That's helpful. Yes. And are you thinking there could be upside to your long-term load growth expectations? Or is it still early? Garrick Rochow : We've got a -- we have -- between the manufacturing load this contract and the data center load that's contracted. As Rejji said, it's a nice piece of load growth that we factored in the later years of this 5-year plan, but future 5-year plans. And we're excited about what that means. And there's a strong pipeline, both from a manufacturing perspective and to a degree, the data center perspective as well. I'd be disappointed if some of those projects in the pipeline didn't materialize. David Arcaro : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And a separate topic. I was wondering you're just latest expectations for the performance-based rates process in terms of timing and where that outcome might be headed. Garrick Rochow : That's progressed in a constructive way. We had close to 10 or a dozen metrics that were originally proposed. It's narrowed to 4 metrics that are benchmarkable and there's good standards. And so again, a constructive process plays out. There's more work to do from our perspective when we filed comments in the February, March time frame. We're expecting a report from the Michigan Public Service Commission staff in May, and so we'll see the next round of thinking. I would suggest that a couple of electric rate cases away, not this case, perhaps the next case before we see implementation. But again, this is an evolving process with the Public Service Commission. Operator : Our next question today comes from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe. Michael Sullivan : Just sticking with the data center conversation, it sounds like you're kind of optimistic on this legislation and if that does pass and start to bring more interest to the state, what do you think about the potential for DIG being used in its entirety as like a behind-the-meter solution for like a larger type data center build-out? I know there's been a lot of focus on that on the nuclear side of things elsewhere, but people talking about gas as well. So just curious of your thoughts there. Garrick Rochow : Similar to Rejji's comments, from an energy perspective, energy tools and a capacity of the bilateral contracts, much of DIG has been spoken for at attractive -- really attractive position that either meets our expectations or is above our expectations. And so there's really unless you're beyond 2028, and maybe in the 2030s decade, DIG's really not available because it's already been secured and with, again, attractive energy tools and bilateral contracts for capacity. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Fair enough. Makes sense. And then just on your upcoming [ audit rate ] case filing here just to set expectations. I know 1 of your peers in the state recently filed and got a pretty quick response from the AG. Are you anticipating something similar with yours? Should we just be prepped for that? Garrick Rochow : It is -- we got primaries in August, and that means early [indiscernible] balance start in June. And so its political season already in Michigan. And so I would anticipate that. Look, the Attorney General participates in all our cases, that's been a historical practice. Sometimes those are more public than other times. We stand, as I shared earlier, by the merits of the case, both in our gas case that's underway right now and this electric rate case. The team just went through a walk through this week, and I couldn't be more proud of the work the team's put together on it. As I shared earlier in my questions or responses to questions, we're focused on reliability. That's going to improve for our customers. That is absolutely the right thing to do, well aligned with the Public Service Commission. We're working hard to create affordability, and we're good at that through the CE Way, the reducing power supply cost, their unit costs from execution of capital. And when you get that mix right, that equation, right, it makes it I mean you get good outcomes. And so I'm excited about this case. It's certainly going to be a step-up in capital. There's going to be some O&M work too, that's focused on reliability, but there's also some offsets that are really exciting that make us -- get me excited, as you can tell by the tone of my voice about what we're filing and what we put it together because it's going to be good for customers, and it's going to be good for all stakeholders. Operator : Our final question comes from Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. Andrew Weisel : Follow up on the rate cases here. Just a couple of follow-ups on the rate cases. So first, I think you just alluded to this to the electric side. You're going to have more capital and more O&M. Just from a headline perspective, should we expect a larger revenue increase request than what we've seen in past [ dialings ] in terms of percent increase to customer bills. Garrick Rochow : Yes. The short answer is yes. But again, important work from a capital investment perspective and reliability, and we've done a lot to offset some of the O&M costs components of this to strike that right balance. And that's what I mean by the important fundamentals or merits of the case. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Very good. And then procedurally on the gas side. I know this case is unique in that there's no ALJ. Does that change the time line at all or the potential for settlement? You talked a bit about settlement, but the lack of ALJs that factor in at all? Garrick Rochow : No. The team seems excited about the opportunity to get to the table. Now that we have staff position now that we know where intervenors are at, to talk settlement. And as I shared, we've been able to navigate that with success in the past with all interveners, all stakeholders. And so we'll look to do that, but also hear my confidence in the merits of the case that if we need to go to full distance, we will. And I know that will get a good outcome for our customers and for stakeholders. Operator : That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll now hand back over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Drew. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you on the road soon. Take care and stay safe. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CMS Energy 2024 Second Quarter Results. The Earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 p.m. Eastern Time running through August 1. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jason Show, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Jason Shore : Thank you, Harry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our proven investment thesis, which delivers 6% to 8% adjusted earnings growth and affordable bills for our customers has been durable for more than two decades because we focus on what matters. Today, I'm going to highlight two key areas of our thesis. First, Michigan's strong regulatory environment. Built on a solid constructive framework, much of which is codified in Michigan law, 10-month forward-looking rate cases, important financial and fuel recovery mechanisms increased energy waste reduction incentives just to name a few attributes. This robust framework supports Michigan's position as a top-tier regulatory environment and provides supportive incentives for needed investments to make our electric and gas systems safer, more reliable and resilient and cleaner. And second, our continued commitment to affordable bills for our customers. As I've said before, we work both sides of the equation. We make important investments and we keep customer build affordable. I consider our use of the CE Way, our lean operating system, one of the best in the industry. This approach limits upward pressure on customer bills. It is critical in the delivery of our investment plan. And we continue to see a long runway of cost-saving opportunities well into the future, delivering industry-leading results for all our stakeholders. From a regulatory perspective, we're off to a strong start for the year. As you can see on Slide 4, our regulatory calendar is mostly complete. We received a constructive order in our electric rate case in March, filed our new electric rate case in May and settled our gas rate case earlier this month, the fourth consecutive settlement in our gas business, four consecutive settlements in gas, yet another proof point highlighting the strong regulatory environment in Michigan. We're very pleased with our recently approved gas settlement, which calls for a $62.5 million of effective rate relief, a 9.9% ROE and a 50% equity ratio. We plan to follow our next gas rate case in December of this year. Outside of rate cases, our upcoming 20-year renewable energy plan or our EP filing in November is the only major remaining filing for the year. Let me pause there for a moment. Midway through the year. our financial-related regulatory outcomes are known. This is a great place to be. I also want to talk about our formula to deliver customer affordability as we make important investments. Long-term filings, like our renewable energy plan detail the significant planned investments that support safe, reliable, clean and affordable energy for our customers. As we shared previously, we see more investment opportunities as we make the transition to renewables and clean energy. In addition to the $17 billion of needed customer investments in our 5-year capital plan, our electric reliability road map and natural gas delivery plans highlight important investments well beyond within our financial plan. Now that's a long way of saying we see a long runway of necessary and important customer investments. These investments must be balanced with a laser focus on customer affordability. We take seriously our ability to create capital headroom to make those investments through continued use of the CE Way, which provides over $50 million of annual customer savings. Renegotiating over market PPAs in retiring our coal facilities, which together provide well over $200 million in savings as we transition toward cleaner resources. Capitalizing on economic development opportunities, particularly in manufacturing, which brings jobs and significant mission investments, spreading fixed costs over a larger customer base, benefiting all customers. Lastly, leveraging our best-in-class energy waste reduction programs to help customers reduce bills. This is a formula that works for everyone, continuing to strengthen the system with important investments while keeping customer bills affordable. Now let's look at the results and outlook. For the first half, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.63, up $0.18 versus the first half of 2023, largely driven by the constructive outcomes in our electric and gas rate cases. We remain confident in this year's guidance and long-term outlook and are reaffirming all our financial objectives. Our full year guidance remained at $3.29 to $3.35 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. Longer term, we continue to guide toward the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which implies and includes 7% up to 8%. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 7, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the first six months of 2024 and our year ago expectations. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analysis herein are in comparison to 2023, both on a year-to-date and a year-to-go basis. In summary, through the first half of 2024, we delivered adjusted net income of $485 million or $1.63 per share, which compares favorably to the comparable period in 2023, largely due to higher rate relief net of investment costs. And while we have seen some glimpses of favorable weather, particularly in June, overall weather continues to be a headwind through the first half of the year, equating to $0.05 per share of negative variance and that figure includes the warm winter weather experience in our service territory in the first quarter, which I'll remind you, have the second lowest number of heating degree days in the past 25 years. As mentioned, rate relief, net investment-related expenses, one of the key drivers of our first half performance resulted in $0.13 per share of positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved in our electric rate order received in March and last year's gas rate case settlement. From a cost perspective, our financial performance in the first half of the year was negatively impacted by heavy storm activity, including a notable weather system that impacted our service territory in late June resulted in $0.03 per share, a negative variance versus the comparable period in 2023. Rounding out the first six months of the year, you'll note the $0.13 per share of positive variance highlighted in the catch-off bucket in the middle of the chart. The primary sources of upside here were related to solid operational performance at NorthStar and higher weather-normalized electric sales. Looking ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.20 per share of positive variance for the remaining half of the year, given the mild temperatures experienced in the final six months of 2023. From a regulatory perspective, we'll realize $0.12 per share of positive variance, largely driven by the aforementioned electric rate order received from the commission earlier this year and the constructive outcome achieved in our recently approved gas rate case settlement, which Garrick summarized earlier. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q1 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense at the utility driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way and the residual benefits from select sustainable cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2023 such as our voluntary separation plan, among others. Collectively, we expect these items to drive $0.09 per share, a positive variance for the remaining six months of the year. Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance, which largely consists of the absence of select onetime countermeasures from last year and the usual conservative assumptions around weather-normalized sales and nonutility performance among other IOs. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.35 to $0.41 per share of negative variance. In summary, despite a challenging first half of the year, we are well-positioned to deliver on our 2024 financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. Moving on to our financing plan. Slide 8 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2024, which at this point are limited to debt issuances at the utility. I'll bring to your attention a relatively modest increase to our 2024 planned financing of the utility. Specifically, we are now planning to issue approximately $675 million in the second half of the year versus the implied estimates in our original guidance of $500 million to rebalance the rate-making capital structure at the utility in accordance with recent rate case outcomes. Although not highlighted in the table on the slide, I'm pleased to report that we have completed all of our planned tax credit sales for the year at levels favorable to our plan and ahead of schedule. I'll also reiterate that we have no planned long-term financings as apparent in 2024, but remain opportunistic should we see a cost-efficient opportunity to pull ahead some of our 2025 financing needs. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances to the benefit of our customers and investors, and this year is no different. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Rejji. CMS Energy, 21 years of consistent industry-leading financial performance. I have confidence in our strong outlook this year and beyond as we continue to execute on our simple investment thesis, and make the necessary and important investments in our system while maintaining customer affordability. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to turn towards DIG for a little bit here if we could. And just wanted to get updated thoughts with regards to recontracting overall and just, I guess, the outlook in this environment, given kind of trends in power prices? Garrick Rochow : I would suggest, Jeremy, it's consistent with what we shared in the past, energy and capacity markets that upward pressure continues to be a ripe opportunity and we continue to strike nice bilateral contracts to secure managing capacity prices well above our plan. And so again, it's a good opportunity to continue to do that. And as we've shared in the past, this just continues to strengthen and lengthen our financial performance. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thank you for that. And then it seems like halfway through the year, CMS is in a pretty good position overall. Just wondering any thoughts, you could share with regards to, I guess, how weather is looking in impacts for 3Q as it stands right now and really getting towards, I guess, cost management thoughts and whether there might be in a position to pull forward costs to further derisk the future outlook and how you think about all of that? Rejji Hayes : Jeremy, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question. I would say weather outlook looks fairly good for Q3, but obviously, early days. And I will just say, personally, I don't give a lot of credence to 2-month and 3-month outlooks. I'm much more focused on the 10 days ahead, which appear to be a bit more accurate. And so, we always remain paranoid about weather. And just based on year-to-date, weather has not been all that kind. And so, we'll continue to execute on cost performance-related initiatives. We've had some good success over the last several years in executing on cost management over the course of the year, and we'll continue to do that through Q3. As I mentioned in the first quarter call, it's still premature to start thinking about pull aheads for 2025. I'd say historically, even in the best of years, where weather was really helpful in the first couple of quarters, we still didn't think about flexing up or pull ahead or any of those types of derisking mechanisms until we got deeper into Q3 and had a real good outlook on the fourth quarter. So hopefully, more to talk about from a 2025 derisking perspective next quarter. But at this point, it's too premature to get into that. Garrick Rochow : And if I could just add to that, Jeremy, part of the call here in my prepared remarks, I talked about the confidence. Confidence comes from the fact that we're executing on the CE Way. We've done that historically. We typically have been at a run rate of greater than $50 million on an annual basis. We see that continuing. There are a number of things that we did in 2023 in terms of -- already Ready shared in his prepared remarks, voluntary separation, contract control as those continue to yield benefit in the year. And also, we're flying a lot of digital solutions, everything from work in the field to automate work, all the way into the office, things like work management that continue to provide additional cost savings in the year. So again, confident as I shared in the call here earlier, and delivering guidance for the year. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Appreciate it. And then if I could just wrap with thoughts on opportunity to service data centers going forward here, and I guess, the interplay with regards to legislation in Michigan, whether that comes to fruition and how that might impact the pace of such type of development. Garrick Rochow : Jeremy, you know us well enough the Hayes-Rochow team here. We're pretty conservative in our approach to financials. And as I shared in the Q1 call, we want to make sure it's signed on the dotted line, you might say, before we talk about it. So, we don't inflate our sales forecast. I would just say that there's a lot of interest in both manufacturing and data centers in the state as I shared in the Q1 call, seeing a lot of manufacturing growth. That continues into Q2. We saw data centers, we talked about one that we signed in Q1, 230 megawatts. There continues to be strong interest in the state, both the hyperscalers and also, we're seeing some growth in what I call, midscalers from a data center perspective, those continue to move forward regardless of legislation in the state. And so, the sales and use tax piece will continue in the conversation in the legislature. But again, it's a bit of Jerry on top of Sunday, you might say. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Shahriar Pourreza : So, I know you guys noted previously that the FCM mechanism could be incremental sort of in the new generation not in plan. As we're kind of getting closer to the November rep filing, any thoughts on where demand is headed and how maybe CMS would be positioned for upside there. So, any thoughts on incremental CapEx versus the PPA options? Have you started to embed any higher load growth in your assumptions? Garrick Rochow : Sure. I was really hoping for a rate design question. Shahriar Pourreza : It's coming. That's my follow-up. Garrick Rochow : Let's talk about this. We definitely see as a part of this energy law, additional upside. That shows up in ownership of asset that shows up in the financial compensation mechanism, both those are true. Let me talk about how they'll play out, though. We're going to file this our renewable energy plan in November, it's a 10-month process. So, we'll know in 2025, kind of latter half of the year, what that looks like. And so, in our 2026 capital plan, you'll see what that means, our 2026 financials both from an FCM perspective as well as what might the ownership mix looks like. And so that's where it will play out. In addition to that, that's probably a portion of the story because in 2026, we'll also file our integrated resource plan, which we'll talk about some of the reliability pieces and some of the work to deliver the capacity component of that. So, between '26, '27, '28, I think that's when you'll see the capital impact as well as the financial compensation mechanism play out in terms of our financials. And I will say this, we've seen some good economic growth in the state. That will show up in our renewable energy plan. We're definitely seeing a greater need than was in our original 2021 IRP. So, I'll leave it at that. And certainly, that will provide additional upside opportunity in terms of capital growth in addition to the energy law. Shahriar Pourreza : And then just a quick follow-up, and I obviously dedicate this to Garrick. Just on the rate case filing on the electric side, obviously, it's in the early innings. It's kind of more of a '25 event. The provisions and sort of the mechanisms like the IRM and DR remain unchanged. I guess do you feel there would be sort of an opportunity for settlement after testimony given this is kind of a less complex case. I guess, how are you sort of thinking about settlement path versus the prior litigated path? And is there anything, and I dedicate this to you, any of the rate design stuff in there that can cause some contention? Garrick Rochow : I set myself up for that one, didn't I? [indiscernible] here on this call. I will always look for settlement opportunities. I'm also very confident in our team. We put a great case together, and we can go to full distance, just as we did this year in our March order. And so, when I think about this electric rate case, there's some things that have to be figured out to really get some context around the opportunity for settlement. One, I think it's really important to understand that electric cases are more complex than gas cases. So, for example, we had less than 10 intervenors in our gas case. We have a little over 20 in our electric case. That's not abnormal, it's just, it's a more complex case. There's more interested party so we have to navigate through that. I also think it's important to find where staff is and where the Attorney General are at in this case. That will come in September. These are important points to know in the context of settlement opportunity. But I understand that, I am very confident in this case. It is focused on electric reliability. That's well aligned with what the customers are asking for, what the commissioners and the staff are asking for and what I've committed to do and so this case has great capital investments and undergrounding has important work hardening the system and automated transfer reclosures technology on the system. There's important work in O&M and tree trimming, our number one cause of outage and other important maintenance work across the system. We're going to leverage the infrastructure recovery mechanism, we'll certainly look for -- we're going to try another store mechanism in this case as well. And so, we feel confident in our ability to get the very constructive outcome, just given how well aligned we are across commission staff as well as our customers. So hopefully, that gives you some context on the case. Now on rate design, let me just talk a little bit about rate design. Specifically, data centers are not at our economic development rate. We had ex-parte filing that made an adjustment in that, that was approved. And so, in the meantime, they are an industrial rate. We thought our GDP rate and what that does is a better balance, both capacity and energy cost, the cost to serve those customers. The commission as well as the utility has been looking and exploring at the opportunity specific data center rate. But in the interest of time, the GDP is a good proxy for that in our mind. And so well suited from a rate design perspective, from a data center perspective. I also said GDP, I think that's the wrong thing. I was hoping for something different there. Maybe that was -- but GPD is what I meant -- sorry about that Shahriar I had my eyes on the economic [indiscernible] it's election time. I have my mind on other things like what's going to happen with our economy. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Michael Sullivan of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Sullivan : I just wanted to go back to the data center legislation discussion. I think on the last call, you talked about a 230-megawatt data center coming in 2026. Was that contingent on the legislation or your understanding is still moving forward? And are there any other examples of that? Or is everyone else [indiscernible] weighted inflation? Garrick Rochow : It was not contingent. That one is still moving forward, that's the signed piece. And that's -- I guess that's my point. What we hear from data centers, it's more important about how fast can you get transmission here, how much cash can you build that conversion from transmission distribution to substation, how fast can you get supply here, and we're able to do that. And so many of those mid scalers and hyperscalers continue to make forward steps regardless of the progress on the sales new stack. And just to give you a little context, at the end of the spring session, the legislature was focused on the state budget. In the words of our governor, we've got to fix the damn road, and we got to fund schools, right? And so those are important things, too. I don't want -- we want smart kids in the state. So those are important things underway. That conversation on data centers and the sales tax will continue into the fall. Now we're in elections. So, it will be difficult for me to predict how fast that will move or it could happen to [indiscernible]. And so, we'll continue that conversation in the state. But again, it's not stopping things for moving forward, Michael. Michael Sullivan : And is that like a good proxy for how long it takes new load to come on to your system about two years with that one being 2026? Garrick Rochow : There's a number of variables there, Mike. So, in the case of that data center, what we talked about is they're bringing on load by 2025, 2026, and where they're located on the system makes a big difference. And so able to accommodate that. Depending on where the data center is located from a property perspective makes a difference. Just as far as how far do we have to extend lines, is it greenfield? there's all kinds of variables that go into it, but we're in that two to three years cycle. And again, even if you're at the tail end of that cycle, data centers are moving quickly, and that doesn't seem to be holding them up too much. Michael Sullivan : Okay great. And then separately, just kind of sticking with legislation. I think there were some comments a few months ago from the PSC chair about rate case time lines being a bit impressed these days. Are you hearing any chance of legislation coming up that would revert back to 12 months per cycle from -- and just a general sense for rate fatigue in the state in light of those comments? Garrick Rochow : The short answer is no. As you know, what makes Michigan great is much of the regulatory environment is set in law. So, 10-month forward-looking rate cases is in the law, financial compensation mechanism, energy efficiency incentives are in the law. And we just went through that law. We just opened and it was just signed here last November, and we're hearing nothing in terms of holding that law back up or looking at different traditions. Now we continue to always have a constructive dialogue with the commission and the staff. And so, I do think there are opportunities right, in terms. And so, I'll give you one example, just one example of probably many you could think about. We have a great process for an integrated resource plan and a renewable energy plan that lay out an energy supply portfolio. So, we get it preapproved and then it flows into rate cases. It really streamlines rate cases. What if we could do the same thing on the distribution system, wouldn\u2019t that be great? Let's build a 5-year reliability road map. Wait, we've already done that. Let's do that. Let's approve that and then have that flow into rate cases. That could really streamline the process. And it's done in the right way, you can potentially see a path where you could stay out for a period of time, again, done in the right way. And so, the kind of the nature of Michigan's constructive regulatory environment, let's explore that. Let's see if there's opportunities there to -- even for the bolstered Michigan constructive nature. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Andrew Weisel of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Weisel : Just two quick ones. First, C&I weather-adjusted volumes were down in the quarter, it's a bit of a reversal from the first quarter. I know the first quarter was extremely mild weather. So those numbers are probably a little bit goofy. But any commentary on the underlying trends and the near-term outlook for the rest of this year, maybe early thoughts on 2025? Rejji Hayes : Sure, Andrew. This is Rejji. I'll take, and I appreciate the question as always. Yes, we did see a little bit of a pullback in Q2 versus Q2 of last year for weather normalized sales for electric. I will always caveat and I think you alluded to it that it's a very imperfect science, and the team does a really good job trying to pull these numbers together with real accuracy. But again, it's very difficult to get real precision here. Just so everybody is grounded residential for the quarter versus Q2 of 2023, which is slightly up about 0.1%. And commercial down about 1 point, industrial down about 2 points, excluding on low-margin customer and an all-in blended was down about 1 point and so that is to your comment, unfavorable from the trends we were seeing in the first quarter. But I would say, on a year-to-date basis, the trend remains quite good, and we continue to be surprised for the upside really across all customer classes because our assumptions were incredibly conservative as they always are for the year. And so, we are outperforming across every customer class, what our initial expectations were that were embedded in our original guidance. And so, we are still seeing non-weather sales upside. I'll also note, as I've said before, that we had energy waste reduction incorporated into all of those numbers that you're seeing. And so, you should always add 2% to each of those customer classes because we're delivering the 2% reduction across every customer class year-over-year, and we've been doing that now really since the '08 law or thereabouts. And so, another way to think about those numbers I just quoted that you should add or gross up 2% across each of those, if you want to get the underlying economic conditions. So, we still remain quite good. And then we still remain quite pleased rather with the results. And then when you think about it on a year-to-date basis, where is up about 1 point. Commercial is up over 1%, industrial down about 1 point and all in is up about a little over 0.5%. So again, all things considered, particularly when you gross up for energy waste reduction, we think conditions in Michigan remain quite good really across all customer classes. Was that helpful? Andrew Weisel : Yes. Good reminder on the efficiency. And yes, we all know that you're conservative. Next, an operational question. You noted there was some heavy storm activity in the quarter, what kind of score or grade would you give yourself in terms of restoration efforts? Reliability is obviously a big focus for you. You talked about that in your comments, what would you say went well? What could have gone better? And how does this fold into your efforts as part of the electric rate case and the audit? Garrick Rochow : So, we're seeing a number of great improvements as a result of the investments we have made to date. More needs to be done along those lines. And so, in fairness, I'd give ourselves a B in the context, there's more needs to be done for our customers. And that's evident in the rate case filing that we're doing. Where we've worked a lot, this year is reducing the size of the outage. And so, we've put in a lot of fusing. So, what I mean by that is you have less customers impacted when the tree comes down the line, that's an important work. We've more than doubled our free trimming work over the last three years. That's also provided a benefit when we trim treating there, we see a greater than 60% reduction in the number of outages. You may ask why not 100% because we still see trees outside the right way that impacts our performance. But I would also put it into context, Rejji talked about the last week of June, and there was a larger event in June, but there was a lot more smaller events which we would anticipate. We're trying to shrink the size, which makes restoration easier, but a lot of pockets throughout the state. We brought in a number of resources. We leverage a lot of our existing union resources to be able to respond to that, and we have good response from that perspective. We measure in terms of restoring our customers within a 24-hour window. We want to have all customers restored within a 24-hour window. And last year, in 2023, we're at 90% within a 24-hour window. This year, we're upwards of 95%. And so that shows the directional improvement. Now the year is not done. We've got a lot of work to do. and we'll continue to make some important investments throughout this year. And again, this electric rate case shows the path for more. So hopefully it gives us some context. I know Rejji wants to add to it as well. Rejji Hayes : Andrew, all I would add to Garrick's good comments on the operational side is really applying a financial lens. And I would give us about a B+ on the financial side because through utilization of the CE Way, we've done a really good job reducing unit cost in our actual service restoration. And we're seeing at this point over $40 million of avoided costs. Now needless to say, I talked about negative variance attributable to overall service restoration costs versus last year. However, the cost would have been decidedly higher as in the problem-solving we've done throughout the year. And so, we're contracting third parties more efficiently. We're using more automation to reduce manual inspections and definitely leveraging the tools of the CE Way to really execute on storm restoration much more efficiently than we have in the past. And so, in addition to all the operational feat that Garrick highlighted, will also apply a really thoughtful financial lens as well as to make sure that we're bringing customers back online as quickly as possible and as quickly as possible and as cost efficiently as possible. So, I'd be remiss if I didn't add that as well. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Julian Dimelo Smith [Indiscernible] of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Garrick, what are you put in your -- when are you putting yourself in the ring here for VP given all the political conversation here, right? Now you want to fix them growth. Garrick Rochow : And here's Rochow. I don't know. I don't know if it has a ring to it. Look I'll give it a try. Unidentified Analyst : Anyway, I -- look, you guys are really -- you got your front foot forward here for sure. Look, you favorably have pulled back on O&M savings here you're talking about leaning in, being in a good position against near-term and longer-term targets you issued more debt, I think it was $675 million versus the $500 million to rebalance your equity ratio. What's driving this level of outperformance? But I just want to try to clarify like the debt signaling as well as just overall the commentary, especially considering the O&M factor that you flag here. Like typically, you lead with costs, but I'm wondering what other factors there are. Rejji Hayes : Julian, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question and welcome back. Really good to hear your voice. Let me start with a few of the just premises or working assumptions you offered up in the question. And so, let me start with the debt at the utility, just for factual purposes. And so, we are planning to issue about $675 million in the second half of the year at the utility as part of our financing plan. It was initially $0.5 billion and so we've slightly increased, and that's really just because of our rate case outcomes, which had modestly lower equity levels, and so we'll have more debt at the operating company. And so, I just want to make sure that, that was abundantly clear. And obviously, we'll look to execute on that financing as cost-efficiently as possible, and we'll be thoughtful about maturity profile as well. The outperformance has been, obviously, we always try to deliver on the cost performance side. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, rate relief net of investments has been helpful getting constructive orders the electric rate order in early March, the gas rate case last year, we're still seeing the residual benefits from that. And so that's really what's helped us in the first half of the year. And also, though it's embedded in that catch-all bucket, as I noted in my prepared remarks, NorthStar has really outperformed. They had a really soft comp in the first half of 2023, just given last year's plan was a bit more back-end loaded. And there were also some outage-related issues at DIG, given a transformer issue. And so, this year, they've really gotten out of the gate pretty strong. DIG is up about $0.05 year-over-year, and we're seeing the residual benefits from some solar projects that came in late last year. And so, I'd say it's a combination of rate relief net of investments, outperformance at NorthStar as well as some cost performance, as you alluded to, offset by mild weather conditions, which have hurt the top line as well as storms, as we talked about in the prior question. So, I'd say it's a combination of all of that, which gives us just good confidence going into the second half of the year. Unidentified Analyst : And Rejji, just to follow-up on that real quick. A lot of that dynamic with NorthStar, some of it is true up there. You talk about outages year-over-year. You should -- in theory, some of that should have been expected, the solar in service mean I'm curious, the outperformance here. I mean, is this more of a true-up? Or is there sort of a compounding effect across the subsequent years? How do you think about the leading indicators there? Rejji Hayes : Yes, good question. NorthStar on plan. We anticipated a front-end loaded year for all of the reasons you noted. So, a good portion of NorthStar's performance was on plan. But I will say DIG did surprised a little bit to the upside in the first quarter because operationally, not only are they executing very well, but they're also executing on a lower unit cost basis, which drives a little bit of additional margin there also opportunities for off-peak margin that the team has capitalized on. So, I'd say it's a combination of being on plan because it was a front-end loaded plant at NorthStar, but also so operational efficiency, which we've seen. So that's really the thrust of it at NorthStar. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Durgesh Chopra of Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just -- all my other questions have been answered. I just wanted to see if there's an update on the performance-based ratemaking dotted here coming out of the legislation last year. Where do we stand there? Can you just update us on that, please? Garrick Rochow : Sure. That's been a very constructive dialogue. As I've shared in the past, it started really wide in the number of metrics. And then through good dialogue, it was narrowed down to a nice four benchmarkable metrics. It's grown a little bit to accommodate some storm provisions. However, there's still a constructive dialogue underway here in July and August, there's filings to be able to navigate that. There's a few things we still want to work through and get -- Dot the Is and Check the Ts on you might say. And then I expect that this is going to play out over several rate cases. And so, it's not going to be implemented here immediately. I think it just speaks to the constructive dialogue we have in Michigan here. A lot of good interveners and filings that go back and forth to really make sure it's going to be a productive ratemaking mechanism. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. So just kind of the framework of this would be a potential earnings uplift. And then on the downside, a potential penalty on certain metrics. And then when did you say this could go into effect? This is a '25 Item, '26? Just any thoughts there? Garrick Rochow : I would put it several rate cases away, so over maybe a year or two years out from an implementation perspective. Again, that's my view, just what I see of the world. The intent is for it to be symmetric. And so, there's upside opportunity and downside opportunity. The downside opportunity is market about $10 million at this context, which is manageable in the context of the year. That means the upside opportunity is roughly that same amount. And at least that is proposed currently. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from the line of Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Travis Miller : Very high level on electric demand. I wonder if you could elaborate on how it's trending versus your 2021 IRP and how, as you had mentioned earlier in the call, how that would affect potentially the renewable energy plan filing here. They're trending higher or lower and how does that impact the REP? Garrick Rochow : Yes. It's definitely trending higher based on all the economic development activity that is, again, not speculating on that, that is signed or -- and we're out building substations and there's transmission being built to serve these customers. And so, in our renewable energy plan filing, you should anticipate that there's additional sales reference there above and beyond our 2021 IRP. Travis Miller : And is it fair to make the leap then that you would need more renewable energy on that same percentage basis as what's in the lot? Garrick Rochow : Yes, generally speaking. Travis Miller : Okay. And then also, obviously, a lot to talk about in the media about Palisades. From your perspective, is it accurate that you're seeing development moving forward on that plant? And then if so, would you be interested in either implementing that in your plan in terms of the capacity and energy and/or signing a PPA? Garrick Rochow : Palisade is making forward progress in the state. From a state budget perspective, another $150 million was allocated toward the forward direction of the facility. We're having public meetings that are going on right now on site. So again, forward steps and moving forward that plant. Now I remind you that a PPA has already been struck for the offtake from the Palisades facility that goes to a co-op in Michigan and a co-op in Indiana. So, it's already spoken for. Now we did -- it's good for Michigan that Palisade is returning. And we, at CMS Energy, do not see any adverse impact as a result of Palisade coming back. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Nick Campanella of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nick Campanella : Just one for me today. So, I know, Rejji, you said you would be opportunistic in your prepared remarks around financing and potentially pulling things forward from '25. I'm just cognizant that you do have kind of you start to issue equity in 2025. And maybe you can just kind of give us some more color? Are you just kind of talking about pulling forward hybrid or debt or is everything on the table, how do you think about that? Rejji Hayes : Yes, I appreciate the question, Nick. I would say in short, I wouldn't say everything is on the table. So, you won't see us issuing equity in 2024. We have done in the past, though, as we have executed on forward opportunistically to at least take some of the price risk off the table. And I would say where the equity is today. I don't think that seems like the most likely trade. But I was speaking more towards parent debt financing needs. And certainly, our thinking is quite expensive, everything from senior notes to hybrids and those types of securities, all of which we've done pretty opportunistically in the past. As you may recall, we've got about $250 million coming due at the holdco next year. And so, we're mindful that we have, I'd say, modest new money needs on top of that. And so, we will see if there's good pricing in the market, particularly if the speculation around potential dovish policy -- dovish monetary policy from the Fed comes to fruition, but I have stopped wagering on that. So, we'll see what happens. But if we start to see a correction in the yield curve that's favorable and it creates opportunities for holdco debt financings. We'll look to do that. And again, I'd say the equity need still as is up to $350 million starting next year, and I don't see us pulling any of that forward. Operator : With no further questions in the queue at this time, I would like to hand the call back to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Harry. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you on the road soon. Take care, and stay safe. Operator : This concludes today's conference.

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions]. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 :00 p.m. Eastern Time running through November 7. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jason Shore, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Jason Shore : Thank you, Harry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. And now, I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. At CMS Energy, we deliver year-over-year for all stakeholders. We do that through our investment thesis. This is simple but powerful model coupled with our disciplined execution sets us apart in the industry and has delivered more than two decades of industry-leading financial performance. Typically, I walk through that investment thesis. But today, I want to offer three differentiators at CMS Energy providing confidence and visibility as we continue to strengthen and lengthen our 6% to 8% EPS growth. First, Michigan's clean energy law. This law is great for our customers, the planet, and our investors. It ensures we have the right legislation in place to move from coal to clean, providing certainty for the investments we need to make in renewable energy and it gives us the flexibility to either own the assets or utilize a power purchase agreement doing what is best for our customers. Now, here's what's unique. Earning a financial compensation mechanism approximately 9% on a power purchase agreement, no other state that I'm aware of has this provision and then add to it requirements for battery storage and an increased incentive on energy efficiency. There is a lot in this law, very little of which is in our five-year investment plan, providing a strong tailwind and we believe we can do this important work affordably for our customers. The flexibility in the law that allows for ownership or power purchase agreements both within Michigan and outside of Michigan provides more options for customers and ensures we can utilize lower cost energy. Furthermore, it provides us the ability to replace existing, outdated, and above market power purchase agreements with new renewable assets, which keeps costs affordable for customers. Our 20-year renewable energy plan or REP that we'll file next month will detail our clean energy investments and plans to achieve the targets set by Michigan's clean energy law. This filing will show the renewable assets needed above and beyond our 2021 integrated resource plan as well as the additional renewable assets needed to meet increasing sales demand and growth in the state. As I shared before, Michigan's clean energy law is great for all stakeholders. It provides the flexibility we need to find the most cost effective clean energy for our customers. The second item I want to highlight is our commitment to customer reliability. I'm very proud of the comprehensive plan we have laid out in our five-year $7 billion electric reliability roadmap. This plan details our actions to move to second quartile reliability performance or SAIDI by the end of the decade through targeted investments in our electric grid, needed investments for our customers because we have recorded some of Michigan's highest wind speeds over the last five years. We are seeing more frequent storm activity. This plan is deliberate and comprehensive and improves reliability in the short-term and built in long-term resiliency and it does it proactively versus reactively. This plan means we will begin serious efforts to underground more of our distribution wires, better align with Midwest peers, and replace more than 20,000 poles with those designed for more extreme weather. It also means investing in grid technology for more automation and machine learning to speed up restoration in weather events. We're also one of the first utilities East of the Mississippi is file a comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan, which lays out the investments needed to prepare for climate change. These customer investments are based on Electric Power Research Institute, EPRI best practices and will bolster our distribution system to a level of performance our customers expect, particularly as the economy continues to electrify. And our plans have been supported. I am pleased with the recent outcomes from the Michigan Public Service Commission and the Liberty storm audit, which highlights the vastness of our system, the billions of dollars and decades needed to improve it and the importance of these strategic investments. And our customary benefit when we improve the system proactively versus reactively, making these investments in the system now means we can do it at a 40% to 70% lower cost compared to when we do this work following an outage. Better service, lower customer cost, this is a great story. The third point I want to make today is the nice tailwind of economic development we are seeing in our service area. I'm excited and encouraged about the true renaissance underway in Michigan. The big story across the industry is sales growth brought by data centers. We're seeing the same and we're happy to talk more about data centers. Our story is different and in my opinion, better. In Michigan, we are seeing a manufacturing renaissance bolstered by onshoring, unique state attributes, and the inflation reduction and the CHIPS and Science Act. And we love manufacturing growth because it brings jobs, supply chains, commercial activity, housing starts and residential growth where there is greater benefit for the state. We recently updated this slide to highlight several new and diversified examples. Corning expanding and investing up to $900 million and bringing nearly 1,100 jobs to the state, this is the sort of growth we like to see significant Michigan investment in job growth. Saab has expansion plans for an integration and assembly facility. Saab is new to the state but adding to the nearly 4,000 businesses engaged in defense and aerospace work in Michigan. Two new examples among many that speak to the diversified manufacturing growth we are realizing over 700 megawatts of signed contracts in 24 months and growing. Our economic development pipeline continues to look promising with over 6 gigawatts of load looking to either move to or expand in our state, 60% of which is manufacturing. As I mentioned earlier, our renewable energy plan will conservatively reflect our updated load growth forecast based on the strong economic development tailwind we are experiencing. We work hard every day to win our customers business and we are honored when businesses see the value in investing in our state and our service territory. So let's take a look at the regulatory calendar for the year. As I shared last quarter, our financial related regulatory outcomes are known for the year given the constructive March electric rate order in the approved gas rate case settlement. This positions us well as we navigate the last quarter of 2024. Gas rates were effective October 1 and we plan to file our next gas rate case in December of this year. In our current electric rate case, we saw a constructive starting position by staff. We saw support for further underground, wildfire mitigation, and the continuation of the investment recovery mechanism. I do want to point out that the mechanism for storm recovery and the investments outlined in the electric rate case and in the Liberty storm audit are important for our customers. That probably goes without saying. However, it may require that we go to a fully adjudicated order to get the best outcome for our customers. Know that we are confident with where we are in the process, the quality of our filing, and the proactive nature of the investments we are making to improve reliability for our customers. If we go the full distance, we expect the order in March of 2025. Now, let's spend a moment on the results. For the first nine months, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.47, up $0.41 versus the same period in 2023, largely driven by the constructive outcomes in our electric and gas rate cases. Given our confidence in the year, we are reaffirming all our financial objectives, including this year's guidance range of $3.29 to $3.35 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. We are initiating our full year guidance for 2025 at $3.52 to $3.58 per share, reflecting 6% to 8% growth off the midpoint of this year's range. And we are well-positioned, just like 2024, to be toward the high end of that range. It is important to remember that we always rebase guidance off our actuals on the Q4 call, compounding our growth. This brings you a higher quality of earnings and differentiates us from others in the sector. And like we've done in previous years, we'll provide a refresh of our five-year capital and financial plans on the Q4 call. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 9, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the first nine months of 2024 and our year-to-go expectations. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analyses herein are in comparison to 2023 both on a year-to-date and a year-to-go basis. In summary, through the third quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $736 million or $2.47 per share, which compares favorably to the first nine months of 2023, largely due to higher rate relief, net of investment costs, and solid performance at Northstar. From a weather perspective, the third quarter offered favorable weather versus the prior year to the tune of $0.10 per share, largely due to a warm September. The strong third quarter weather for the electric business more than offset the mild weather experience in the first half of the year, thus equating to $0.05 per share of positive variance year-to-date. As mentioned, rate relief net of investment costs, one of the key drivers of our year-to-date performance resulted in $0.18 per share of positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved on our electric rate order received in March and the residual benefits of last year's gas rate case settlement. From a cost perspective, our year-to-date financial performance was largely driven by lower service restoration expense despite a sizable weather system that impacted our service territory in early August. Our favorable variance in this regard has been fueled in large part by cost efficiencies in our storm response efforts. In fact, even though our volume of outages has increased by approximately 10% in 2024 versus the comparable period last year, our restoration cost per interruption has decreased by over 10%, all while restoring customers at a faster rate than the prior year. These achievements and our storm response efforts are just another example of our lean operating system, the CE Way, driving daily productivity in the business. Quite simply, our workforce uses the tools of the lean operating system to deliver more value to customers with less resources every day. That is the essence of the CE Way, and this favorability and service restoration expense coupled with cost performance throughout the business provided $0.02 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2023. Rounding out the first nine months of the year, you'll note the $0.16 per share of positive variance highlighted in the catch all bucket in the middle of the chart; the primary sources of upside here were related to solid operational performance at Northstar and a tax related benefit, among other factors. Looking ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.14 per share of positive variance for the remaining three months of the year, given the mild temperatures experienced in the last three months of 2023. From a regulatory perspective, we'll realize $0.09 per share of positive variance, largely driven by the aforementioned electric rate order received from the commission earlier this year and the constructive outcome achieved in our recently approved gas rate case settlement, which went into effect on October 1, as Garrick noted. On the cost side, we anticipate $0.15 per share of negative variance for the remaining three months of 2024; in large part due to additional funding support for select cost categories that have trended above budgeted levels for the majority of the year, such as insurance premium and IT-related expenses. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance, which largely consists of the absence of select one-time countermeasures from last year and conservative assumptions around non-utility performance among other items. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.25 to $0.31 per share of negative variance. In summary, we remain well-positioned to deliver on our 2024 financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. As such, we are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $3.29 per share to $3.35 per share with a continued bias toward the high end. Moving on to the balance sheet. On Slide 10, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from S&P in August. We continue to target mid-teens FFO to debt on a consolidated basis over our planning period to preserve our solid investment-grade credit ratings as per long-standing guidance from the rating agencies. As always, we remain focused on maintaining a strong financial position, which coupled with a supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating cash flow generation supports our solid investment-grade ratings to the benefit of customers and investors. Moving on to our financing plan on Slide 11. I'm pleased to report that we've completed all of our planned financings for the year at levels favorable to plan and ahead of schedule, which leaves us with ample liquidity for the remainder of the year and beyond. I'll bring to your attention a relatively modest increase to our 2024 planned financings at the utility given the need to rebalance the rate-making capital structure in accordance with the recent regulatory outcomes and attractive pricing at issuance. It is also worth noting that we remain opportunistic should we see a cost-efficient opportunity to pull ahead some of our 2025 financing needs. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances to the benefit of our customers and investors, and this year is no different. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Rejji. CMS Energy over two decades of consistent industry-leading financial performance. We remain confident in our strong outlook this year and beyond as we continue to execute on our simple investment thesis and make the necessary and important investments in our system while maintaining customer affordability. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thanks very much, Garrick. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Shar Pourreza : Hey guys, good morning. A - Garrick Rochow Hey, good morning, Shar. I heard you didn\u2019t like our hold music. I heard that was a thing today. Shar Pourreza : Oh, God, it was on hold, no matter, but it's okay. Garrick Rochow : Hey, I like your choices. Yes, Metallica, but you don't have AC/DC. If you would have brought a little AC/DC, I'd have been there. What's your question today? There you go. There you go. Shar Pourreza : So just, Garrick, on the data center demand, obviously, everyone is mentioning it to kind of the degree, Michigan has obviously started to emerge as a favorable data center environment with some of the hyperscalers doing some land acquisitions there, Grand Rapids to be exact. Do you have sort of existing grid capacity to onboard kind of the new customers with that kind of an interconnection lag? What are you seeing on the ground? And do you need sort of a new tariff structure to move ahead? We've seen some interesting proposals coming out of Ohio, a lot of back and forth there. So a big question, but how do you think about those? Garrick Rochow : Michigan in our service territory, specifically you referenced Grand Rapids and that's been our service territory, is a great place for data centers and investment in Michigan. The temperate climate, the fiber infrastructure and to your point and really the point of your question here is we have the electric infrastructure to be able to serve. And so we work closely with data centers and other manufacturing customers to meet their timelines for the ramp-up and load. And so that makes us advantageous to locate a data center or as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, really manufacturing, there's been a lot of manufacturing growth that's shown up here. And so that's what's exciting about Michigan. I guess, the other thing is, too, when they look to our clean energy law, they can see a path to that growing clean energy, the renewables and then the clean energy standard by 2040, which is also attractive to the data center components. But I would highlight, too, just what I don't want to lose in this conversation is manufacturing growth. That's really where we've seen the true renaissance. We've seen a lot of opportunities show up there that will show up in our renewable energy plan as well, to serve our customers. And from my -- just going to the question on the tariff, you'll recall, we've already filed ex-parte type filing to move the data centers to what we call our GPD rate. That's a better reflection of the cost to serve, and we are working collaboratively with the commission to see if another rate structure is needed for data centers that would ensure our residential customers are not left subsidizing data centers. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Any timing on that, Garrick? Garrick Rochow : We would expect that we continue to make progress. I mean, like I said, the ex-parte filing has already been approved. And so we're in a good position there from a cost of service perspective. We'll continue to work with the commission. I would expect that to take place over the next six months to a year. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly, in terms of your takeaways from the storm and resiliency audits this year. Is your commitment to cutting outages supported by the current distribution plan? Or would you look to update the DSP to incorporate some recommendations from the audit? Or does it just inform you better to move the $1.5 billion incremental CapEx you're identified into base plan? Thanks. Garrick Rochow : This -- this audit that was completed -- we call it the Liberty audit because that was the company that was performing the work is really balanced and supportive. I mean, you could see that in the context of the support of the work that we need to do, the capital investments and free trimming to be able to continue to enhance reliability and provide better service and as in my prepared remarks, share, we can do that at a lower cost. So better service, lower cost when we do things proactively versus reactively, and so we have our five-year capital plan, that $7 billion plan that's comprehensive and very deliberate and focus. And we'll take the Liberty audit results, and we'll look to incorporate that in that plan. And I'll remind you, that's a $7 billion plan; $5.5 billion of it is incorporated into the capital plan. And so there's opportunity there to work more of that capital in, of course, with the support of the Public Service Commission staff and commission. Shar Pourreza : Fantastic. Thank you, guys so much. Remember, Garrick, Guns N' Roses next time. Thanks. Appreciate it. Garrick Rochow : AC/DC. AC/DC. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Jeremy Tonet : Thank for taking my questions here. Just wanted to start off, if you could walk us through a bit more, I guess, on DIG, given everything that we're seeing on the generation site needs their capacity needs. Just with contracts rolling off and how you think about, I guess, the trajectory there going forward? Garrick Rochow : NorthStar business, and I'll get to the big piece, continues to perform well. But frankly, I'd expect that. It's a small piece of the earnings mix. But they need to perform, and we expect them to perform, and that's exactly what they're doing, both from an operational and a financial perspective. And of course, DIG is an important part of that mix or Dearborn Industrial Generation. And we continue to see strength both in the capacity markets and the energy markets, and we are securing those bilateral contracts throughout time, and they continue to be above our plan and our expectations. And so it's a great story, and we continue to be a tailwind in our overall expectations around 6% to 8% EPS growth. Rejji Hayes : Jeremy, this is Rejji. All I would add is we've been -- Jeremy, just to provide a bit more of a financial lens to Garrick's good comments. As you know, we've had a good 25% to 30% open margin in the outer years of our plan. And so we'll provide an update on our Q4 call, as we always do around the levels at which we're pricing capacity contracts in that bilateral market. And as you know, we'll bring in a new year in our next five-year plan, and that will have even more open margin. And we continue to see reverse inquiry at levels well in excess of what we've historically realized from a capacity price perspective. And so we're usually around $3 to $3.50 per kilowatt month. We're now seeing 5 and 6 handles in reverse increase. So still a really robust opportunity. And unsurprisingly, it's just because of the real nice tactical we're seeing with just supply being reduced in Zone 7 through retirements and upward pressure on the demand curve. So we don't see any reason why that should abate anytime soon. Garrick Rochow : And one thing I'll remind you, Jeremy, too, it's not linear as well. We do have outages to maintain the system out there. So that's an important piece to remember, particularly as we go through the long-term plan. Jeremy Tonet : Right. That makes sense. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself there. But maybe just thinking about growth in general, we're seeing some of your peers talk about higher sales forecast and even some kind of lifting the expected long-term EPS CAGR expectation. And just wondering how you guys think about this given the incremental opportunities you see in front of you. I'm expecting strengthening and lengthening but just wanted to double check there. Garrick Rochow : Let me offer some comments, and I'm sure Rejji is going to want to jump into this as well. And we provided those differentiators, those tailwinds to give visibility and to instill confidence. And that's what we have. We have confidence about the ability to strengthen and lengthen that 6% to 8% EPS growth. But I want to be clear, what our investors expect is that we continue to deliver year after years. That's 21 years; we've now industry-leading or consistent industry-leading financial performance, time and time again. And then compounding off actuals, which gives you a better quality of earnings, that's what our investors inspect, that's what we expect and that's what we deliver. And so by providing some insights to those tailwinds, I just -- you get some idea of the momentum and how we can again strengthen our confidence in delivering this and just doing it year after year, exactly what our investors expect. But certainly, Rejji, I'm sure we want to walk in and offer some commentary on this as well. Rejji Hayes : Jeremy, all I would add to Garrick's comments is that when you think about the components of what will drive long-term growth, Garrick walked through in great detail in his prepared remarks, the opportunities on the capital side, whether it's through the capital investments and/or earning on PPAs in the context of new energy law, and that's going to be decades of financial opportunity, investment in PPAs again, the opportunities to improve the reliability and resiliency of our electric distribution, infrastructure that's decades of spend and investment opportunity to the benefit of customers and investors. And then in the gas business, which we didn't talk about as much on this call, but there's still a significant level of investment to be made to continue to harden that system, reduce future methane emissions and continue to keep it safe in the lab, particularly with pending regs coming out from FEMSA. And so a lot of investment opportunity and when the upward pressure that you alluded to on the demand side that will create the headroom among other benefits to facilitate and enable that investment to come to fruition. And so we see a really nice glide path to deliver on that differentiated 6% to 8% growth for many years, compounding off of actuals. And so we're not going to get ahead of our Q4 disclosure, and that's when we update our five-year plan, but we still feel very good about our ability to strengthen and lengthen that growth to Garrick's comments. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That makes sense. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today will be from the line of Ross Fowler with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Ross Fowler : Good morning, Garrick. Good morning, Rejji. How are you? Garrick Rochow : Good morning, Ross. Ross Fowler : Congratulations on the quarter, another solid one as we've all come to expect from CMS. So just a couple of questions. I think you've talked about the 2.5 gigawatts of storage target in the state. How do you think about -- could that change is sort of battery tax credit shift? Or does the cost of that change? Or is there just a lot of support for this at the state level versus what's going on at the federal level potentially after next week, how do you contextualize that's investment going forward? Garrick Rochow : Let me offer the two mechanisms that we have to consider what I'd call supply type assets. One is the renewable energy plan, which we'll file here November 15 in that range around that date. And that will lay out some of the renewable energy assets we need, both -- it will build off the foundation of our 2021 integrated resource plan, but then there's two tranches as I see it of additional renewable energy, that will show up in the terms of meeting the 50% standard of renewable assets for 2030 as well as 60% for 2035. That's really tranche one. And then there was additional renewable assets as a result of economic development and growth, the demand growth that we've seen. So that's a nice piece of work, a nice tailwind. There will be some reference to storage in there as part of that. But where more of the storage will play out is in our 2026 integrated resource plan. That's where we look at the capacity mix. That's where we look at the reliability of supply. That's where we'll look at those important components. In the degree, there's additional tax incentives or benefit that will play out in that process and that selection process. I do anticipate that there's going to need to be quite a bit of storage on the system, maybe even more than what is referenced in the law, but that's certainly a nice pathway to get things started with the certainty of the legislation. So hopefully, that's -- that's helpful. Rejji Hayes : Yes, Ross. Ross Fowler : Yes, Garrick, thank you. Sorry, Rejji. Go ahead. Rejji Hayes : Yes. Ross, sorry. I've been a little slower the drawn a couple of my comments. So pardon me. The only thing I would just add and it sounded like you're alluding to when you talked about next week, a potential repeal of the IRA and the implications of that on tax credits. Is that the thrust of the second part of your question? Or did I miss it? Ross Fowler : Yes. Yes. Just as that -- where can we contextualize that versus the state incentives that are kind of pushing this? Rejji Hayes : Yes. So I dare not wager or speculate as to the outcome on next week. I think that's a fool's errand and I think it's too difficult to call. But I do think it still remains a low probability that you see a repeal of the IRA. Because the reality is, one, you need a pretty sizable red way to just repeal the legislation. But even if you did want to hypothesize that that could take place, I think there's also a reality that the number of red states have benefited significantly from the legislation getting passed. I heard a stat the other day from one of the CEOs in our state who suggested about that 75% of the benefits of the IRA have accrued to red states. And so I think, again, even if you saw Red Wave significant enough, to, which I still think is a fairly remote probability to repeal the legislation. I still think there'll probably be a real significant discussion off-line about whether it would make sense from an economic perspective to go and undo all those benefits accruing really nationally, but again, more concentrated towards red states. So I still think it's a low probability event. And that said, and if it did happen, again, even if you wanted to take sort of that really remote probability come into fruition, we still have to comply with the law, to Garrick's comments, albeit it might be at a higher cost. But again, we still have to comply with the law in Michigan. Ross Fowler : Yes. Perfect. Makes sense. Rejji, you just seem more coffee this morning. So grab a cup of coffee. Garrick Rochow : Will do, yes. Ross Fowler : The next question I had, just kind of back to Jeremy's question a little bit on NorthStar and capacity auctions. I mean, MISO has sort of adopted a lot of the PJM changes around the VRR curve. So certainly, it seems like that will also go higher in next year's capacity auction at least that would mirror what happen at PJM. So do you sort of hold off on some closing down some of these open positions further out on capacity until you see what that auction clears out, so you have a better idea? Like I'm just trying to figure out the timing of how you work that through. Garrick Rochow : Our process has been with DIG to just layer these in over time. That's really a de-risking mechanism for us. And certainly, the sometimes where we might strike at a price point that's a little lower than the future, but there are times where it's going to strike at a price point that's a little higher than the future. And so we've had that approach. It really de-risks and becomes a predictable source of earnings by taking that -- these bilateral contracts or just kind of layer in minimum over time. Ross Fowler : Basically sense ties into this [indiscernible]. Thanks, guys, another solid quarter. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : The next question today is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Guys, thank you so very much for the time. Appreciate it. Good to see you all guys. Get that coffee going. Garrick Rochow : Keep it going. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So to the extent -- thinking of which -- you guys had this pretty big swing in the cost number in that waterfall slide, you talked about that minus $0.15 last quarter, that was a plus 9. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, insurance and IT. Can you speak a little bit on exactly what's going on? Is there a pull forward going in there as well that's timing intra year. I mean is there a wildfire impact that's impacting insurance? I'm just trying to understand what are the big pieces? Rejji Hayes : Yes, Julien, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question, and let me provide a little bit more color on that. And so we have a number of cost-related line items that we track throughout the year. We obviously have expectations going into the year and budgeted levels for across every cost category. And through the course of the year, some of those line items track ahead of budget and not in a good way, so higher than budget. And so we countermeasure that largely through the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives. And in some cases, as we get to Q4, and we don't think we'll have sufficient countermeasures to offset that. There are times will just sort of fund those cost categories at levels that we anticipate at the end of the year. And so sorry, I said differently, we have a level of countermeasures as well as Q3 weather help that have given us enough contingency to fund those cost categories to levels that we anticipate than being at the end of the year. And so we're just funding those costs. Insurance was one example. We had IT-related costs that were trending a little ahead of budget. Another one is we also have some regulatory assets that are or liabilities that are amortizing that are at higher levels in the prior year associated with our EV programs and others. And so it's a hodgepodge of cats and dogs that were just trending ahead of budgeted levels. And so that's really what we're funding there. And that's why you see that big increase in the Q4 year-to-go expectations versus where we were in our Q2 call. Is that helpful? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. So basically said differently, you would have been holding off on funding some of it into 2025, you realize that you have the ability to do so, so you pull them back forward. Rejji Hayes : Yes, I wouldn't call them a pull ahead. To be clear, these are not expectations of costs that we'll have in 2025 that we're trying to de-risk. These are costs that we are incurring right now and the actuals we have seen in the first nine months of the year in excess of what we've budgeted. And so we're applying some of the contingency that we've accumulated through countermeasures, NorthStar outperformance and just point old-fashioned, good weather in September and applying that contingency to just fund those cost estimates for the end of the year. So these are just 2024 funding and just basically updating our forecast to reflect the economic reality we're seeing across those cost categories. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Wonderful. Thank you guys very much. Good job there. Garrick Rochow : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Travis Miller : Hi. So on the REP, you've touched on this a couple of times, but the -- anticipating that sales growth number going up. As you were going through that process, not to front run this too much for the next couple of weeks. But as you're going through the process, did you have enough visibility in terms of sales growth from data centers and what you mentioned on manufacturing some of those kind of 24/7 type loads to be able to incorporate, again, some of the stuff you touched on in terms of storage and perhaps other renewable technologies. Can we -- will we see that in this REP or is that something to look more for in the IRP? Garrick Rochow : The short answer is yes, but let me explain more. In the renewable energy plan, we'll start out with the base or the foundation is really the 2021 integrated resource plan, which you'll remember calls for 8 gigawatts of solar and we've built some renewables as part of that as well. So that's the foundation. The first piece will -- the 2021 IRP did not get us to 50% renewables by 2030 or the 60% number by 2035. So there's some renewables that will have to be constructed or through a PPA with an FCM, that will have to happen. That's tranche one. The second tranche is specifically because there's additional sales expected as a result of economic development. And so we forecast that out over 20 years, and so we do have visibility to it. But we have to have certainty around it as well. So these are items that we are -- have high confidence around, and we have signed contracts around. This is not the pipeline or some hypothetical numbers. It's -- again, a reflection of what's coming to the state in terms of -- so we have to answer question directly, yes, visibility of that. That will also drive additional renewable assets or purchase power agreements to meet that need as well. So if you continue to follow that down, I expect it to be a mix of solar and wind that will make that up. And then, of course, we'll talk about more details of that at EEI as we file that. So that's part one. The second part that I would also is the IRP. And remember, renewable energy plan just deals with energy. You have to deal with the capacity; you have to do with the reliability of supply. You also have the opportunity to accommodate additional sales growth. That will show up in the integrated resource plan as well. So I assume it's two mechanisms -- two opportunities where we'll see those tailwinds of again, ownership of assets, investments to deliver clean energy on behalf of our customers or through a PPA with the financial compensation mechanism. Rejji Hayes : Hey Travis, this is Rejji. All I would add is that if you look at Slide 6 in our presentation today, you can see on the left-hand side of the page, and Garrick spoke to some of this in his prepared remarks, there's a raft of opportunities we've seen from an economic development perspective. And I think we've got eight or so listed on the page. Only two of those are in our current five-year plan, Goshen and Ford. The rest of these are additive to our plant. So that offers some breadcrumbs as to the additional opportunities we're seeing. And I will tell you that some of the opportunities that are pretty high in probability that we're still not quite in the plan yet are likely going to be coming to fruition in the coming months. And so there's a lot of opportunity that we've already seen since we rolled out last year's five-year plan. And so at this point, that's well stale. And so again, you'll see that update in our REP. You also see it in the five-year plan that we roll out in Q4 next year in addition to the IRP, as Garrick noted. So you get some visibility on Slide 6 today. And again, we're looking forward to talking about more opportunities in the coming months. Travis Miller : Okay. That's great. I appreciate all that detail. And then one more for me on different subject. The Liberty audit, would you anticipate on the regulatory side, the potential for putting in regulators to put in some kind of performance mechanism or some kind of metrics to meet before you get approval for the additional CapEx or operating costs? Garrick Rochow : I anticipate that we'll take the Liberty audit findings and weave them into our five-year reliability plan, which will, of course, enhance that plan, provide opportunities for additional capital investments to again address reliability for our customers proactively offering better service and lower cost. So that will be part of it. I anticipate there will be additional tree trimming or operation and maintenance expect that we've woven into the plan as well as part of this Liberty audit. And as the commission -- one of the actions that the commission has already taken is a performance-based ratemaking that's focused on reliability work. And so I anticipate that's woven into this work as well. I don't think it holds us up from making these important investments. And we're making them now and seeing good performance improvement in terms of reliability and we just need to continue to do that important work. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Sullivan : Hey everyone, good morning. I think it's been asked a couple of times now, but just to level set us for load growth and what's coming in the REP. My recollection is you have historically talked about 2% -- less 2% energy efficiency and you're kind of flat is kind of your base case today? And then, it sounds like you're excited about all this kind of new load growth, but what's actually going to be reflected in the REP is going to be pretty conservative and not some big shift change? Is that a fair characterization? Rejji Hayes : Michael, good morning. It's Rejji. Thanks for the question. So just to level set, our current five-year plan that we rolled out in the fourth quarter this year, had about 0.5% of electric load growth on a five-year compound annual growth rate basis. And you're right, that number is always inclusive of energy waste reduction. And so if you wanted to gross that up, you could think about that as about 2.5% growth. And again, net of energy efficiency, 0.5%. We expect pretty significant upward pressure on that growth rate in the IRP -- sorry, from the REP, renewable energy plan, filing that we'll publicize in the coming weeks. And then we'll get another kick at the can, obviously, in the IRP filing about a year later. And again, between that, you'll get more color on the loan growth assumptions embedded in the five-year plan that we rolled out in the fourth quarter of next year. And so again, you should see pretty material upward pressure. We do plan conservatively, guilty as charged. But we do also want to reflect the reality of what we're seeing because remember, this is a component in our rate proceedings. And so you will see, again, upward pressure on that -- those load growth assumptions. And to Garrick\u2019s comments, we do really try to incorporate whether it's data centers, industrial companies; we try to incorporate those in the plan when they're close to being signed or effectively signed and moving forward. We really try not to speculate if we've seen some momentum across the state, but it's not coming to fruition. That's not something we'll put in our plan. So we're conservative from that perspective. But again, the takeaway here is that you'll see upward pressure on our historical growth estimates in this next cut. Michael Sullivan : Okay. So significant upward pressure, but conservative. I got it. And then just shifting over to the electric case, I also just kind of wanted to level set there. So it sounds like you are going to probably adjudicate this mainly because of the storm mechanism because this is kind of a first go around for that? And what specifically are you asking for? And where is staff on that with respect to the storm specifically? Garrick Rochow : Rejji will walk through the numbers in a moment. Let me just start out by saying staff's position as a constructive starting point. And as I shared in my prepared remarks, there's a number of things that have been supported in SaaS position. But there are some distribution investments for our customers that have, I would say, been left on the table. And we're focused on improving reliability. We know we can do that, offer better service. We're proving that out by our five-year plan, and we can do that at a lower cost, doing it proactively versus reactively. And so in addition to the storm recovery mechanism, which you referenced, which is also referenced in the Liberty audit as well. But we're also focused on those distribution investments to offer better service for our customers. And so there's a bit of advocacy we are doing on behalf of our customers. So we can make those investments to improve service. That is also a component which may push us into an adjudicated order. But I'll remind everybody, I'm open to settlement. It's just going to have to have -- it's going to have to continue to be more than where the staff is currently at. But Rejji, just share with Mike where things are at from a cost perspective. Rejji Hayes : Yes, so, Michael, the mechanics of the storm restoration tracker that we're proposing in our pending rate case. And if memory serves me, DTA is proposing a similar structure. We're essentially trying to take the five-year average of service restoration expense and put in the equivalent of a true-up mechanism where there's a 50% share for investors with customers. In the event our level of service restoration expense is above or below what's embedded in our rate case. So to give you a specific numerical example, if we had $130 million of service restoration expense in rates and a year in which we incurred $150 million of actuals, $10 million of that would be absorbed by shareholders. So we'd have $10 million of hurt flowing through our P&L and $10 million would be established in a regulatory asset that we would recover at a later date. And so customers would fund that portion of it. And if we saw the numbers go the other way, you would assume a commensurate level of regulatory liability and so on. And so it's -- as we see it, that provides good alignment of incentives between investors and customers with a mechanism like that, and we will limit a lot of the volatility we've seen in our P&L over the last several years because the levels of service restoration expense embedded in rates have been well below actuals now for the last several years and counting. And so that's the spirit of it and have to spend more time offline on that if need be. Garrick Rochow : And just to offer some numbers, our staff is at $170 million at a 9.5% ROE, 49.9% equity ratio. And our rebuttal position, we're at $277 million at 10.25% ROE, 50.75% equity ratio. So a little bit of cost of capital difference there as well. But I wanted to just make sure, Michael, you had the revised position of the company. Michael Sullivan : Okay. That's great color. Just real quick, staff on the storm specifically though, are they outright against it or they're just looking for a different structure than what you just\u2026 Garrick Rochow : They're not supportive of it, but again, not supportive, but we expected that. Just like the investment recovery mechanism, it had to go to the commission. And we anticipate some mechanism like this will require the commission to weigh in on. And so it's not a surprise we're to ask that. And again, if we're going to go after that, it's going to go likely to a full order. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Thanks for helping [ph] me through all that. I appreciate it. Garrick Rochow : You\u2019re welcome. Have a great day, Mike. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Weisel : I was also going about -- hi, I was also going to ask about settlement. I guess I appreciate the detail there. I guess if there were to be a deal to be made, what would be the window for that? Or is it a relevant to where that happens? Garrick Rochow : Yes. We're in that window now. And so -- and really up to a final order as the window of opportunity for us. And so -- and we'll look -- again, we'll look, I'm always open to settlement. I've said that in calls before. If we can make things work for our customers and for all stakeholders, I mean that's a good place to be. There's just a couple of things in this case that may force us into a full order, and we just want to make sure everyone on the call is aware of that. Andrew Weisel : Yes. Understood. New tools are often a policy question. So I understand that completely. The other question I wanted to ask about the CapEx update. I understand we'll have to be patient on the numbers. But the two things I wanted to ask about. Number one, just qualitatively, it sounds like there's going to be a lot of things going into that. There's always a business as usual update, but you've got spending around the REP. You got spending around the Liberty reliability audit, you've got the electric reliability roadmap with stuff going in there, plus you've got sort of a step change in demand growth from data centers and manufacturing, what I'm getting at is, should this be a meaningfully bigger increase than what we've seen in recent years? And if so, how should we think about financing that? You previously talked about up to a $350 million per year of equity in 2025 and beyond. I'm guessing there might be an upside bias to that given all the pieces that I just mentioned. How should we think about a rule of thumb about incremental equity needs per incremental dollar of CapEx? Thank you. Garrick Rochow : Rejji and I'll tag team this one, but I want to remind you that many of the tailwinds that we described in this call come as a result of approval of the renewable energy plan or approval of the IRP. And so although we'll file it in November of this year, fast-forward 10 months. So it's going to be in late Q3 of 2025 before we see where the commission is at with that. And so I wouldn't expect some of that good work to show up until our Q4 call at the end of 2025, early part of 2026. And then you'd have the same cycle for the IRP, which would start in 2026 and then play out in 2027. So I see these as tranches that go over time over the five years. Clearly, there's some tailwinds here, but they show up at different points in time. But I'll turn it over to Rejji to offer some additional color. Rejji Hayes : Yes, I think that's exactly right, Andrew. I mean the governors we've talked about and when we prepare our capital plan, our affordability balance sheet and an operational feasibility. Can we get the work done and those remain governors. But the fourth governor at this point is the pacing to Garrick's comment. And so just the time for the commission to review the REP, the time for the load opportunities to materialize. Yes, we signed contracts, we interconnect these opportunities, but it takes a while for build-out of a manufacturing facility or data center. So the pacing is going to certainly dictate when we'll be able to bring in all of this additional capital opportunity and see the load materialize, which effectively will fund those capital investment opportunities. So that's really the fourth governor at this point. But you will see upward pressure for sure in the $17 billion five-year CapEx number we've provided at this point. So without a doubt, but it will be pacing before you see the material bump, but I feel very good about the underlying earnings growth and rate base growth that will come from the next vintage. With respect to equity, as you know, and as you stated, we have said no equity obviously in 2024. And then up to $350 million starting next year and we've said that's a pretty good run rate for the current $17 billion capital plan and the sensitivity I'll share with you as you think about incremental capital going into the plan and what that might drive in terms of incremental equity needs. As a general rule of thumb is for every dollar of CapEx we invest at the utility, we usually fund it with around $0.35 to $0.40 of common equity, and that has been tried and true for some time. Now what's interesting over the last, I'll say, two years to three years is that we've seen downward pressure that sensitivity in terms of the equity needs, and it's really been driven by a few things. One, obviously, we just continue to generate substantial cash flow in the business, because of the forward-looking test year and the rate construct of Michigan. So I'll give an example, our prior five-year plan of $15.5 billion of capital generated about $12.5 billion of operating cash flow over a five-year period in aggregate. This current vintage is $17 billion. We expect $13.2 billion of cumulative operating cash flow generation, vintage over vintage. So almost $1 billion of increased vintage over vintage. And so just good cash flow generation. That's one. Number two, the ability to monetize tax credits afforded to us through the IRA, that's another big driver of liquidity and effectively a new source of equity that's helping our metrics and then just offering another layer of liquidity to fund our capital plan. So that's also helpful and we did our first tranche this year, about $90 million of dispositions, and we did that at levels better than planned, meaning the discount to par was better than we thought it would be. And so I anticipate us doing more of that over time. And then the last one is just -- I feel like a broken record when I say this is, we do plan conservatively. And so for the debt we're going to issue at the holding company, we're assuming it's straight debt with no equity credit, but we've been known to issue subordinated notes or hybrids in the past. Those get now a greater level of equity credit from Moody's, as you know, and so we're at 50% now. And so if we start to see pricing for those types of securities improve over time, that creates an opportunity also to put downward pressure on that sensitivity because obviously, if we see pricing comparable to what our debt assumptions are in our plan, then we can do hybrids at a level that's credit accretive and EPS accretive to plan. And so those all create opportunities for us to really minimize the equity needs as we increase the capital in our five-year plan. Andrew Weisel : Okay. That's extremely helpful details there. Thank you very much. So just to be clear on the CapEx numbers, though, so we should not expect numbers related to the REP or IRP but we should expect upside to CapEx related to reliability and the demand and economic development. Is that maybe a fair way to put it? Rejji Hayes : Yes. You certainly won't see the full magnitude of opportunities associated with the REP. And the other reason I'm qualifying the comment a little bit, Andrew, is that you start to earn on PPAs effective mid-this year, and so we'll assume additional PPAs going forward. And so we'll start to see that opportunity associated with the renewable energy plan scale every year because we're doing PPAs for renewables every year. We'll probably start to layer in some of the capital investment opportunities in outer years of the plan. And so you'll see some of that weaved in and you'll definitely see your comment reliability and resiliency. But again, the lumpier opportunities associated with the energy law, you won't see until really starting in the 2026 vintage of our five-year plan. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Appreciate you are clarifying. I guess, maybe I needed some coffee this morning as well or some early Halloween candy perhaps. Thank you guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And for our next question, we'll move to the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I just have one question. So when I look at your current supply stack on the system, I mean, how much of it is imports from like self-generation versus the imports from the grid. And I understand that the MISO dispatches assets, et cetera. But I'm just debating how much of spare capacity that you have of your own right now? I mean, if I were to be an industrial customer or hyperscaler, how much could you offer me in megawatts right now? Garrick Rochow : Well, let me offer you this and then we'll talk a little bit about the mix from MISO and the like. After our 2021 integrated resource plan, we were along from a capacity perspective. And there was a couple of things. One, we kept additional assets available to us as part of the settlement. We acquired the Covert Generating facility was 1.2 gigawatts. In the meantime, since 2022, when that was approved, we've also built out renewable assets, both wind and solar, and both here some PPAs as well as some owned assets. And so that's actually put in a position where we've been long and we've been able to accommodate a lot of sales growth. And then, as a reminder, we have the mechanisms, both the renewable energy plan and the integrated resource plan with some flexibility in those because we look at them -- two years on a renewable energy plan basis every three to five on an integrated resource plan, but we can pull it up and adjust those as needed to be able to accommodate the additional growth. The third piece with these hyperscalers is working with them because they're not going to all come on immediately. And they have plans and when they want to ramp up. That's also true with manufacturing. And so they may need a starting load in 2026, but their full ramp-up doesn't get out to 2028, 2029, 2030. And so there's a lot of work that we do with the customers to make sure we get that right. And so there's a lot of flexibility we have to make sure the supply and demand stack match up nicely and we can grow Michigan in the state. Now, we do leverage MISO to be able to do that. And if you look at our total mix, it's about 46%, 40-ish, 5% that we either have through PPAs or through purchase off market. Remember those PPAs act as both capacity and energy as well in that mix. And then the rest is self-generated. Angie Storozynski : But again, I'm just -- again, I'm debating it myself, if I were to cite like a big industrial facility or a data center, I would probably care about the speed to power, right? So this initial availability of megawatts would probably matter to me. So you're saying you are long tower even right now. So even, say, the next, say, 24 months, there is spare capacity that you could allocate to such a user? Garrick Rochow : The short answer is yes. And we work closely with customers to be able to do that. I'll give you a real example. And it just hit the press today, we talked about in Q1, but we couldn't name the company. Switch, which is an existing data center in Michigan, is expanding by 230 megawatts. They want to be up by full load in 2026. We're able to do that. We're able to deliver that, as the electric infrastructure, both with our transmission partner and the distribution infrastructure as well as ensuring we have the supply. And so that gives you a little nature of our ability to deliver on that. And as we other -- entertain other hyperscalers or other manufacturing, again, we work with them closely to match up the ramp-up schedule. I gave the example of Corning as well in my prepared remarks. Corning wants to out low down by the first quarter of 2025. We're constructing the substation right now. We will deliver that. But again they want to ramp up. They go from a small amount of megawatts up to 90, 95 megawatts. That quarter is over a year. And so we pace that along with that company. So those are two real examples, real work going on in the state and just gives you an idea of how we work with customers to grow Michigan and grow in our service territory. Angie Storozynski : And what if there is like a very big site, let's say, a gig of eventual capacity? I mean, is this something that you feel comfortable accommodating. I mean, it is obviously, that would probably require a large -- well, two large combined cycle gas bonds to be built. How do you think about those sort of very big projects? Would you prefer to have smaller sites? Or is there, from like a risk perspective, do you think comfortable accommodating the big loads like that? Garrick Rochow : We welcome growth in Michigan. I mean there's nothing better than create jobs. And we've got a constructive -- I mean, we're doing a lot of onshoring. It is truly a manufacturing renaissance. We're certainly open for data centers as well. And we work with those customers, large sites, small sites, to create opportunity for all stakeholders in the state. And so it doesn't -- we don't back away from a gigawatt load. Some of those are on one site; some of those are across multiple sites. And it's really, again, working with that company on their ramp-up schedule and when do we need to provide that and match that supply/demand mix. We've been doing this for 135 years. I used to be -- I started out my business -- in the business, I should say, on the supply side. So I get this. And that's what we do as a load serving entity; we have the mechanisms within the construct to be able to do that with success. Angie Storozynski : And just to make sure. And how do you, for example, ensure that this load actually materializes like when we look at power companies, like they have those take-or-pay contracts. How do you ensure that if you make the investments, actually the load will happen? Garrick Rochow : One of it is contractually, but it's also, as I shared in my earlier remarks, making sure we've got a good -- from a rate design perspective, a cost of service model. That's how we operate in the State of Michigan. And so that makes sure that the other customers aren't subsidizing that work. And as I shared, we're working closely with commission and commission staff with data centers to see if there's additional rate compact or construct to be able to further ensure that residential customers aren't subsidizing or putting the bill for the data centers. Operator : Our next question will be from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for squeezing me in. And I know it's a tough morning with Shar telling you what music to listen to and Ross telling you what to drink. So I'll keep it quick. Just I apologize. I think it's up to Mike Sullivan's question, the low drills update. Will we get that on the fourth quarter call on when you file the IRP, just when is the most up-to-date of the load growth. Rejji Hayes : Anthony, this is Rejji. Yes. So you will get a load forecast update and the renewable energy plan that we'll file in the coming weeks, and you will also -- we will also have a load growth update a few months later, that's supporting the five-year plan that we'll roll out on our fourth quarter call in the first quarter of 2025 as we always do. So you'll get a couple of bites of the cherry from a load growth perspective. And as Garrick noted in his earlier comments, you'll also see a load growth update about a year from then, maybe 1.5 years in the context of our IRP filing. So we'll have an iterative process for load disclosure. And again, as I said earlier, I expect upward pressure certainly on current estimate of 0.5%. That would certainly go up and it will likely accrete beyond that. So looking forward to sharing those with you in the coming weeks and months. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then just lastly, one of the earlier questions, you talked about how the financing needs of the company. Also, I think the amount of equity now maybe 30% to 40% for every dollar spent. You also mentioned tax credits were going to be instrumental. Has the company quantified what we could assume for transferability over the next five years? Rejji Hayes : So the latest number I'll guide you to is what we have embedded in our five-year plan, Anthony, and that's a little over $0.5 billion. But again, I expect that number to increase over time just based on the quality of the execution and also the anticipation of more renewable ownership should allow that number to accrete. And so this current plan has $0.5 billion in aggregate over five years. And again, as we provide an update on our five-year plan on our fourth quarter call and Q1 of next year, I'll provide a revised number, and I'd be surprised if that number doesn't continue to increase. Is that helpful? Anthony Crowdell : Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions and see you in Hollywood. Garrick Rochow : Yes, see you in Hollywood Operator : We have no further questions in the queue at this time. So I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Harry. And I'd like to thank you for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you at EEI, take care and stay safe. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. And now, I'll turn the call over to Garrick. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Jason, and thank you everyone for joining us today. In the words of James Brown, I feel good. CMS Energy. Twenty-two years of consistent industry-leading financial performance. Every year for over two decades. You can count on us to deliver. We do that through our simple but powerful investment thesis, coupled with disciplined execution across our electric and gas businesses. We take our legacy of service and excellence seriously at CMS Energy. We play to win every day. We have a lot to celebrate about 2024, and today, I will highlight a few key successes, among many, to demonstrate how we deliver for all of our stakeholders year in and year out. First, our work to improve customer reliability. Our five-year reliability roadmap, which we filed in 2023, set bold commitments to improve service to our customers. To never have more than 100,000 customers disrupted per event and have service restored within 24 hours. And we are making progress. In 2024, we restored power to over 93% of customers within 24 hours, compared with 87% in 2023. And the average customer experienced 21 fewer power outage minutes. And although there is still more work to do, it is clear the investments are making a meaningful difference. I'm also pleased with the work on the electric supply side. In November, we filed our 20-year renewable energy plan. This critical long-term filing highlights the thoughtful changes we will make to our generation portfolio as we transform our system for more renewables and a diversified mix that includes nine gigawatts of solar and four gigawatts of wind over the next two decades. This filing details to the commission our commitment to leading the clean energy transformation and achieving the target established in Michigan's 2023 energy law. Most importantly, it demonstrates our commitment to diversify the energy portfolio and invest in supply infrastructure to serve our customers with reliable and clean energy in the most affordable manner. And, of course, our gas business continues to grow. I'm extremely proud of our coworkers' efforts to build and replace infrastructure that ensures a safe, reliable, and clean natural gas system. The system has proven invaluable to customers throughout the year and even more recently in the extreme cold experienced in January. I could give many more examples, and some are listed on this slide, which speak to the winning program at CMS Energy and are further proof points of our investment thesis in action, ensuring you can count on us to deliver value for all stakeholders every year. On slide five, we've highlighted our five-year $20 billion utility customer investment plan, up $3 billion from our prior plan. A significant and needed increase designed to deliver better customer service through improved reliability both in distribution and supply, driven largely by our reliability roadmap. As we bolster our electric distribution system and by investments in our supply portfolio as we expand our renewable pipeline to meet the energy law. This plan supports 8.5% rate-based growth through 2029. In addition to the robust customer investment plan, we have growth drivers outside traditional rate base. These are important and sometimes overlooked, so let me spend a moment here. The financial compensation mechanism, which allows us to earn on PPAs, grows during the five-year period, offering approximately $20 million of incentives by the end of the decade and continues to grow thereafter as we secure additional PPAs. There's more than $60 million per year of incentives through our energy efficiency programs, enhanced by the energy law. We also expect incremental earnings from our non-utility business NorthStar Clean Energy, as we continue to see attractive pricing from capacity and energy sold at Dearborn Industrial Generation, or DIG. I want to take a moment to highlight the long runway of customer investments, which are incremental to our five-year plan, giving us confidence in our financial performance and continued growth of our company. Slide six shows the detailed filings we expect over the next ten years and beyond, which will be incorporated into future five-year updates. On the slide, you can see key investments in the electric distribution system to improve reliability for our customers through rebuilds, undergrounding, hardening, and technology. $10 billion of opportunity not in the five-year plan. In the middle of the slide, renewable energy plan. An ambitious and thoughtful plan to achieve 60% renewables by 2035, as required by the energy law, and in response to significant load growth in our service area, providing for additional wind and solar resources. $10 billion of opportunity not in the five-year plan. And finally, the 2026 integrated resource plan filing, which will shore up the intermittency of renewables, build out battery storage, and deploy clean energy required under the energy law. The modeling for this filing is underway and will provide additional customer investment opportunities. So altogether, well over $20 billion that is not in the five-year plan. Now let's talk about our formula to keep rates affordable for our customers to accommodate these needed investments. You know our track record. You've heard me share in the past about our deliberate and sharp focus on taking cost out. Whether it is episodic cost savings through plant closures, renegotiating PPAs, operating our plants better than the markets, leveraging the CE Way for process improvement, the use of digital technologies to improve efficiency, or strong economic development. I'm confident in our ability to keep bills affordable while delivering on the needed customer investments, ensuring every dollar is maximized and adds value. Speaking of economic development, I've said it before. Michigan is in a renaissance. Growth. Our five-year plan now incorporates the significant economic development we are seeing with upwards of 2% to 3% annual load growth. We feel really good about the quality of growth we see materializing across our service area in the state. Data centers and manufacturing load. Well, we see a nice mix coming to the state. The manufacturing growth brings with it jobs, supply chains, commercial activity, housing starts, and residential growth, which allows us to couple customer investments with affordability as we spread fixed costs over a larger customer base. We're committed to growing Michigan, and we are pleased with what we've contracted and the now nine gigawatt pipeline of opportunities not yet in the plan. We work hard every day to win our customer's business, and we are honored when businesses see the value in investing in our state and our service area. Jumping to Michigan's regulatory environment, we continue to see a strong and supportive energy policy to ensure timely recovery of investments and incentives above and beyond stated ROEs, as well as constructive regulatory planning mechanisms like renewable energy plans, integrated resource plans, and investment recovery mechanisms that streamline the rate case process. In 2024, we delivered successful outcomes in our electric rate case, settled our fourth consecutive gas rate case, and saw support for our distribution investments through the Liberty audit. For 2025, we expect a constructive outcome in our electric rate case with an order by the end of March. Our gas rate case is in the early innings, but we expect good support for the needed investments to keep our system safe. Rejji Hayes : And as I shared earlier, the renewable energy plan with an expected outcome in late Q3 of 2025 is something to look forward to given the large amount of renewables needed to meet the energy law and the growing demand we're seeing across our service area. Now onto the financials. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.34 for the high end of our guidance range. For 2025, as you might expect, we are raising our 2025 guidance off 2024 actuals from $3.52 to $3.58 to $3.54 to $3.60, which represents 6% to 8% growth, and we continue to guide toward the high end. We also continue our long-standing tradition of compounding off actuals, providing our investors with a higher quality of earnings. Longer term, we continue to guide toward the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which implies and includes 7% up to 8%. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. We continue to target a dividend payout ratio of about 60% over time. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji. Rejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick. And good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2024, with adjusted net income of $998 million, which translates to $3.34 per share and towards the high end of our guidance range. The key drivers of our 2024 financial performance included constructive regulatory outcomes, a solid beat at NorthStar, cost performance fueled by the CE Way, a variety of non-operational countermeasures which more than offset the many challenges we saw throughout the year. For the second year in a row, we experienced significant weather-related financial headwinds, primarily in the form of mild winter temperatures in the first and fourth quarters. In fact, for our records in 2024, we had the warmest winter in the last 25 years, based on heating degree days. Yet despite these challenges, we managed to offset the weather-driven headwinds without compromising our commitments to our customers, communities, or coworkers. To elaborate on the strength of our financial performance in 2024, on slide eleven, you'll note that we met or exceeded all of our key financial objectives for the year. To avoid being repetitive, I'll just note that we successfully invested $3.3 billion as per original guidance to make our electric and gas system safer, more reliable, and cleaner on behalf of our three million customers at the utility. We managed to do this while funding the business in a cost-efficient manner largely through operating cash flow, well-priced bonds at the utility, and tax credit transfers in the inaugural year of this new financing vehicle. This funding strategy enabled us to maintain our solid investment-grade credit metrics and associated ratings as affirmed by each of the rating agencies over the course of the year, most recently by S&P in December. Moving to our 2025 EPS guidance, on slide twelve, you'll note the rebasing of our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance off of actuals. For additional clarity, our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance increased by $0.02 per share on the low and high ends of the range commensurate with the amount by which our 2024 adjusted EPS of $3.34 exceeded the midpoint of last year's EPS guidance. Our increased 2025 EPS guidance implies 6% to 8% growth with continued confidence toward the high end of the range as Garrick noted. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility providing $4.01 to $4.05 of adjusted earnings as we plan for normal weather, constructive rate case outcomes, and earned returns at or near authorized levels. At NorthStar, we're assuming an EPS contribution of $0.18 to $0.22, which incorporates a planned maintenance outage at DIG, offset by ongoing contributions from NorthStar's clean energy business. Lastly, our financing assumptions remain conservative at the parent segment with the expectation of approximately $1.3 billion of new holdco long-term debt and up to $500 million of equity to support the increased capital plan at the utility. Our 2025 guidance also assumes the absence of liability management transactions. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range, you'll see the usual waterfall chart on slide thirteen. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analysis herein are measured on a full-year basis relative to 2024. From left to right, we'll plan for normal weather in this case amounts to $0.39 per share of positive variance given the expected absence of the atypically mild winter temperatures experienced in 2024. Additionally, we anticipate $0.21 of EPS payout attributable to rate relief by the residual benefits of last year's successful gas rate case settlement and the expectation of constructive outcomes in our pending electric and gas rate cases. Outside of the general rate cases, we also expect to see earnings contributions from our renewable investments as construction of these projects progress. As always, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation, property taxes, and utility interest expense. As we turn to the cost structure in 2025, you'll note three cents per share of positive variance due to the anticipation of continued productivity driven by the CE Way. We also expect a healthy reduction in operating expenses attributable to the closure of our remaining coal units midyear, which will be largely offset by increases to vegetation management and other electric reliability-related cost categories, all of which align with our pending electric rate case. Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance which largely consists of the reversal of select countermeasures in 2024 and expected capital cost associated with the aforementioned parent financings. We're also including the usual conservative assumptions around weather-normalized sales and taxes among other items. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.37 to $0.43 per share of negative variance. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions throughout the year to mitigate risks and deliver our operational and financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. On slide fourteen, we have a summary of our near and long-term financial objectives. As Garrick noted, from a dividend policy perspective, we're targeting a payout ratio of about 60% and anticipate remaining in that area over the course of our five-year plan. Given the elevated cost of capital environment and the breadth and depth of customer investment opportunities before us, we continue to believe that it is prudent to retain more earnings to fund growth. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings and will continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly as we balance the needs of the business. As such, we intend to resume our at-the-money, at-the-market, or ATM acquisitions program in the amount of up to $500 million in 2025 as mentioned earlier. We expect this level of equity issuance to trend down in the outer years of our plan as we increase the size of our tax credit transfer program, given the substantial renewable build-out underway in accordance with Michigan's energy law. Lastly, we also expect select large multiyear economic development projects to begin coming online in 2025, yielding approximately 1% weather-normalized load growth for the year with run-rate assumptions of 2% to 3% in the outer years of our plan as other large projects come online. Slide fifteen provides a look into the historical performance and estimated growth of NorthStar's DIG facility with upside potential beyond 2026 as capacity prices in zone seven continue to increase. Given the rising cost of new entry, we have updated potential range of outcomes accordingly. As you can see in the bars on the far right-hand side of the chart, we remain bullish on the opportunities in the bilateral market for DIG and will continue our strategy of layering in contracts over time. Slide sixteen offers more specificity on the funding needs in 2025 at the utility and the parent. The only additional financings I've mentioned for the year are the planned debt issuances at the utility, which we anticipate being a little over $1.1 billion. It is also worth noting that we have not assumed the issuance of any junior subordinated notes, also known as hybrids, in our 2025 financing plan or in our five-year plan, which offers a potential opportunity if we see attractive price points in the market. Needless to say, we'll remain opportunistic throughout the year. On slide seventeen, we have refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan is minimized. Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable, and clean energy at affordable prices. Our diverse and battle-tested workforce remains committed to our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. Garrick Rochow : Thank you, Rejji. Finish where I started. And with James Brown. I feel good. But I can't hold a tune. So instead, I'll fix like this. Twenty-two years. Twenty-two proof points of consistent industry-leading financial performance. Providing you with predictability and strong growth compounding off actuals, which very few do in our sector. Providing you with a higher quality of earnings. We had a great 2024, remain confident in our strong outlook for 2025 and beyond. As we continue to execute on our simple investment thesis and make the necessary and important investments in our system, we will maintain customer affordability. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you very much, Garrick. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone. If you're using a speaker function, please make sure you pick up your headset. We'll proceed in the order you signal us, and we'll take as many questions as time permits. If you do find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing the star key followed by the digit two on your touch-tone telephone. And we'll now pause for just a second. Our first question today will be from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning, team. Nicely done. Thanks again for the time. Appreciate it. Garrick Rochow : Hey. Morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Let me kick it off here. Hey. Good morning. Thank you. Look. Let me just kick it off on something a little bit more timely here. Just with respect to the permitting, you guys have a lot going on the renewable front. I'd love to hear your thoughts about the ability to execute in this environment. You guys specifically have wind in your outlook. I'm just curious to get your thoughts here given some of the backdrop here on the ability to execute, and especially given the permitting regime has been something of a conversation in recent times in your geography. Then I'll pivot back to some of the financials. Garrick Rochow : Well, the team is doing some amazing work, and from a pipeline perspective, both on wind and solar. And I'll just give you some context of that before I jump into kind of the administration kind of federal administration piece. We just finished up a wind project in late last year which was very successful. We got two large solar projects underway. A Muskegon solar project's 250 megawatts. Just announced this last week, another 360 megawatts we're building in Southwest Michigan. And so and this team's got along the pipeline. So this whole permitting thing, here's a secret to it, and it's not much of a secret. It's being on the ground. Right? It's with the locals and the local townships, local communities to get accepted for the projects and the tax dollars that come with those projects. It's working with landowners. That's been our success. And so when it comes to specifically wind in this administration, that's particularly aimed at federal lands. We're not doing anything offshore, and we're not doing anything on federal lands. It's all private. And that's where our point of success is. And so we do see we do see an opportunity for future wind projects. In many cases, it's been repowering. It's expansion within existing parks. And there's a couple new projects that are underway and under consideration. But I feel good about our ability to build out these renewables. And then remember always that this renewable energy plan is an iteration. So if I gotta make an adjustment in a year, we'll do that. And that's what gives me a lot of confidence about our future and ability to continue to deliver on this important customer investment agenda. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. Excellent. Thank you for that. I know that other folks are kinda curious to understand exactly how that gets implemented, if you will. But pivoting back to the business, I mean, obviously, very nicely done here. Thank you for the updates on the low growth front. I mean, can you speak a little bit to what the legislation you know, does and especially could do prospectively? You kind of alluded it in broader terms. Can you speak a little bit more specifically in terms of what the contribution is in the 2% to 3% and what the big moving factors could be, especially subsequent legislation, which is fairly recent, right, in terms of what's reflected in that 2% to 3%? Garrick Rochow : You're assuming are you talking about state legislation? Just to clarify your question, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Apologies. Yeah. I'm thinking about the sort of the data center avenue. And to what extent is that reflected in that 2% to 3%? And, again, is it just a little bit too nascent given recently some of the stuff materialized? Garrick Rochow : So I wanna be really clear about our sales growth, and this is exciting piece because it's evident in our renewable energy plan that we filed in November. It's part of our five-year plan that we're talking about today. This 2% to 3% load growth is not a pipeline. It's not hypotheticals. This is stuff that contracted. We have a high confidence that we're building substations to support. Some of this load starts to come on in 2025 and then continues out throughout 2029 in this five-year plan. So there's a lot of there's a high degree of confidence about this 2% to 3%. That's the important piece. And then if you look forward, there's a nine gigawatt pipeline. And there were several quarters ago, I talked about that pipeline. It was smaller, so grown, and it shifted a little bit to more data centers. It's about 65% data centers now. The rest is manufacturing. And that's in part due to this legislation passing, the sales and use tax. So that passed in end of the year. The governor just signed it mid-January, and so we're starting to see a nice uplift there. And you hear, like, you've heard Microsoft acquiring land. We're working with other hyperscalers as well. And so and you've also heard about a semiconductor project in Genesee County. There's a lot of energy here. No pun intended. A lot of excitement about the sales growth here. Both what we've secured in that pipeline. And so I'm excited about Michigan. Rejji Hayes : Yeah. Julien, all I would add to Garrick's comments is you think about the 2% to 3%, just to give you additional specificity, we've got multiple projects embedded in that. I'd say six or seven larger ones, and it's well diversified. So data centers are represented in that mix. But, again, there's a lot of non-data center activities we've talked about for some time, just given the attractiveness of Michigan. Remember, it's not just competitive rates. We've also got, obviously, good fiber network. We've got really good access to fresh water, which is attractive for a lot of these manufacturing businesses because they do include water in their processes. And we've got a lot of energy-ready sites because we've been doing the hard work for many years now, not just over the past couple of years. So we are well prepared to welcome these opportunities into Michigan, and the opportunities embedded in that 2% to 3% in our five-year plan, those are either signed or imminently signed. So again, there's not a whole lot of beta around those opportunities. The one thing I would circle back to on your question about the permitting is that as Garrick noted, all of the projects we're executing on are on private lands, and as I understand it, you know, the private lands are also to some extent in the crosshairs a bit. But I think that that's also centered on wetlands associated with private property. Again, none of our projects are situated in wetlands that could be subject to federal regulations. So, again, to Garrick's comments, we feel very good about our fact panel, respect to permitting and the associated build-out of renewables over time. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Alright. Excellent, guys. I'll leave it there. See you guys soon. Alright? All the best. Rejji Hayes : Take care, Julien. Operator : The next question will be from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeremy Tonet : Morning, Jeremy. Rejji Hayes : Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to dive in a little bit if I could with regards to, I guess, how you feel about the regulatory environment in Michigan. There's been, you know, some concern in the marketplace with recent orders and figured that it would be good just to hear from you guys how you think about things these days. Garrick Rochow : Jeremy, you like sausage? I mean, I love breakfast, so I gotta tell you this. I gotta tell you this. Like, a breakfast burrito, an egg scramble, I love seasoned sausage. The reality is, like, I don't like how sausage is made. No one wants to see how sausage is made. Right? And I think that's the that's the challenge. Everybody's getting wrapped around the axle about the Michigan regulatory environment, and that's just the nuances of the mark of the environment. You got the pluses and deltas. Everybody's paying attention to it, but the bottom line is the bottom line is we get constructive outcomes. 2022, 2023, remind you of 2024. Like, successful electric outcome. It consist you know, fourth consecutive gas settlement. We'll get a constructive outcome in this electric rate case. And so like, yeah, there's this push and pull that goes on within the regulatory environment, I'm not here ringing my hands. Like, I'm we like, our job is to sweat the sweat the small stuff. That's what we do. We sweat the small stuff. We work to we work the commission process. And we get constructive outcomes. And so when we're out there talking about 6% to 8%, toward the high end, this consistency and predictability that our investors can count on is because we sweat it. Day in and day out. So bottom line, we work through all that at the commission. And we get to good outcomes. And I think that's the bottom line, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Sausage. Understood. Just wanted to go if I could pivot to DIG for a second here. It seems like I think you mentioned outage. I'm just wondering, how much of a headwind that is for per EPS this year. If you could quantify that. Garrick Rochow : Well, first of all, I'll let Rejji walk through the numbers on that, but the teams did this were just like any major outage, we do these every seven, eight years. Teams prepared, ready to execute, materials are all there. And so we've talked about this last year, and this is part of the plan this year, and it's there's some renewables that are part of the mix that help with the EPS numbers and contribution from NorthStar. Rejji Hayes : Yeah. I think Garrick summarized it well, Jeremy. So, yeah, we'll probably lose about a little less or rather a little more than 50% of DIG's contribution in prior years, but that will be offset by contributions from existing operating assets. Remember, we do have a thermal generation fleet beyond DIG. We also have existing renewable projects such as the Aviator Project and others. And then we also do have some multiyear projects that are underway that we expect to achieve commercial operation data COD in the second half of this year. And so it's a combination of additional contributions from new and existing operating assets, and so that should offset DIG's contribution this year. Jeremy Tonet : Right. I guess I was just thinking. I mean, guidance might have been even higher if not for this turnaround. But understood your points there. That's what we thank you. Rejji Hayes : Yeah. I mean, outages are reality of the business. So, unfortunately, this year, we'll have a modest DIG, David. But in the subsequent years, we expect to see additional growth, which we highlighted on slide fifteen in the materials. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thanks. Operator : The next question today will be from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Sullivan : Morning, Mike. Garrick Rochow : Hey. Good morning. Michael Sullivan : Hey, Garrick. I didn't eat breakfast, so you're making me making me a little hungry. I have sausage. Garrick Rochow : I usually eat before the weekend. Like, I can't treat myself. All the time. I gotta wait for the weekend. Operator : There you go. Michael Sullivan : Actually, I wanted to start with Rejji just on the financing side. So do you mind just maybe bridging us a little bit from the $3 billion CapEx increase to will you increase on the equity side? Because it seems like maybe a little bit less than what we would have otherwise expected in terms of equity need. How much is maybe tied to tax credit transferability? Any additional color there would be helpful. Rejji Hayes : Yeah. Happy to provide some information on that, Michael, and appreciate the question as always. So as you may recall, in the past, we've talked about this sensitivity between every dollar of capital investment funded by about thirty-five to forty cents of common equity at the holdco. And that's about where we are if you just think about the glide path from this vintage we've just rolled out today of a five-year plan versus a prior. And so to give you specific numbers, we're up $3 billion vintage over vintage of aggregate CapEx. And so that implies about another $120 million or so of equity. The prior plan had up to $350 million of equity starting this year, and so you add $120 on top of that. You start to get that $500 million range. And that's what we expect from an equity issuance perspective over the next two to three years. And then as we get to the outer years of this plan, it does step down, and that's why I said on a long-term basis, the average will be about $450. And what you see is we do have we're expecting about $85 million or so roughly of tax credit monetizations this year, but that will step up over the course of this five-year plan as we execute on more renewable projects to comply with the energy law. And so we expect over $700 million of tax credit transfers in aggregate over the course of this five-year plan, and that compares favorably versus the expectations in the prior five-year plan, which was closer to over a little over half a billion. So that tax credit ramp-up or that tax credit transfer ramp-up is really what's driving down the equity needs in the outer years of the plan. And I would say in the front of the plan, pretty directly consistent with our historical sensitivity between CapEx and equity needs. Michael Sullivan : Okay. That's really helpful. And second question, I'm gonna stick with you here, Rejji. In terms of the liability management side. How do you think about if there's more to potentially do if necessary? I know you didn't bake it into the plan, but if weather is mild again for the second or third year in a row, are there more levers to pull on that front? And then maybe if I could also tie in, like, again, where you're conservative without baking in any hybrid issuances. Like, is that available to you currently, you think? And just wanted to be really conservative? Yeah. Just trying to think about where you have some of the flex. Rejji Hayes : Absolutely. And so I would say with respect to liability management, certainly, that was a very helpful tool in the toolkit over the course of 2024 and 2023, I'd remind you. And so we did lean into those. I think the benefits are several fold. I mean, obviously, we wanna peg them to weather. And so we'd have to see what weather does over the course of the year if we were gonna go down that path because we view opportunities like that as transitory like weather. So we would wanna peg it peg them to weather. But I'd say given our utilization of those over the past couple years, I'd say there's certainly more opportunities there, but we'd have to see where interest rates go. I mean, right now, it certainly makes the environment hospitable because rates have remained range-bound and fairly high, which creates the discounts on extinguishments that drive the gains. But, again, we have to see where weather trends and needless to say, going on year eight here at CMS. And as we've said before, you know, we don't discriminate when it comes to the cost structure, and so we look broadly, whether that's tax planning, whether that's operational O&M related flags, whether that's a CE Way. We will continue to look throughout the cost structure and execute on levers wherever we find them. And that's why we've been successful for so many years now. It's just staying paranoid identifying risk, quantifying risk, and making sure we have opportunities that exceed the risk. And so that's what we'll do going forward. That's the playbook, and I don't see us deviating from that. Transitioning to the question around hybrid, certainly, that's an opportunity as I think we may have talked about in the past. The real limitations there is, obviously, we'll see where market conditions are, but it seems like there's pretty good depth and appetite for junior subordinated note paper in the market. We saw some issuances recently and at pretty interesting levels. And there was quite a bit of activity last year, I think, catalyzed by Moody's increasing the equity credit they ascribed to hybrids in Q1 of last year. So certainly an opportunity. And we were doing those long before that was that became a thing. And so I'd say it represents less than 10% of our book capitalization. There's a threshold by S&P at 15%, and so that gives us about $3 billion of additional capacity to do hybrids. And so, again, it's a tool in the toolkit. We'll be opportunistic. We see the right pricing, and that can allow us to do both credit and EPS accretive deals from a financing perspective versus plan, we'll certainly look to do that. Michael Sullivan : Really appreciate it. Very helpful. Thank you. Rejji Hayes : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Weisel : Morning, Andrew. Rejji Hayes : Good morning, everyone. You covered a lot of areas. Just one quick I wanted to clarify on the dividend. The pace of the increase has decelerated, past couple of years. Wanted to just understand the payout ratio for 2025 should be right around your target at 61% based on the midpoint of guidance. You obviously tend to beat the guidance midpoint as we all know. So my question is looking to 2026 and beyond, how should we think about the dividend growth? I understand it's a board decision. Rejji, I think you made a comment about wanting to retain more earnings to finance growth. How should we think about the pace of dividend growth relative to earnings going forward starting in next year? Rejji Hayes : Yeah. I appreciate the question, Andrew. And I'll take a walk down memory lane, because as you may recall, when we sold EnerBank, in 2021 in at the risk of sounding self-serving, boy, is that transaction aged well. We increased the growth rate at that time, and that's when we started going toward the high end to 7%, 8%. We just thought it was prudent to decouple the dividend per share growth at that time from the EPS growth. Also, we did have to rightsize it because we went up to, like, 65% payout, which we thought was not comparable versus our growth year peers. And so at that point, we've been on this sort of glide path of DPS growth. It was initially sort of low 6%. It's now sort of 5% to 7% toward the low end. And that has made a lot of sense as we glide path down to a 60% payout ratio. And just frankly, again, to your comment and my comment in my prepared remarks, retain more earnings so that we can redeploy those earnings into the utility growth and rate-based growth. And so that will be our MO. As I look in the outer years, again, we'll probably have pretty consistent dividend per share increases. And so you'll see that growth kinda being the low 5% year over year. And I still think we'll be no. I think I anticipate us being sort of in that sort of low sixties, high fifties range for some time. And to your comment, we'll obviously have to confirm that our board is supportive of that year in and year out as we always do. But it should be, you know, around 60%. Again, it may be sort of high fifties or thereabouts, but I think that, again, is the most prudent use of capital in the current environment because we've got a breadth and depth of CapEx backlog that really warrants significant. So support from a funding perspective, and we just don't think it makes sense to sort of recycle the capital through the external markets. Why not just retain more and redeploy it into the business? So that's gonna be our MO for some time. That helpful, Andrew? Andrew Weisel : It is. I certainly don't disagree. I just wanted to make sure you're comfortable going into the fifties, and it sounds like you are. Thank you very much. Rejji Hayes : Yep. Operator : The next question will be from the line of Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nicholas Campanella : Morning. Morning. Rejji Hayes : Hey. I just wanted to ask just a follow-up to Jeremy's question a little bit further on, like, NorthStar and the big opportunities. Just you've outlined some of the potential upside there, but to the extent that you have, just better bilateral opportunities that come down to pipeline that are incremental to that. Is that still just a further extension of the 6% to 8%, or would you kind of reevaluate, you know, at that time? Thanks. Rejji Hayes : Yeah. I'm gonna use three words, Nick, with which I think you're well familiar and you know, our bias is always to strengthen the length in the plan. And so while there certainly may be additional opportunity with the roughly 25% open margin that we highlighted in the outer years of the plan, which could be we've contracted at really attractive rates. Just given the tightening we continue to see in zone seven. You know, it just gives us additional opportunity to strengthen the length of the plan. And I think it's worth reminding folks, and Garrick highlighted this in his prepared remarks. I mean, remember, we compound off of actuals year in and year out. So you really wanna make sure that you've got enough support to do that because it gets harder every year by definition. And so, again, that's been our bias for some time, and that would be the intent. As you can see on slide fifteen too, yes, there's open margin, there's a tightening market, and there's additional opportunity, but it's also important to know we did realize a good portion of that in this plan. And so you can see in that bar that says 2026 through 2029, we've stepped up the earnings power of DIG pretty handsomely by, again, contracting at really attractive rates. So there's still additional opportunity on the outside looking in, but we didn't realize a good portion of that this plan. Let me stop there and see if there's any further questions beyond that. Nicholas Campanella : No. Hey. That's helpful. And then I just my only follow-up on the REP, like, I know it's early, but just is this something that you expect to take a full distance, or is there a settlement potential opportunity in there too? Garrick Rochow : We'll always look for settlement opportunities. This renewable energy plan would be more similar to the integrated resource plan. We've had success in settling integrated resource plans. And so, again, I would look for settlement opportunities in that renewable energy plan. But at the latest, it'll go into the Q3 of the year. And, again, it's a good plan. Got confidence in taking the whole way if need be. Nicholas Campanella : Alright. Thanks a lot. See you soon. Garrick Rochow : Thanks. Operator : Our next question will be from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, team. Good morning. Thanks for the discussion today. Garrick Rochow : Hey. Good morning, Garrick. All my other questions have been answered. Just one big picture question on tariffs. You know, they if, you know, China tariffs and in fact, now as you know, when they stay on for a prolonged period of time, just thinking about how it impacts you, especially given you have a considerable amount of renewable investment in the plan. So when we talk to your supply chain, how you're dealing with that, just, you know, any color you could share, that would be great. Thank you. Garrick Rochow : Really, the team's done great work. We've really done our homework here. So just let me talk through some numbers. So when we look at direct spend across our supply chain, and we looked at it both Canada, Mexico, and China. It's a little over 5% direct that it's coming from one of those three locations in the world. When we look at indirect spend, so indirect, you're going with a company that might be US-based, but they have a spend in either, again, Mexico, Canada, or China. It's a well, again, a little over 5%. So we're talking about 10% to 12% of the overall supply chain mix. And so it's small in the context, so that but to your point, we're actively working to mitigate that. And that's one, we've bumped up our supply stock a bit. Two, we've looked at how to migrate to other vendors that are US-based that's a way to deal with it as well. So that's the supply chain. So I got great confidence in our ability to execute the capital plan and keep bills affordable for our customers. Now the other piece is in electric and natural gas, so let me talk about that. Homework we've done as well. Because there as part of MISO, there are you know, Canada is part of the MISO mix. But remember this, given our natural gas plants. We're typically putting energy into the market. Great heat rates. Got low cost of incoming natural gas, and that's a nice hedge. Save our customers over a couple hundred million dollars this year. And we'll continue to set a hedge from what if there is if there's any volatility or an increase in electric prices in the market. So really positioned well there. And then gas. We bought last year, and this was a high for us, we bought about 6% of our gas from Canada. Again, and that was at a high. And so remember, we have seven interconnects. And so I've got six other interconnects that I can leverage for US gas, be able to mitigate that. So, again, I feel like I'm in a really good spot there or the company's in a really good spot from a tariff perspective for natural gas. And then finally, and I imagine we'll get this question over time, when we look at it in some detail, is that often you start to think about other industries. And so often with Michigan, with our rich heritage on automotive, the question comes up, well, tariffs, how do they impact the automotive industry? And I'll remind all our investors that a little over 2% of our gross margin is in the automotive space. In tier one and tier two. So we've got a very diversified service territory. Which helps mitigate some of that risk that might show up for the automotive industry. And so a lot of detail there, a lot of data. You can tell we've done our homework. But till like, we can we can really manage and mitigate the impact to our customers. I know Rejji wants to get on into this too. Rejji Hayes : Yeah. Durgesh, all I would add to Garrick's dissertation is that for the avoidance of doubt, we actually do not directly source any material from China. So as Garrick noted, we may have second or third derivative exposure, like I think most global and diversified businesses on the planet do, but again, we do not directly source any material from China. And the only other thing I mentioned is that we are obviously using the place in the CE Way when we work with our vendors. And we do have operating reviews with our vendors, and we are working very actively with them to ask them the same questions you're asking us. What are they doing to mitigate the risk of tariffs? We're making sure that our contracts with our vendors, particularly those who do have second or third derivative exposure to some of these locations that are in the crosshairs, that there's the appropriate level of risk transfer or risk sharing in our contracts. So we are doing work with our vendors just to make sure we've got the right level of visibility on the manufacturing footprint and what and make sure we have clarity on what they're doing to mitigate these risks. Durgesh Chopra : Wow, guys. That's really comprehensive. Appreciate all the detail. And actually just prompted a follow-up question that I was just curious about. Is there a way to think about your equipment and your supply chain, how much of that is domestic versus international because my top process is this is just not China, Canada, right? This is this might be the, you know, the European Union might be next year. You know, you know. So just I would think about domestically versus internationally, sourcing equipment and other things. Garrick Rochow : Well, Durgesh, hopefully, what you heard from our early responses, again, we sweat the details. Right? So our investors don't have to worry. I mean, that's the big message here. But just going back to those numbers, like, from a again, Canada, Mexico, China, and certainly, Rejji clarified that the China piece you know, we're talking about and indirectly, about 10% to 12% where there might be materials that are coming from those three countries. And so, again, most of it's US-based, which gives us a great deal of confidence in our ability to execute the plan. Rejji Hayes : Yeah. Durgesh, all I would add is that we do not principally source most of our materials domestically. You know, some of them are internationally sourced, but most of them are domestic. And, again, I think the key, really, operationally, is, you know, it's really important to have a diversified vendor base, and we've done that quite a bit on the solar side. We're sourcing domestically a lot of solar to derisk. We've been doing that for many years now, not over the past couple months, last several years. We've also broadened our footprint to sourcing from Southeast Asia with respect to solar modules, and that's been really helpful as well. So, again, we've really taken an all-the-above approach to make sure we're well diversified and not subject to over-indexing or over-concentration in any particular area. Durgesh Chopra : Perfect. Thank you, guys, and congrats on the update here. Rejji Hayes : Thanks. Durgesh Chopra : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Arcaro : Hey. Thanks so much, Clint. Garrick Rochow : Hey, David. David Arcaro : Was curious on maybe the broader kinda Michigan backdrop for supporting data centers. And I was curious, is there excess capacity as you see it in Michigan or in your own fleet of on the generation side, you have extra, like, buffer to absorb data center projects and some of this load that you're seeing? Garrick Rochow : Well, first, first start with Michigan. Michigan's been very supportive. Both in the sales and use tax. And as Rejji mentioned in his earlier comments, we've worked closely with regional and state economic development organizations to help locate data centers as well as manufacturing facilities in Michigan. The biggest piece that we do in our economic development team does is help in the placement. And so there's not tons of excess transmission capacity out there, but there is there is advantages to where you're located in the state, and we help along with the transmission provider, locate and try to position those across the state. And in some cases, it does require transmission build-out. Requires distribution build-out. We try to make that small, that we're able to keep the cost down, but also so we can do it in the time frames that are expected. From a supply perspective, we feel good about our supply mix. We're continuing that renewable energy plan incorporates that 2% to 3% growth. We're building up those additional renewables to meet the energy law, but also for that sales growth. We do our integrated resource plan, we're gonna again, look at the needs there. So we have these filings to be able to build that out. But remember, out of the last IRP, integrated resource plan, we're at a surplus. And so we've been able to leverage that as well to be able to attract these businesses in Michigan. And so, again, I feel good about our ability to place them here. And have the supplier resources to meet that. And the final thing I'll add to it as well is remember, these loads don't come out all at once. And so there's timing piece and we work with those companies. We know those timing pieces. And so, for example, we've talked about this. We know that switch, the data center, wants to be full load by 2026. Well, we're building that. We're constructing that now. They've they bring a little load on the 2025. And we'll have it on by 2026. And so we know all those, whether it's manufacturing, or whether it's data centers, and so we can stage those and make sure we have the what's the physical distribution and transmission, but also the supply resources to be able to meet their needs. David Arcaro : Gotcha. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe a quick question just going back to the rate case. I know it's late in the process, but are there opportunities here to still settle broadly or individual pieces before the finish line? Garrick Rochow : I'm always open to settlement. You know that. But, again, times the clock is ticking on this one, and we've had the PFD, and I would just offer this. Staff is staff is a really constructive starting position on this. And I just as a reminder, like, these are staff professionals. They do their homework. They done a lot of due diligence in this case. They put it in testimony. It's a, you know, a nice constructive starting spot, which I have a lot of confidence in that. And then you also add our experts. Who bring best practices and bring benchmarking to that. And so there's a nice blend that should occur between staff's position and the company's position. But bottom line, I have a lot of confidence we're gonna get to constructive outcome. Whether it be settlement, or probably more likely, through a final order in March. We'll get to a constructive outcome. It'll be good for all stakeholders. David Arcaro : Okay. Great. For all the updates. Garrick Rochow : Yeah. You bet, David. Operator : As a reminder, if you would like to ask any further questions, please dial all one now? Please go ahead. Your line is open. Garrick Rochow : Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Durgesh Chopra : Good morning. Rejji Hayes : The hey. Quick clarification on the long-term opportunities. When you put the numbers $10 billion on the reliability roadmap, $10 billion on the electric the REP rather. Are those opportunities that are simply outside the plan, I. E. Year six through ten or those opportunities that might come into the five-year plans. Garrick Rochow : Right now that $20 billion plus of opportunities is outside or incremental to the five-year plan. As those filings progress, it's an opportunity to bring them into the five-year plan. Or, to your point, add them in years six through ten. But it as you can see, it's a rich a rich opportunity. From an investor standpoint, but they're really needed customer investments, needed from a reliability and resiliency system as we see higher wind speeds, as we see more frequent storms, and higher customer expectations. We need to make those investments in the electric distribution system for our customers. And then the other one is in just in terms of the energy law, we have to have renewables in place 60% by 2035. Those are needed investments for cleaner air in compliance with this with the law as well as supply growth that we are seeing across the state or supply demand, I should say, that we've seen across the state that we referenced. And then finally, important investments in our gas system. To ensure the safety of natural gas gas system. Now that's not on the slide, but that's another important piece of the of the five-year and then the tenure. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Great. And then the 2% to 3% electric growth, if you end up realizing that type of growth, is there a chance that you could get off of that kinda one-year rate case cadence, maybe extend it to two years. Is that a possibility as you've run them numbers, if you get that electric demand growth up. Garrick Rochow : We're confident that we're gonna see that. So again, I go back. So you used the word if, and I just wanna make sure I'm we're really clear about this. These are contracts. These are things where we're like, if I take, like, Corning, you know, $900 million investment, 1,100 jobs, know, we're bringing on the elect we're building the substation now, bringing electric to serve them, and like, these are being realized. I just wanna give that level of confidence. Again, our approach there's occasion where we stayed out for a year on a rate case. Our strategy is really to be in there annually to do smaller type increases, to have an active dialogue with the commission, that's where we see the best outcomes and successful outcomes for our customers. And so I would anticipate that annual rate case cadence continues going forward. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Great. No. That's all very helpful. You answered most of my other questions. Appreciate it. Garrick Rochow : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : With no further questions queued, I will now turn the call back to Mr. Garrick Rochow for some closing remarks. Garrick Rochow : Thanks, Harry. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you on the road this year. Take care. And stay safe. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",
