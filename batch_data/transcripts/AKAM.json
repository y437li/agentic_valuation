Inc., Research Division Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter Akamai Technologies, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Philip, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. Tom Barth : Well, thank you, and good afternoon and thank you for joining Akamai's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 1, 2014. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations website at akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. F. Thomson Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Q1 was another excellent quarter and a great start to the year for Akamai, with revenues and earnings both exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Q1 revenue was $454 million. That's up 23% over Q1 of 2013. Our excellent performance was driven by continued strong traction across all of our major product lines and geographies, with especially strong growth for our security products. The overachievement compared to guidance was driven by greater-than-expected traffic for our media delivery solutions. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $105 million or $0.58 per diluted share, which is up 14% over Q1 of 2013. Our overachievement on the bottom line was primarily driven by the better-than-expected revenue. As most of you know, we completed 2 major transactions during the first quarter. First, we closed the Prolexic acquisition on February 18. And then 2 days later, we raised $690 million through our convertible debt offering, further strengthening our balance sheet for additional strategic flexibility. I'll be back in a few minutes to talk more about our security products and some of the other achievements from the first quarter. But first, let me turn the call over to Jim to review our financial results in detail and to provide the outlook for Q2. Jim? James Benson : Thank you, Tom. As Tom just highlighted, Q1 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both top and bottom lines. As I walk through the details of our Q1 financial results, I'll provide you with the consolidated numbers that include roughly 6 weeks of the Prolexic acquisition, and where appropriate, I'll also provided you with Akamai's results for Q1 excluding Prolexic. As Tom outlined, Q1 revenue came in above our guidance range at $454 million, up 23% year-over-year with strong growth across the business. Prolexic accounted for approximately $7 million in revenue for the quarter. Excluding the impact of Prolexic and also adjusting for the ADS divestment and foreign exchange headwinds, revenue was still up 23% year-over-year. Revenue growth was strong across every solution category, but the overachievement was primarily driven by better-than-expected traffic growth in our media business. Turning specifically to our media delivery solutions. Revenue was $215 million in the quarter, up 19% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. We are very pleased with the growth in media coming off a very strong fourth quarter and absorbing the impact of new pricing terms for our largest media customer that became effective on January 1. Traffic and revenue growth accelerated across most of the customer base, with particularly strong growth within our software download and gaming customers, driven by unplanned patches and gaming releases. Additionally, there were several large live events in the quarter that also had some modest contributions to the revenue overachievement. And while events like the Winter Games in Sochi and the NCAA Basketball Championships do not materially move the needle on revenue within the quarter, they do highlight our unique ability to deliver high-quality video over the Internet at scale. Turning now to our performance in Security Solutions. Revenue was $198 million in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Excluding the impact of Prolexic, revenue was up 22% year-over-year and roughly flat sequentially. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth in our Web Experience Solutions, and as Tom mentioned, we saw a nice uptick in growth rates in our Web security solutions. Net signings were particularly strong for both our Kona and Prolexic security offerings, an important proof point of early traction with our Prolexic integration. Finally, revenue from our services and support solutions was $41 million in the quarter, up 48% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially. We continued to see solid traction in service attachment rates across all of our solutions, and we saw an uptick in event-driven revenues as customers relied on Akamai service professionals to help them execute the notable live media events I mentioned earlier. Turning now to a review by geography. Effective this quarter, we revised our method for splitting out U.S. and international revenues. Previously, revenues were split based on the invoicing location. Starting in Q1, revenues are split based on the location in which the sale originates. Prior period amounts have been recast under this new method, and the historic growth rate trends are very similar under both methods and a reconciliation of the 2 methods for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 can be found under the Quarterly Earnings Release section of our Akamai website. Sales in our international markets represented 28% of total revenue in Q1, flat from the prior year and up 1 point from the prior quarter. International revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, with currency fluctuations having a negative impact on revenue of approximately $2 million on a year-over-year basis and negligible impact on a sequential basis. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, international revenue grew 26% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. We continued to see strong growth in our Asia Pacific geography, and we were very pleased with the improved performance in our EMEA markets. Revenue from our U.S. market grew 23% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Our U.S. market continued to perform very well for us and have particularly strong growth in our large strategic accounts. And finally, revenue through resellers represented 24% of total revenue in Q1, up 4 points from the prior year and up 3 points from the prior quarter. This improvement was primarily due to traction with our carrier partners, as well as contributions from Prolexic's strong channel relationships. Moving on to costs. As expected, our cash gross margin was 78%, flat with the prior quarter and up 2 points from the same period last year. As we've demonstrated over the past couple of years, we continued to execute well on our management of cost of goods sold. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 69%, flat with the prior quarter and up 2 points from the same period last year. GAAP operating expenses were $193 million in the quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $152 million, up slightly from Q4 2013 levels and at the low end of our expectations due to some planned hiring that shifted into the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $204 million. That's up 6% from Q4 levels and up 23% from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 45%, up 1 point from Q4 levels and consistent with Q1 of last year. This result exceeded our expectations coming into the quarter, primarily due to our revenue overachievement and also from lower OpEx related to hiring that shifted into Q2. For the first quarter, total depreciation and amortization was $54 million, which included $38 million of network-related depreciation, $8 million of G&A depreciation and $7 million of amortization of intangible assets. Interest income for the first quarter was roughly $2 million, consistent with the prior quarter. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was $2 million. This noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the quarter was $73 million or $0.40 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $105 million for the quarter or $0.58 of earnings per diluted share and coming in $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range due to the revenue overachievement and hiring shifts I highlighted earlier. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $47 million, based on a tax rate of 39%. This rate is up roughly 9 points year-over-year, reflecting the expiration of the R&D tax credit and a nonrecurring deferred income tax charge related to our foreign operations. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $55 million, based on a tax rate of 34% and in line with our guidance. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 182 million shares. Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 58 days, up 3 days from the last quarter and up 1 day from Q1 of 2013. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation, were $84 million, roughly in line with our expectations if you include Prolexic's CapEx. As a reminder, our CapEx number includes network investments as well as capitalized software development, global facility build-outs and IT-related expenditures. Cash generation continue to be solid, with cash from operations in the first quarter of $89 million. During the quarter, we spent approximately $116 million on share repurchases, buying back about 2 million shares at an average price of just under $59. As of Q1 end, we had $586 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. We had roughly $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This includes approximately $655 million from the net proceeds of our convertible debt offering in February. As we've discussed in the past, we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide financial flexibility necessary to make the best investments at the most opportune times. As always, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our shareholders in a manner we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. Our Prolexic acquisition is a great example of how we've used the strength of our balance sheet to invest for future growth. In summary, we are very pleased with how the business performed in Q1. We continue to execute well, deliver strong revenue growth, manage network cost effectively and make the necessary investments that we believe will build a foundation for sustained, long-term growth. As I have shared previously, we expect the Prolexic acquisition to be slightly dilutive to our earnings over the next 4 quarters, as expenses will exceed revenues until we absorb and scale the business within Akamai. Operationally, we will be integrating Prolexic into our core security business, and going forward, we will not be reporting on them separately. Looking ahead to Q2, we are expecting another strong quarter, with revenue in the range of $464 million to $478 million. This guidance includes a full quarter of Prolexic revenue. As a reminder, Prolexic revenue run rate exiting Q1 was approximately $5 million per month. At current spot rates, foreign exchange is expected to have a positive impact of roughly $2 million compared to Q1 and $3 million compared to Q2 of last year. We expect cash gross margins of 77% to 78% and GAAP gross margins of 68% to 69%, which is flat to down about 1 point from Q1 levels as we absorb the Prolexic acquisition and increase network investments to support expected traffic growth. Q2 non-GAAP cash operating expenses are projected to be $166 million to $170 million, up from Q1 levels as the business absorbs a full quarter of Prolexic spend as we continue to further ramp investments in go-to-market and R&D resources and as we add facilities and infrastructure costs to support headcount growth globally. Factoring in the above, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of 42% to 43%, down 2 to 3 points from Q1 levels. As I've been messaging in prior calls, we are planning to operate the company in the low 40s EBITDA range in the near term. To be more specific, we expect EBITDA margins between 40% and 42% in the back half of the year, as we fully integrate Prolexic and as we continue to ramp up the necessary investments that we expect will help drive Akamai's growth and scale beyond 2014. Whether we land at the high end or low end of this range will be heavily dependent on revenue volumes. I would also add, and as I shared at the March Investor Summit, the long-term EBITDA model for the company remains at 40% to 45%. With this revenue and spending configuration, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.57. This EPS guidance assume taxes of $50 million to $55 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 34%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of roughly 182 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $90 million to $95 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. This is an uptick in spending due to the addition of several large facility and IT investments focused on scaling our infrastructure, as well as costs associated with expanding the Prolexic network footprint. Taking into account these important investment areas, which will continue throughout 2014, we expect full year CapEx as a percent of revenue to be slightly above our long-term model for the year. In closing, we accomplished a great deal in Q1 and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. Now let me turn the call back over to Tom. Tom? F. Thomson Leighton : Thanks, Jim. It's great to see Akamai get off to such a strong start for the year, and I'm very optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. I would like to thank all of you who joined us for our Investor Summit last month, whether you were here with us in person or you tuned in for the webcast, you heard me talk about the 4 grand challenges that we're focused on solving for our customers : delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality and scale and at affordable price points; making websites and apps have near-instant performance even on congested cellular networks; protecting websites and enterprises from the many attackers that are trying to take them offline, corrupt their content or steal their confidential information; and making branch office connectivity for major enterprises be much faster and more affordable. I want to focus my remarks today on the challenges relating to video and security, both of which contributed to our success in Q1. As many of you know, the amount of video being consumed online has been rapidly increasing. For example, on February 2, we delivered the Super Bowl to 5.5 million online viewers, making it one of the most-watched live sporting events ever on the Internet. A few days later, Akamai provided the video streaming, website acceleration and web security services for 25 broadcasters of NBC's online coverage of the Winter Games in Sochi. This was the first time -- first Olympic Games where all of the competitions were streamed live. In March, we delivered 21 million live video streams for March Madness. And just a few weeks ago, we helped IBM deliver the Masters Golf Tournament to 1.7 million viewers, with advanced functionality such as multiple camera views, live stream packaging and audience analytics. I had the opportunity to meet with several of our large media customers last month at the NAB show in Las Vegas, and the positive feedback I received was a powerful validation of our success in delivering quality video at scale. I was especially pleased to hear one major media executive use the word flawless when describing his experience with our team. People often underestimate just how challenging it really is to deliver high-quality video over the Internet at scale. Delivering great quality video to large audiences presents huge technical and financial hurdles for both content owners and service providers. This is an area where Akamai has repeatedly proven its capabilities while others have struggled. In fact, some of you may have seen recent news stories citing concerns about the Internet's ability to scale following the failures of some other smaller media events handled by our competitors. Internet scalability is a very important issue. Akamai has always believed that if you try to deliver large volumes of video from a few data centers or through peering points, you were going to have capacity problems that will result in poor performance or failures. That is why our approach has always been different. We deliver video from servers in thousands of locations that are close to end users where there is far greater capacity and much lower latency, and that has been a key reason why Akamai has succeeded where others have failed. As Jim mentioned, Akamai does not generate large amounts of revenue for delivering the live events that I have referenced. I have called out these events today because they demonstrate our unique capabilities to deliver high-quality video at scale, and these capabilities are responsible for a large portion of Akamai's revenue and growth. It is also worth noting that an increasing portion of the revenue that we receive from media events is for other services, like website acceleration and web security. In fact, we believe that a key reason that you didn't see headlines about any of these websites being attacked is because they were protected by Akamai. The lack of headlines doesn't mean that the attackers didn't try to corrupt the sites or to take them offline. All high-profile events are prime targets. It's just that the attackers were thwarted by our security protection. In general, cyber attacks are continuing to grow rapidly in terms of their frequency, scale and sophistication, with many attacks resulting in significant economic or reputational damage to enterprises, governments and end users. The enormous volume of many attacks can easily overwhelm the defenses traditionally deployed by major enterprises. That's because the attacker can induce large numbers of well-connected devices to flood a target with traffic, but the enterprise typically cannot amass the infrastructure needed to absorb or filter the attack using traditional defenses. That's where Akamai's unique approach makes a big difference. Our servers are in thousands of locations at the edge of the Internet where there's plenty of capacity. By leveraging our massively distributed platform as an outer layer of defense to absorb large-scale attacks and to filter out malicious application layer exploits, we have been able to protect major enterprises in situations where their traditional approaches have failed. Moreover, Akamai has integrated our performance capabilities into our security solutions, which means that our defensive shield can be applied without hurting performance. As a result, Akamai Security Solutions can be deployed in a proactive, always-on manner, which is an important advantage for Akamai in the security arena. Performance degradation is a challenge with traditional security products, and so they are often only turned on after the damage from the attack has occurred. Needless to say, that is often too late for the enterprise. Because of our unique abilities to defend websites and applications, security is our fastest-growing product segment. At the end of the first quarter, and not counting Prolexic, 867 customers were using our security products including over 100 leading banks, and over 260 customers had purchased our flagship Kona Site Defender solution. Including Prolexic, we had over 1,250 customers using one or more of our security products at the end of Q1. We are now in the process of integrating Prolexic capabilities with Kona Site Defender to form a combined security services stack. We are also investing to extend Prolexic's managed security services to include Kona. This will enable us to provide customers with a comprehensive portfolio of security solutions designed to defend an enterprise's web and IT infrastructure against application layer, network layer and data center attacks delivered via the Internet. In closing, Q1 was a fantastic start to the year. The fundamentals across our business are strong, and we are continuing to drive innovation across all of our solution lines to help solve the major challenges our customers face in delivering a fast, reliable and secure web experience on any device anywhere. Thank you for your time today. Now Jim and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I wanted to go into 2 subjects. The first one is the media delivery. You mentioned some of the large events. How -- as well as some of the software patches in gaming. How should we think about that flow or that volume as we look out, not only for the June quarter that you've given us guidance, but for the back half of the year? Is there additional catalysts and things that you already see that can continue that momentum? James Benson : Sure. So I'll take that. So you're right. We had a very strong quarter in Q1, and we talked about this in the past that obviously, there's variability in our media business due to traffic. And it can be variable due to large software downloads, gaming releases that happened in one quarter and maybe don't happen in the next. We happen to have a very strong quarter pretty much across the board in media. We did well in social media. We did well in video. We did well in software download and gaming. So pretty much all the areas that I've talked about in the past. But what was notable in Q1 was we had some large, unplanned software downloads that benefited the quarter and which is really what drove us to be above our guidance, as well as some gaming releases. So it was a very strong software download and gaming quarter. It's tough to say going forward. I think what happened is that I think software downloads really are a little bit more consistent than they've been in the past. But when you have large ones like the ones that occurred, they do cause a spike in traffic and revenue in the quarter. And you're going to see those -- are you going to see them next quarter? Are you going to see them in the back half of the year? I'm sure we will, but there's a level of variability to them that I just really can't call out specifically. I can tell you that within my guidance range for the second quarter, certainly at the midpoint, we're expecting to have a very good media quarter again in Q2 going towards kind of the low end of the range, maybe traffic decelerates going towards the high end of the range, maybe traffic accelerates a little bit more. So really the variable probably for Q2 whether we're going to be at the high or the low end is going to be what happens in media. Does that help? Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then the security and performance, you mentioned the good signings in the quarter. How much of that is just the interest level in customers in the product portfolio that you've got versus can you talk to us about the topic we've talked many times which is the productivity of the sales hires that you've added over the last year? James Benson : Yes, so I'll kind of bifurcate the 2. So we had a very, very strong security signings quarter. And as I mentioned kind of in my opening comments, they were strong across our Kona Security Solutions and our new Prolexic security solution. So we were quite pleased that we're starting to get some traction with our sales organization being more comfortable selling security. I think also the addition of the Prolexic sales resources have certainly helped that. So again, a very strong signings quarter for security. As far as productivity, we continue to add more sales reps in the quarter as we've talked about. I'm not going to talk about how many we're going to add for the year, other than I -- as I mentioned in the last call, that we're probably going to add a similar magnitude of people this year as we did last year. And largely speaking, kind of the productivity of the sales reps by cohort class are performing pretty well. There's going to be some quarters where they perform better than others. But I'd say on average, we're doing well on productivity. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. I just wanted to dig in sort of the strength in security in the quarter, and obviously there was at least one very high-profile security threat this quarter. Does that impact the demand for your security solutions at all? Is it -- do you start to see customers sort of scrambling to address the very high-profile threat and that has an impact in Q1 or in your pipelines going forward? Or is it a little smoother than that? And I'm just sort of curious if that had any accelerating effect on your security business at all. F. Thomson Leighton : By the threat, do you mean the heartbleed bug? Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Yes. F. Thomson Leighton : Yes, I think the heartbleed situation shows why you want to have your secure communications and your commerce sites and banking traffic with Akamai. If you're an Akamai customer, your communication, that bug would've been patched 3 days before it was publicly released. And so when it was released, if people try to exploit it then, if you're on Akamai, you're fine. If you were trying to do it yourself or using a lot of our competitors, you would've been exposed at that time. Now I don't think that caused necessarily a lot of people to run and sign up with Akamai. But it's, again, another validation of why you want your HTTPS or your secure traffic on the Akamai platform. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. And Jim, I just wanted to dig in to the margin guidance a little bit around the second half of the year being slightly lower than even Q2, which fully has the Prolexic business integrated in. And as we think about those expenditures, you've already kind of talked about the sales hiring for the year. Is that -- where are those investments going to be? Are they on the product side? On the sales side? How should we think about what's going to be incremental in the second half versus purely just getting the Prolexic cost layered into the business, which we should see in Q2? James Benson : Sure. So you're -- certainly for Q2, Q2 was much more of a -- you have a full quarter now of Prolexic. But as we talked about in the past, put Prolexic aside for a moment, we've been making investments in the company. We will add more sales reps in Q2 and the back half of the year. We're going to add more go-to-market support capacity for those sales reps. We're going to continue to add more service professionals. You see that we have a very healthy services business. So we'll continue to add more services professionals. We're going to continue to add more R&D resources to really accelerate kind of R&D innovation. And then in addition to that, there are some infrastructure costs that we're building out. So we are adding cost because we're building out more facilities as we add more headcount. And as we add more headcount, we have to build out more IT-related spending. So it's in all those outlined areas. And the reason I wanted to be quite specific about the back half of the year is it -- the company's going to continue to make these investments. And I've been talking in the past about low 40s EBITDA, and I felt it was probably appropriate to be a little bit more specific for you. And obviously, where you land at the low or the high end of that will be how strong revenue is in the back half. And as you know, in Q3, Q3 is notably in the summer, seasonally softer as far as revenue because it's not as much viewing of content on the Internet. And so seasonally, from Q2 to Q3, revenue doesn't grow as much. And if we are continuing to make the investments that I mentioned and revenue doesn't grow as much, it'll put pressure on EBITDA in the short term. But I want to assure you that we're still planning and committed to operating within the guidepost that I mentioned around 40% to 45% EBITDA. And there'll be periods where you're at the low end, and there'll be periods where you're at the high end. I think we're just going through a period of investment right now that we believe the company will be able to scale better going forward and have more sustainable long-term revenue growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : So obviously a very strong quarter and a very strong guide. Some of the upside in 2Q, as you said, came from gaming, some of the -- and software downloads you said, some of which was -- some of which is unanticipated. But the 2Q guidance is very robust also. So what gives you -- and the kind of similar sequential growth rate. So what gives you the visibility, if you had the unanticipated step in 1Q, what gives you the visibility into 2Q to have a similar seasonal guide and not say, hey, this was a little bit of a onetime -- a little bit of a one-timer. James Benson : Yes, no, it's a good question. I mean, I think within kind of a 3-month window that especially with our large customers, you usually have a pretty good idea of what they're going to do. You are right. There were times where even though you don't understand, that they're going to have an unplanned patch. So some of that is really a function of we have very good communication with our customers on what they're going to do. But sometimes, these patches are patches that they are not even planning on that takes place. You also got to remember that Q1 to Q2, we're going to have a full quarter of Prolexic. So we had $7 million of Prolexic in Q1. You'll obviously get now 7 more weeks of Prolexic since we only had 6 weeks in Q1. So some of it's Prolexic. But even if you adjust for Prolexic, you're right, it is still a strong guide, and I think it reflects what we believe is continued strength in the business. And in particular, as I mentioned in my comments that I believe it's going to be more the media side that's going to be the driver of whether we'll be -- we're at the high end or the low end. And I just think it's important that we provide you guys a range of where we think we're going to be and what the driver of that is. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : So again, the visibility into next quarter, you said you have a feel in what your customers can do. Is that, again, on the software downloading and gaming side? James Benson : It's pretty much across the board. It's across our video delivery customers. It's across our download customers, gaming customers, social media customers. So it's pretty much across the board. Specifically, with your large customers, as we talked about, that this has been several quarters in a row where we had particularly strong growth across our large strategic accounts. And large strategic accounts can move the needle in a quarter when their business starts to pick up, or there is a large gaming release or there is a large software release. So I'm pretty confident in the range that I provided. And as I said, I think at the midpoint, it's another strong quarter. At the high end, it means that the traffic growth continues to accelerate even beyond what we saw in Q1 and maybe you have some more unplanned patches and things of that nature. And at the low end, it says things are still strong but maybe not as strong as what we saw in Q1. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Jim, can I squeeze one more in? Can you -- obviously you're giving us essentially EBITDA guide into the back half of the year, which we really appreciate. But can you talk a little bit about, if you could, about depreciation? Depreciation came in a little above where we were looking for this quarter, granted it's just our model, but then you had brought on a new company. Anything to help us out there in terms of what depreciation looks like in the back half or 2Q and into the back half? James Benson : Yes, I'm not going to guide on depreciation specifically, but I think maybe a little bit of it, Michael, is that as you know, we changed our depreciation methodology last year, in Q1 of last year, which effectively lengthened the depreciable life of our network assets from 3 years to 4 years. And we got a benefit, as we mentioned, all last year of assets that were on our books as of the end of 2012. And so there's a little bit of a compare headwind for us when you look at 2014. But you -- I think the way to think about it is that we had a pretty -- even though we came in where we thought, CapEx was kind of in the, call it, the $84 million range in Q1. We said $90 million to kind of $95 million in Q2. So you're seeing that -- now admittedly, when you double-click on that CapEx, actually the network CapEx, with the exception of Prolexic, is actually pretty flat as a percent of revenue. It's probably around 8% of revenue, which is roughly what we've been operating at. So really where we're seeing more CapEx, which probably leads to less depreciation is when you're doing leasehold improvements and IT buildout because that gets depreciated over a longer life. But I think what we try to do is give you enough information for Q2 that you can almost back into what the depreciation guidance is, because I gave you EBITDA, I gave you EPS, I gave you the tax rate. You can kind of assume what interest income is going to be because it's roughly what it's been in the past and you can kind of back into depreciation. So I think that will at least help you understand maybe what depreciation is going to be for Q2, so it will help you build your model for Q3 and Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Justin Rowley - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : It's just Justin on for Heather. Nice quarter. I think a question you get a lot from investors is where does Akamai fit in the conversation about net neutrality. So if we just assume that ISPs are indeed going to be allowed to get preferential treatment from certain customers, presumably at higher cost, can you guys help us frame where Akamai shakes out in this? And maybe a scenario where you could see yourselves benefiting and then if there's any negative consequences, that would be helpful. F. Thomson Leighton : Yes, there's, as you know, a lot of discussion going on in Washington and in other countries, and it's not yet clear what laws are going to get passed and if and how the rules will be changed. But Akamai is in a very good position here. We work closely with both sides, the content folks and the carriers and both of our customers and partners. And really, if you want to think of Akamai as providing the technology that enables the performance, and it enables high-quality video at scale. And that we do all this in a way that reduces cost for the ecosystem. So really, however the rules shake out, there is going to be a need for what we do, and we're closely tied to both sides and I think in a very good position to supply the technology that's going to be needed to have a better Internet, to have a video quality at scale and of course, to have security at affordable price points. So I think -- I like where Akamai sits in the ecosystem as this debate unfolds. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I had a question on the services business. You talked about the strong attach rate again and certainly, the trend line there as just a percent of total continues to move higher. I guess the question I have is a lot of the sales hiring you've made here recently seem to be focused on more \"enterprise-type products\" that may require even further services, and that business is at a lower margin. So could you just talk about maybe where you think that business goes as a percent of total over time and just sort of how you manage the margin of that business over that period of time as well? James Benson : Yes, you're right. Certainly, the sales reps that we're adding, and as we've talked about for our performance in Security Solutions, which is effectively an enterprise sell, that most, if not all, of those customers when they're buying those offers, and even our media solutions, that they are interested in buying kind of -- attaching services. And just to be clear, our services are product enablement focused. So we're not in the services business that is providing kind of consulting and support. This is a product enablement services business. But I think what you've seen is that it wasn't that many years ago where effectively, the services that -- we were not monetizing services. We've put together packages for services, and we found huge interest from our customers who want to get more expertise from our service professionals and helping them leverage how they use the Internet and how they use our solutions. So some of it is that we have very good traction, and you're right. I talked about good attach rates with services. I had mentioned this quarter as well that these large events that I mentioned, the media events that take place over kind of a longer period of time, many customers rely on our service professionals to help deliver those events for them. So what you saw in Q1 was kind of some event-driven services revenue. But you are right that I think 2 years ago, services revenue was about 7% of our revenue. Last year, services revenue was 8% of our revenue. If you look at just Q1, I think that's about 9%. It's probably going to be somewhere, call it, in the 9% to 10% range. I would say we're not throttling back services. If it's leading to more ability for customers that want to buy more of our performance products, buy more of our security products, buy more of our media products, which we've actually proven that it does, we'll continue to grow the services business. You are right. I provided a model for you guys that it is a lower gross margin and EBITDA model, but it's still pretty attractive gross margin and EBITDA model. So I think the way you have to look at the company is we are a blend of a media business. We are blend of kind of these Infrastructure as a Service/SaaS business in performance and security, and we have a services component. And when you look at that, the company has a pretty attractive overall model. And so I don't want you to think that we're throttling services. But you can kind of think of it as we'll continue to grow it in line with as long as it continues to be product enablement-oriented and drive more stickiness of our solutions, that's really the strategy that we have with that part of the portfolio. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : And just a quick follow-up, if I could. If that sort of stabilizes, just for conversation's sake, if that stabilizes at roughly 10% of the mix, is the cost sort of what it is? Or does -- are there opportunities for you to possibly raise the margin within services? James Benson : I mean, it's obviously -- we're working every day and not just our network costs and trying to drive network cost down. We do the same thing in the services business. There's a lot of work of the services team is doing to try to drive down the cost of delivering service. Some of that is tools. Some of that is making it more self-serviceable. So there's a bunch of things we're doing that are focused on margins and services, just like we're focusing on margins in media and focusing on margins in our performance and security solutions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Just a few. So first off, I just wanted to get an update on where we are in the Ion and Alta upgrade opportunity. I know that that's -- the last few quarters had been a driver. I'm just trying to get a sense of where we are in that opportunity. The second thing is, Jim, just to clarify your comments around CapEx. You said CapEx will be at the higher end of the long-term range. I think that range is now 14% to 16%. But if I look back really the last 3 or 4 years, you've been above 16%. So you're effectively just calling out that, that same trend that we've really been seeing for a while now is simply going to sustain. Or is it actually going to go even higher than, call it, 16%, 16.5% or so where we've been? And then just point of clarification as well on servers, you added just 2,065 servers in the quarter. Just going through my model, last time it was low was the second quarter of 2009. Just wonder if there's anything to call out there. F. Thomson Leighton : Yes, in terms of the upgrade opportunity for Ion and Alta, I would say we're in the early stages. The Ion product provides excellent performance gains, particularly in the most challenging environments, countries that are relatively small and for example, cellular environments, which are challenged in terms of congestion and latency. And we're seeing upsell when customers upgrade from DSA to Ion, which is great. We are also combining it with a protect and a perform offer. So it can go out there with -- and sell it with Kona, and that's been successful. So we're in the early stages and a long way to go in terms of realizing benefit from Ion and Alta. James Benson : Yes, and I'll take the CapEx question. So I think we need to clarify, so we've been operating at about 16% of revenue for the last couple of years, and that is the high end of our long-term model. But to be clear, what I said is I think we're going to be slightly above the high end of our long-term model. But you have to double-click on our CapEx, which is basically 3 areas : one is network CapEx, one is capitalized software and the third is facility and IT. And network CapEx has scaled very nicely for the company over the last 2 years and actually this quarter. So it wasn't that many years ago that network CapEx was over 10% of revenue. Network CapEx is now in the 7% to 8% of revenue range. So network CapEx is scaling very nicely. Capitalized software has been increasing, and it's about 5% of revenue. And you've got to think of that as that really is because we capitalize R&D, that is really new product innovation. And so I consider that kind of good CapEx. Where we notably had a large uptick in CapEx, we had a large uptick last year. And I think we're going to have an even more notable uptick this year is in facility and IT. You don't add the number of resources that we have without the need to build out facilities and without the need to add kind of related IT expense. So we're going through a period that I believe is going to continue this year, that is going to be more substantive facility and IT buildout. I don't think you're going to see those volumes going into 2015, but you are in 2014. And so I think that -- you got to kind of look at our CapEx and break it out because I think there are some notable things going on which is nice scale within the network. And notably, we're going through a period, as you invest in headcount, that you're going to need kind of, call it, infrastructure buildout for them that should not be CapEx that you need to do every year. You have to try to get ahead of it now. Does that help? Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Yes, it's just that it didn't seem like there was really much of a change. So I was just curious what you're calling out just based on what you've actually been doing, but that's helpful. And just quickly on the servers? James Benson : So there's nothing notable on the servers. I mean, we have more efficient servers that we put -- every quarter and every year, we're working on what are the -- what is kind of the server design that we're looking for. And every year, we get more efficient servers, which gives us more throughput. So that's really what's going on in the server front. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Fetyko with ABR Investment Strategy. Richard Fetyko : Just curious on the international side, if you could tell us if the mix of revenue among your segments is different from the U.S. and which product specifically within the performance and solutions side perhaps is driving the growth? Or are you leading with the media-delivered typically solutions? James Benson : It's good -- I mean, the mix is relatively similar outside the U.S. as it is in the U.S. kind of media versus performance, security and service and support. So I mean, the mix is not materially different. You are right that we certainly have more -- we have more greenfield opportunity outside the U.S. And so it's easier for a sales rep, when you add them, to probably go and sell our media products for us and then sell performance and security second. But it's something that we look at, but I would say that there's really not a notable difference in kind of the mix of the offerings in any of the regions. Richard Fetyko : Okay. And just to follow up on the earlier questions around the professional services revenue growth. Which product tend to have the highest attach rates for services? James Benson : Well, I think -- probably it's -- we -- again, it's product-enablement services. So in some cases, think of it as their support packages where you get a higher level of response. So those are getting a good uptake. I think there's also -- some of these are packages where we're selling them with, say, our security solutions. And they are being bundled into our security solutions where we're providing a Web Application Firewall to the customer. And the -- basically, the rule settings need to be updated. And so we're able to sell a service package which actually have services resources working with the customer to continue to update the rule setting based on different security threats so that the customer wants update on an ongoing basis. So I think it varies, but I'd say we're probably getting stronger attach rate in the performance and security solutions than we are on the media solutions because those tend to be more sophisticated offerings that require more of our services professionals. But hopefully that gave you a little bit of color on the type of offerings that are doing well within the services. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair. James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Just a couple of questions, one with respect to the product set and the performance and security solutions. Any color you can give us on the customers -- existing customers that are now taking a security solution? Is that sort of the grow -- fastest-growing segment of products? And then how many of the total customers are taking a security solution now versus where we were a couple of months ago and does Prolexic help that? James Benson : Yes, I mean, I don't think anything has notably changed. I mean, we shared with you guys at the Investor Summit just a month or so ago kind of the penetration of our solution -- our security solution and the penetration of our performance solutions with our customers. So I don't think it notably changed since then. I do -- I would say, though, that obviously we've had Prolexic. It was 6 weeks in the quarter. I mentioned that we had very good signings. I think the strong interest from our customers in both our Prolexic offerings and our Kona offerings. So we're pretty pleased kind of early days here with the integration and the interest from customers in our security offerings. And I think I shared with you guys in the past that security is a different sale, and our sales professionals were much more accustomed selling performance. And I think they're getting more comfortable selling security, and I think the addition of the Prolexic sales reps and us having maybe more of a sales specialist model on the security side is actually leading to additional traction in security that we hope that we can continue going forward. James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : And with respect to Prolexic, you've talked about it being a $5 million a month in terms of revenue. Is there really any EBITDA associated with this year? So as we think about margins in the back half, can we assume that's sort of revenue without EBITDA attached to it? James Benson : Yes, I think the way to think about it is it's certainly, in the early goings, it's not -- it's more cost than revenue. And then I think probably as you go towards the outer part of the year, it'll probably be revenue and cost in alignment. But in the early goings, it's more spending than revenue. But obviously, we expect to continue to grow the Prolexic business that we think that you'll see probably by the end of the year, call it, neutral EBITDA. And then beyond that, our expectation in 2015 is you'll start to see some scale. Again, we're not going to separate Prolexic from the rest of our security business, but that's kind of generally the way to think about it. James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And then just last -- one last question on the media delivery solutions. As you sell more internationally, given your footprint globally and sort of lack of maybe underlying wireline infrastructure globally, is there an opportunity there in pricing in that segment to be better outside the U.S. than it is in the U.S. and will that help over time? James Benson : I mean, certainly, the market dynamics are different in every geography. And so certainly, the price points for a U.S. customer for kind of that we price our media solutions are different than the price points that you're going to charge someone, say, in the Japanese market. But that's more a function of the local market dynamics. So it's tough to kind of -- you can't make a general statement. I think it depends upon the market and the cost associated with delivering services in those markets. And that's really -- we price based on local market conditions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie. Unknown Analyst : This is Will filling in for Kevin. I know you touched on international a little, but I was wondering if you could give us any more color on the strength of bookings and the difference between EMEA and Asia Pac. And also, would you be able to break out the Prolexic revenue by geography? James Benson : So we're not going to break out bookings between Europe and APJ. We -- that's just not something that we're going to do. I can give you a little bit of color on that, that we continue to make good traction. Growth has been very strong in Asia Pacific. It's been strong for a while. I think growth in Asia Pacific has been a little bit more media-oriented. I think we saw some nice improvement in growth rates in Europe. Europe is still suffering from some of the southern markets of Europe, from just a macroeconomic perspective are still not performing well. But I think generally speaking, both markets are performing well, and we expect over time that these markets are going to grow faster than our U.S. markets. Now that's an over time comment. And what was your other question? Unknown Analyst : About the Prolexic revenue, if you could break that out. James Benson : Yes, so the Prolexic's mix, I think, was about, if I remember it right, it's about 40% of their mix was in international, 60% in the U.S., roughly speaking. So it's a little bit more concentrated in international than the Akamai business, but not notably. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire from CLSA. Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division : I was wondering if you could just discuss the competitive environment in the core media solutions business, and at least any discussions around some of your customers that may be large media customers that may be trying build-outs of their own because that's a recurring theme, particularly at the low end of the market, and how that may be informing some of the discussions you're having. F. Thomson Leighton : Yes, media remains a very competitive business. There's a lot of competitors there. Price is an important consideration obviously. So there's no fundamental change in those dynamics. The good news is traffic's increasing at a rapid rate, and of course, pricing per bit delivered continues to decline. And as always, the largest -- the few largest media customers continue to try do-it-yourself solutions. I expect that to continue in the future as well. In some cases, they've actually tried in the past and now are coming out of that phase. As I mentioned before, it is much harder than folks think to really do video at high quality and at scale. And you -- it seems like a good idea at the time. And so you embark on a project and after few years, suddenly you're not current anymore and it's a lot more expensive than you thought. And so Akamai is in this for the long game, but I expect it to be -- continue to be a competitive environment and it's up to us to deliver better performance at better scale and affordable price point. Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Great. And just a quick follow-up, do you have any concentration of large contracts up for renewal in the next quarter or 2? James Benson : Yes, I mean -- I think I've said this before that every quarter we have kind of notable customers that are renewing. I did mention the -- our largest media customer, only because of its size. We don't have any customer that's near that size. So every quarter, we see large customers that renew, but there's nothing kind of extraordinary that is going to take place over the next quarter or so. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley Caris, Research Division : I'm going to focus this on security. Now that you have Prolexic and you see how it works, can you think of other solutions that you could tuck in and patch, maybe it's internal, maybe through acquisition? But is there opportunity to continue to grow synergistically? Second question would be those competitor out there talking about them blocking the largest DDoS attack, probably in Europe, I think. And the size of the attack, if I remember the number correctly, was above kind of the peak rate that you had given out during your Investor Summit. So if you -- what do you need to build out to get after these bigger attacks, which some of your competitors are throwing out? Or do you think there's -- your number would account for 80% of the DDoS attacks out there? F. Thomson Leighton : All right. So first question, we're always looking for new capabilities and technology across all of our solution lines, including security, and of course, you saw us make the Prolexic acquisition. We're also doing a lot of internal innovation and development across our solution lines, including in security. If we find a company out there that has a great technology that we can bring to market for the benefit of our customers and it makes financial sense to do the transaction, then we'll do that. In terms of -- I'm not sure what you're referring to in Europe, but I think Akamai has been uniquely capable of defending against the largest attacks that are out there, and we've got a great track record of doing that where others have not been successful. We will continue to build out our infrastructure for delivery, as well as defense and security purposes. So that's an ongoing situation. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Sanderson from MKM Partners. Rob Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division : Did make it in under the wire. Question on channel sales. Revenue contribution from resellers jumped quite a lot this quarter, and you called out carrier partnerships. Is this mostly in the media or the performance and security? And is this an unusual quarter, or do you think carriers are starting to become sustainably better resellers of your products? James Benson : Yes, so really there's not -- it's not anything notable with the carriers as far as the difference kind of necessarily in the mix. They tend to sell enterprise-class products. So they'll sell all of our products but -- they'll sell media and performance and security. You are right. It was notable that we saw an uptick in our channel business, and in particular with the carriers. So part of it is that we've had good traction with our channel partners. We announced quite a few of them last year, and I think we're starting to see some traction with some of them. I do think it's probably important to note, though, that for some of these very, very large channel partners, part of the relationship that we have with them is we also help them by seeding them a little bit with their business to get them started. So there were some customers that we had on the direct side that we have seeded these -- some of these large carriers to get them going and get the business moving with them. So we've had traction both in selling offerings through the carrier. And admittedly, we've had some of that driven by, call it, the movement of some accounts that were on the direct side that we seeded to the partner. But across the board, I'd say we're pretty pleased with traction in the reseller space, and the fastest-growing reseller that we have are with carrier partners. And as we've talked about in the past, our expectation is that they will be the fastest-growing channel for us, and they're very important to Akamai's future growth. Rob Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division : Just a follow-up, if I could, on the -- back to the -- not to kill this one, but the margin guidance in the back half of the year, 40% to 42%. It seems like a downtick from what I think was interpreted to be 42% prior. Did something change in terms of your investment plans as you bring Prolexic in-house? Or is that just -- or has something changed there? James Benson : No, nothing's changed other than -- certainly, I'm as aware of kind of how the street models the company as you are. And when I said low 40s, you're right. If someone says low 40s means 42%, I want to be very clear. A low 40s could mean something that's 40% to 42%, just to be clear, and it's going to be dependent upon revenue volumes. And I gave you guys an example of what could happen in the third quarter, just seasonally what happens Q2 to Q3. I'm not suggesting that's going to happen, but I'm trying to provide you a little bit of color so that we don't surprise you if in fact the company operates at those levels and you say, \"Why didn't you tell me that?\" I'm trying to signal to you what we intend to operate the company at. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : You didn't touch too much on mobility on the call, and I was just wondering if you're winning many contracts on mobility and what you're seeing in terms of the ability to kind of improve latency on mobile networks and kind of how important that is for customers at this point. F. Thomson Leighton : Yes, mobility is really critical across all of our product lines. We're nearing the point where a majority of the transactions are going to be on mobile devices, and that's a stunning increase from where we were a few years ago. And of course, as you know, that mobile is a place that's often very challenged in terms of performance, especially if you're on a cellular network where the congestion can be very high and the latencies are high. And that's where our Ion service is really great because it's really focused on mobile. And we have real user measurements now, so you can actually see how real users on the site are experiencing the site. You can see what kind of device they have, what browser they have, what carrier they're on, and you can see what their performance is. And the results we have, have been really great : dramatic speedups even in the most challenging cellular environments. So we don't break out mobile because -- well, pretty -- a lot of the business is becoming mobile. It just -- it goes with the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to hit on gross margins again. They're strong. A tick above where your guidance range was. Just maybe just give us a little more detail on the sort of what you're seeing in terms of colo, bandwidth. And then I know you guys are doing sort of constant grooming of the network. But I guess sort of where do we stand in this process? And obviously, you've given a long-term guidance. Maybe if you could just help us out, walk through that and just what you saw this quarter, that would be great. James Benson : Sure. So again, it -- this quarter was another good quarter. I think we guided -- we had said 78%. So our cash gross margins were certainly as we thought. They were flat to Q4. But again, we continue to do a good job with managing bandwidth costs, managing colocation spending. And we've talked about a lot of the things that we're doing, whether they are driving kind of software initiatives to get more throughput out of the servers, whether it's installing more efficient servers into the network. There's a bunch of things that we're doing, and we're going to continue to do. It is fair to say that certainly, we talked much more about the network side. Certainly, a piece of our cost of goods sold is the services side. As our services business grows, we will have to add services resources there. So it's probably important for us to make sure that we remind you that our gross margins are not just driven by what we do on managing network cost. They're also driven by kind of what happens with the revenue mix portfolio for the customer and -- or for our revenue mix. And so if we end up having more services revenue, that services revenue kind of has, call it, low 50s gross margins, which is very different than our media and our performance and security solutions. But I think, again, a very good quarter in Q1. It's been good the last couple of years. We think we can continue the momentum that we made there and, call it, the guide that we have for Q2 is we're absorbing Prolexic. And as a reminder, Prolexic's offering does have service professionals that are working within that offering. So some of our kind of erosion so to speak in EBITDA, you'll see some of that possibly on the gross margin line largely because of Prolexic or a fair amount of Prolexic's cost were in services cost of goods sold. F. Thomson Leighton : So we'd like to thank you all for joining us today. We're obviously very pleased to have a great Q1, and we're very optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead in Q2 and beyond. Tom Barth : Thank you, Tom. This is Tom Barth. I want to, again, thank you for joining us and just to remind you that we'll report Q2 results on July 30 after the market, and we look forward to speaking to many of you soon. Thank you, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may all now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

My name is Derrick, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Tom Barth : Thank you, Derrick, and good afternoon, and thank you all for joining Akamai's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. But before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on July 30, 2014. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom. F. Thomson Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q2 was another excellent quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue in the second quarter was a record $476 million, up 26% over Q2 of 2013 and coming in near the high end of our guidance range. We had solid growth in all of our geographies and in all of our major product lines, with especially strong growth for our security and media products. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $106 million or $0.58 per diluted share. That's also up 26% over Q2 of 2013. This strong result exceeded the high end of our guidance range due to strong operational execution and a favorable tax rate. I'll be back in a few minutes to talk more about our achievements in the second quarter. But first, let me turn the call over to Jim to review our financial results in detail and to provide the outlook for Q3. Jim? James Benson : Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Akamai had a great second quarter and a very strong first half of the year. As Tom outlined, Q2 revenue came in near the high end of our guidance range at $476 million, up 5% sequentially and up 26% year-over-year with strong growth across the entire business. Looking at our performance by solution category. Our media delivery solutions revenue was $216 million in the quarter, up 1% sequentially and up 20% year-over-year. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased with the growth in media coming off a very strong first quarter. Traffic and revenue growth accelerated across most of our customer base, with particularly strong growth coming from our gaming, video and social media customers. Again this quarter, we delivered some high-profile live events, most notably the recent World Cup matches, which set peak traffic records and contributed modestly to the media revenue achievement. More important than the media -- the revenue contributions, however, these live events highlight our unique ability to deliver high-quality live streaming content at very large scale. Turning to our performance and security solutions. Revenue was $217 million in the quarter, up 10% sequentially and up 30% year-over-year. And for the first time, we had more revenue in a quarter from performance and security solutions than Media Delivery, which speaks to the growing diversification of our revenue base. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth in our web performance solutions. And as Tom mentioned, we saw very strong growth in our cloud security solutions. Net new signings were especially strong for our security offerings, and for Prolexic, in particular, another proof point of early traction with our Prolexic integration and also increased customer demand for our overall cloud security portfolio. Finally, revenue from our services and support solutions was $42 million in the quarter, up 4% sequentially and up 35% year-over-year. We continue to see solid performance in attaching enterprise-class professional services and customer support to our core business solutions. Switching now to our geographies. Revenue growth continued to be well-balanced across all our major theaters. Sales in our international markets represented 28% of total revenue in Q2, consistent with both the prior quarter and Q2 of 2013. International revenue grew 3% sequentially and 27% year-over-year, with currency fluctuations having a positive impact on revenue of approximately $1 million on a sequential basis and about $3 million on a year-over-year basis. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, international revenue grew 2% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. We continue to see strong growth in our Asia Pacific geography and improved performance in our EMEA markets, primarily driven by strength in our performance and security offerings. Revenue from our U.S. market grew 6% sequentially and 25% year-over-year with very balanced growth across all solution categories. And finally, revenue through resellers represented 25% of total revenue in Q2, up 1 point from the prior quarter and up 5 points from the prior year. This increase was due to continued traction with our carrier partners in particular and contributions from Prolexic's strong channel relationships. Moving onto costs. As expected, our cash gross margin was 78%, consistent with the prior quarter and up 2 points from the same period last year and coming in at the high end of our guidance range. We were very pleased to see the benefits of our ongoing platform efficiency initiatives offset the impact of the Prolexic acquisition. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 69%, consistent with the prior quarter and up 2 points from the same period last year. GAAP operating expenses were $214 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $166 million, up $15 million from Q1 levels and at the lower end of our expectations, mainly due to planned hiring shifting into the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $204 million, consistent with Q1 levels and up 23% from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 43%, down 2 points from Q1 levels and down 1 point from Q2 of last year. This result was at the high end of our guidance range for the quarter, driven by a combination of revenue coming in at the higher end of guidance and slightly lower-than-expected operating expenses, as mentioned earlier. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $59 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $48 million, up $4 million from Q1 levels and in line with our expectations. This quarter, we are introducing an additional financial metric : non-GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP operating income is essentially adjusted EBITDA less non-GAAP depreciation expenses. This is an operational measure we review internally and believe is a useful supplemental metric for investors since it captures the depreciation related to our day-to-day operations that the adjusted EBITDA metric does not. And it is also not impacted by taxes, which can move around quarterly for nonoperational reasons. This is also a common metric that many of our peers provide. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $156 million, down 2% from Q1 levels and up 20% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 33%, down 2 points from Q1 levels and down 1 point from Q2 of last year. Moving on to other income and expense items. Interest income for the second quarter was roughly $2 million, consistent with Q1 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $73 million or $0.40 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $106 million for the quarter or $0.58 of earnings per diluted share, about $0.01 higher than the high end of our guidance range, driven primarily by strong revenue achievement, the hiring shift I highlighted earlier and a slightly favorable tax rate. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $36 million, based on a tax rate of 33%. This rate is down 5 points year-over-year primarily due to higher foreign earnings. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $52 million, based on a tax rate of 33% and coming in about 1 point lower than our guidance range, again due to higher foreign earnings. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 181 million shares, down approximately 1 million shares from Q1 levels, primarily due to increased share buyback activity in the first half of the year. Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the second quarter was 60 days, up 2 days from last quarter and 3 days from Q2 of 2013. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $79 million, considerably below our expectations for the quarter due to the timing of planned network, IT and facility buildouts that shifted from Q2 to Q3. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities. Cash flow generation was strong in the second quarter, with free cash flow of $130 million or 27% of revenue. During the quarter, we spent approximately $71 million on share repurchases, buying back about 1.3 million shares at an average price of just under $55. As of Q2 end, we had $550 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $800 million. As we've discussed in the past, we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide us the financial flexibility to enable us to make the best investments at the most opportune times. As always, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our shareholders in a manner we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q2 and the first half of the year. We continued to execute well, delivered strong revenue growth, managed network costs effectively and made investments across the business that we believe will build the foundation for sustained, long-term growth. Looking ahead to Q3, we are expecting another strong quarter with revenue in the range of $484 million to $496 million. This range represents 22% to 25% growth over a very strong third quarter last year. At current spot rates, foreign exchange is expected to be neutral compared to Q2 and a favorable $3 million impact year-over-year. We expect gross margins to remain roughly flat to Q2 levels, with cash gross margins at 78% and GAAP gross margins at 68% to 69%. On the operating expense side, we plan to continue to increase our investment levels in the business. We expect to grow non-GAAP cash operating expenses by $11 million to $15 million on a sequential basis, reflecting our plans to catch up on the hiring shifts from Q2, incremental Q3 hiring and facilities and infrastructure spend to support headcount growth globally. Factoring in the above, we anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins of 41% to 42%, down 1 to 2 points from Q2 levels and consistent with prior messaging of operating the company in the low-40s EBITDA range in the near term. As I have shared in the past, we plan to make the needed investments in the business to drive both scale and growth. And whether we land at the high end or the low end of this EBITDA range will be heavily dependent on revenue performance. As a reminder, the long-term EBITDA model for the company remains at 40% to 45%. Moving on to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $50 million to $52 million, up slightly from Q2 levels. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 31% to 32% for Q3. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.58. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $51 million to $53 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 34%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of roughly 181 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $86 million to $91 million in the second quarter -- in the third quarter, excluding equity compensation. These levels are slightly higher than what we've spent in recent quarters, primarily due to the expected shift in investments from Q2 to Q3 I mentioned earlier. As I outlined in last quarter's call, we are investing in several large facility and IT projects to support the planned growth in scale in the business. And we are also investing to stay ahead of the traffic growth we expect to see on the network, excluding expanding the Prolexic network footprint. Taking into account these important investment areas, we expect full year 2014 CapEx, as a percentage of revenue, to be slightly above our long-term model, again consistent with what I shared on prior calls. In closing, we delivered a strong Q2 and first half of the year, and we expect solid performance through the second half of the year as well. We see promising momentum across the business, and we're making the investment that we believe will drive meaningful and sustained growth for Akamai in 2014 and beyond. Now let me turn the call back over to Tom. F. Thomson Leighton : Thanks, Jim. It's great to see Akamai building on our strong start to the year. I believe that our excellent financial results are evidence of the sound fundamentals across our business and the pivotal role that we play in the growth of the Internet. We are continuing to focus on solving 4 grand challenges for our customers : delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale and affordability; providing near-instant performance for websites and apps on any device, anywhere; securing websites and data centers from attackers that seek to disrupt their operations, corrupt their content or steal their information; and driving speed and affordability into branch office connectivity for major enterprises. The complexity and challenges of delivering high-quality video over the Internet at scale are often underestimated, and the problem is getting even more complicated as online video consumption increases, further raising the technical and financial hurdles faced by both content owners and service providers. As a result, some experts have questioned whether the Internet will be able to scale to support the delivery of high-quality video to large audiences in the future. One of Akamai's strategic goals is to enable the Internet to achieve such scale, and our recent success in streaming the 2014 World Cup to a global audience has proved once again that Akamai is capable of overcoming the bottlenecks inherent in the Internet so that millions of viewers can watch high-quality video events over IP. Akamai achieved several milestones during the recent World Cup. We supported our largest audience ever for a single event, delivering nearly 7 terabits per second of traffic to over 5 million concurrent viewers of the semifinal match between Argentina and the Netherlands on July 9. We set a new total Akamai traffic record of 23 terabits per second during the Brazil-Germany game on July 8. And we delivered over 220 petabytes of World Cup traffic for 55 broadcasters in 80 countries, 2.5x the amount of traffic for the Sochi Olympics and 10x the traffic for the 2010 World Cup. More important than the scale of the event was the quality that we delivered. I was especially pleased to see one of our largest customers characterize Akamai's World Cup performance as \"nothing short of perfect.\" And while the traffic numbers sound impressive, we believe that they are only the tip of the iceberg. We estimate that only a few percent of the total viewing audience for the World Cup was watching online at any given time. This means that there is a tremendous potential for future growth as more viewers watch online and at higher bit rates. Akamai's repeated success in streaming live, global events such as the World Cup and the Olympic Games has proven that our unique approach of delivering content from thousands of locations close to end users afford significant advantages over our competitors when it comes to scaling and securing the Internet. Even though we streamed a record amount of traffic in Q2, this was the first quarter where our performance and security revenue exceeded the revenue from our media business. The 30% year-over-year growth in our performance and security business was fueled in part by the Prolexic acquisition and the significant growth in our overall security portfolio. In Q2, we continued to see substantial increases in both the scale and the sophistication of cyber attacks around the globe. Since the second quarter of 2013, the total number of DDoS attacks we have observed increased by 22%, infrastructure attacks grew by 46%, and the average attack bandwidth expanded by 72%. On a typical day, we are now seeing DDoS attacks in excess of 50 gigabits per second. And earlier this month, we successfully defended a DDoS attack in excess of 320 gigabits per second. By leveraging our massively distributed platform as an outer layer of defense, we have been able to protect enterprises worldwide from such large-scale attacks, which can easily overwhelm traditional defenses. Because of our unique capabilities to defend websites and applications, security has continued to be our fastest-growing product category. At the end of the second quarter, over 1,500 customers were using our security products and over 800 had purchased one or both of our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Solutions. Five months after the close, the Prolexic acquisition has continued to gain positive momentum. The initial integration phase involving people, finance and sales processes has been completed. Customer and employee retention were key priorities for this acquisition, and I am very pleased with our early success in these areas. In the second half of 2014, we are focusing our efforts on technology integration, expansion of the Security Operations Center and buildout of additional network capacity. Overall, Prolexic and Akamai are now operating as one cohesive organization, focused on designing and delivering the industry's most comprehensive portfolio of security solutions. In summary, we have had an excellent first half of the year. Our solid financial performance demonstrates the strength of our business strategy, and we believe that our continued investments in product innovation, sales capacity and platform capabilities are expanding the foundation for our future growth. Thank you for your time today. Now Jim and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs. Unknown Analyst : This is Nicole [ph] in for Heather. I was just wondering about the sales productivity in the quarter. I know there are more tenured reps now, especially in the performance and security business. Could you just give more color on that? James Benson : Yes, so I -- we continue to ramp well with the sales hiring that we've done. We continue to do well on kind of making the reps productive. I think it's important to -- you commented on performance and security. The reps that we hire sell more than performance and security. They sell the entire portfolio. So we have reps that are also selling media solutions as well. So they're not just selling performance and security, but certainly, there's an emphasis on that part of the portfolio. But I'd say, in general, we track the reps by tenure class, and they're kind of tracking to historical levels. Unknown Analyst : Great. And in the media business, did you see any changes in the competitive landscape there? Any pricing pressure? F. Thomson Leighton : I would say that's pretty similar to how it's been for many years. As we've often talked about, there's a lot of competitors. And the very biggest companies also do it themselves, or try to, in some cases. And I anticipate that continuing as we move forward. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Michael Turits, Raymond James. James Wesman : It's James Wesman sitting in for Michael. Jim, just to look at the 3Q revenue guidance for a second. I know you guys did post a fairly seasonal strong Q2. The 3Q guide, though, was a point or 2 below what you guys usually do seasonally in the third quarter. Is that a result of the repricing from your largest customer? Any color around there will be helpful. James Benson : Yes. I think it's important that actually, it's in line with kind of what we usually see seasonally kind of Q2 to Q3. So it's not kind of below that. But to give you a little bit of color on kind of the guidance range, kind of at the midpoint we're expecting another solid quarter. I think we've mentioned in the past, the summer months from a traffic perspective are lighter than other quarters of the year. So certainly, we are expecting some of that. There are a couple of large software releases that are planned towards the back half of the quarter. And effectively, what we're guiding here is that kind of at the midpoint of the range, those software releases, they happen within the quarter and they're kind of in line with the scale that we expect. On a lower end of the range. Maybe some of those software releases push into Q4. But we're pretty confident with kind of the range that we've outlined. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of perspective on kind of the guide. James Wesman : And then, just a follow-up for Tom. Tom, just some insight into the security business. I know Verizon and EdgeCast had rolled out Web Application Firewall offering. Are you guys seeing that at all in your bake-offs to customers? F. Thomson Leighton : Not really, no. We've seen the press there. Our relationship with Verizon continues as it has been with Verizon Enterprise Services. And we don't see a lot of EdgeCast in the marketplace and certainly don't see them in the security area. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Sterling Auty, JPMorgan. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So the investment that you're making in the second half, I want to make sure that I'm clear. How much of the investment is really in the security and performance side versus some of the buildout to support media delivery? And traditionally, you guys have done a good job of kind of building in anticipation of demand. What are the things that you're thinking about specifically that would fill up that capacity investment that you're making? James Benson : Yes. So I think, in general, the investments that we're making are not just weighted to security. We've been making investments across the portfolio, across security, across our kind of cloud networking products, across our web performance products and media. So the investments have been pretty broad from an R&D perspective and also from a go-to-market perspective. So I just want to make sure that -- and those investments we're expecting to continue into the second half of the year. I think to your point about security, we did comment on the last couple calls that we're building out more network expansion, in particular, to support our Prolexic offerings, and we're expecting to do more of that in the second half of the year. And as we've said before, from a CapEx perspective, on the network side, we continue to build out in support of what we believe is the demand that's there. And we know that we can grow into it with traffic. So, effectively, the way to think about it is we build CapEx to support what is an aggressive traffic outlook because we certainly don't want to be turning customers away. And if in fact the traffic is a little bit lighter than we expect in the quarter, you can always grow into it in the following quarter. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then if memory serves me right, in the first 2 quarters of the year, you had some kind of more one-off-ish items, I think, like contracts for IP performance or some specific things that you were doing. Was there anything in that kind of one-off nature that helped -- I'm sorry, in the first quarter, I think it was -- maybe the fourth quarter, but was there anything here in the June quarter that fell into that kind of bucket? James Benson : Not really. We had very good and balanced performance across media and pretty much across all of our solution categories. I think probably the one area that maybe tends to be a little bit more lumpy is our custom government projects. And we didn't have as many of them in Q2, but that's probably the only area. I think, outside of that, we had very strong growth across the portfolio. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Colby Synesael, Cowen. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Great. This, I think, is the second quarter where you've noted that you've pushed out hiring. And I'm trying to get a sense of what's behind that. Is it simply you're having a hard time finding these people? Is there something else there? And then when you think about the momentum you're seeing in the business and the guidance that you laid out for 3Q, is it favoring an acceleration in any particular business, whether it's -- if you just break out the way you look at your revenues, the media business versus performance and security. Just trying to get a sense of what that's going to look like between the 2 businesses. James Benson : Sure. So on the hiring front, I mean, we set some pretty aggressive hiring expectations for ourselves for the year. So it's certainly not a matter of having difficulty hiring people because Akamai is a very attractive company for people to come to. So we're not having an issue whatsoever with attracting talent. We just put together a very aggressive hiring plan. Sometimes, hiring shifts from quarter-to-quarter. We want to make sure, obviously, we're hiring the best people. And so I think that we're quite diligent to make sure that the caliber of people that we're bringing on board are the caliber that we want. Relative to Q3, we're not going to -- I'm not going to guide by business unit. I can tell you that we expect strong growth again across the portfolio. So it isn't weighted to any one area. I'd say you should expect that the growth will be pretty balanced across the portfolio again. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Keller, D. A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : My first one is just a little bit of follow-up to that one. The buildouts shifted as well, was that connected to the hiring? James Benson : No. It's not really connected. I mean, again, we end up -- you end up having to -- for many of these network deployments, they take 3 to 6 months as far as planning. And sometimes, you have vendors and sometimes the vendors are maybe supposed to ship you goods at the end of a quarter and they slip by maybe a week or 2. So you really -- it's really only notable things like that. And then some of the facility expansion that I mentioned, sometimes in certain states and in certain countries, the buildouts take longer based on kind of just challenges with getting permits and things of that nature. There's nothing noteworthy, other than just things that are kind of normal that tend to move kind of from quarter-to-quarter and month-to-month. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Okay. And on the security side, you mentioned Verizon, you're not seeing them there as a competitor. What do you think the growth rate there is in the DDoS security market? Are you maintaining share? Are you taking share? And what's the competitive environment right there? F. Thomson Leighton : I would say our solution, now that we're combined with Prolexic, is very compelling. And we're seeing high growth rates and a lot of traction there. There are a lot of competitors. Our approach is different. It's the new way of doing things, in the cloud. And that's very compelling when you have these large attacks where you really can't defend yourself by buying a box and sticking it in your data center and even your carrier really can't effectively defend you against these very large attacks. So we're seeing excellent traction. And over time, I think you're seeing us take share from the traditional way of doing things and add to the overall growth of the market with a new way of doing things. So the business is growing very rapidly. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jennifer Lowe, Morgan Stanley. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Maybe even following up a little bit on the last set of questions. About -- I think yesterday there was an announcement out in terms of a partnership you all had entered into with Microsoft around investing in security businesses in Israel. And first time I think I've seen you all working with Microsoft, so it was sort of interesting in that regard. And then, obviously, security is a big focus area as well. Can you talk a little bit about that project specifically? What the opportunities you see there are? And how that sort of came about in concert with Microsoft? F. Thomson Leighton : Sure. That's an investment in very early stage startups. Of course, Akamai has its roots in the 50k competition at MIT. And Israel is a great place for hiring security talent. It's a great place for startups and security startups. And so that's a really good place for us to partner with Microsoft in investing and supporting early-stage security companies. You hope for a long-term payoff there. We have a large and growing presence in Israel where we base a lot of our security development. So it's a perfect location for us. We have a great partnership with Microsoft, and it just makes a lot of sense all the way around. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. And then, just shifting gears quickly, one last one for me. As you -- I think in the past you've talked about the potential for acceleration throughout this year as all of the hiring from last year starts to reap productivity and there's a life factor there, but this seems like that this might be the point where we start to see that take hold a little bit. Is that still the expectation as you think about -- and I know the first question got into this a little bit -- but as you see the sales people start to hit the road and start to bring in business, has that trended in line with maybe where you thought that would be 6 months ago? Better or worse? What's sort of the color on that? James Benson : Yes. And I think, in general, there's a lot of things that obviously affect revenue growth, right? The sales productivity is but one aspect. Obviously, traffic volumes, pricing volumes or pricing impacts. There's a lot of things that affect growth, but we are very pleased with the hiring that we made on sales. We are very pleased with kind of the overall productivity that we're seeing across the business. I'm not going to guide beyond the current quarter. You can obviously see from the Q3 guide that we're guiding to a pretty strong guide again, a continuation of what was strong growth in Q1, strong growth in Q2, expected strong growth in Q3. And certainly, the sales reps that we are hiring are selling into the installed base more of our solutions, as well as selling off the installed base. So, in general, I think -- we track it by cohort class. I can't tell you that every single rep is tracking to our expectations because that would -- that's not true, but you wouldn't have expected that anyway. And I think, in general, the reps by cohort class are tracking pretty well, and I think the expectations that we set earlier, we're still comfortable with that and the investments that we're making and the return that we're going to get. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Sameet Sinha, B. Riley. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley Caris, Research Division : Couple of questions. Can you tell us what the contribution was from Prolexic during the quarter? And secondly, you mentioned number of security customers at 1,500. This is up from about 1,250 that you had at the end of Q1. Do you think that is the kind of pace that we should be expecting throughout the year? Or is there anything specific that helped you increase the number of customers by that much this quarter? James Benson : Sure. I think we told you in the -- after the last quarter's earnings, we're not going to break Prolexic out separately. But what I can tell you is what I shared last time is Prolexic's run rate was about $5 million a month. So call it $15 million a quarter, so you have a frame of reference of roughly the size of Prolexic. And relative to the customer ads on the security front, you're right, we were very pleased. This is kind of the first full quarter of having Prolexic and our broader security portfolio. We have not added that many of kind of net new customers in the security portfolio really in -- I don't think ever. So we're quite pleased with that traction, and we expect that the demand for our security portfolio is very strong. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Richard Fetyko, ABR Investment Strategy. Richard Fetyko - ABR Investment Strategy LLC : Just backing into the organic growth rate in the performance and security solutions segment, excluding Prolexic in the first quarter and the second quarter's estimate. It looks like the organic PSS growth slightly decelerated from perhaps 23% in the first to 20% year-over-year in the third. Just curious if we should see any acceleration in the organic business or if there were any specific reasons why that deceleration happened. James Benson : Yes. I mean, I think we had an extraordinarily strong performance in security growth rate in Q1. If you take kind of the 30% growth rate, even if you do the math that you just suggested, you're talking about a 20% rough growth rate for Q2. I mentioned that the custom government business was lighter, so projects in Q2 were lighter. That is in the performance and security portfolio. That's one element of the portfolio that tends to be a little bit lumpier based on projects that you have with the federal government. But we were quite pleased with the growth rates that we saw in performance and security. And there are going to be things, quarter-to-quarter, like custom projects. I recall, last Q2 we had a very strong quarter last Q2. We talked about -- we had a very strong custom government quarter last Q2. And we also talked about the fact that we had a very, very large upgrade of our IP accelerator solution with one particularly large customer. So kind of having the wraparound effect of that. But organically, across kind of the performance and security portfolio, we're quite pleased with the growth rates. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ed Maguire, CLSA. Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division : I was wondering if you could comment on the cross-selling success so far with performance and security and the media business. I know you've mentioned the number of common customers between Prolexic and the Kona Security, but was curious as to how that -- the focus on security is progressing more broadly across the customer base. James Benson : Yes, I mean, I would say -- one proof point is kind of the question I was asked earlier, the kind of the -- call it the net security kind of customers add of over 250, I think tells you that those were sold to the existing installed base. Those were not off the -- most of those were not off the installed base. Most of those were kind of embedded into the installed base. So I think we're doing early signs of traction with Prolexic, we're getting good penetration. I think we're getting decent penetration across the board. I can tell you, though, a lot of room for growth beyond that, that we still have very low penetration rates of kind of security with kind of our broader customer base. So we think this is a huge opportunity to kind of sell more security and sell more of our broader offerings to our customers, as well as off the installed base. So I think there's a lot of opportunity for incremental growth. Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Great. And just a pulse check on the wireless, the Aqua Ion. How are -- how is the penetration proceeding among your existing customers? F. Thomson Leighton : I would say the penetration is small and growing. We see significant uplift in pricing, and there's significant interest, of course, in the product with the situational awareness, the optimization for cellular communication and making the website be really fast for a variety of situations with the end user, a variety of devices and a variety of locations. So Ion is a strong product, financially, with plenty of room for growth. So the overall penetration is still low, as with security, but achieving good success in terms of the upsell and, of course, in terms of the performance capabilities. Operator : Your next question is from the line of James Breen, William Blair. James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Just one more question on the hiring and then one on the technology side. On the hiring side, you hired, I think, about 100 salespeople last year and you'd hinted that you would hire somewhere around that number this year. Is that part of what you're pushing out or has that been pretty consistent throughout the year? And then, secondly, just on the technology side, as you look at the traffic from the World Cup relative to maybe the Sochi Olympics and the London Olympics. Are you seeing any trends there in terms of moving more towards the wireless side relative to wireline and regionally? James Benson : So I'll take the hiring kind of question. So I'd say again, we're not going to provide guidance of how many sales hires. We did that last year, I think, because we were trying to make a point that the company was hiring more sales reps last year, I think, than we had in the last 5 years combined. We're going to hire a similar -- roughly similar amount this year, whether it's 100, whether it's 80 remains to be seen. And it's not so much pushing out hiring. I just want to make sure that I'm clear that we're not pushing out hiring from Q2 to Q3. This was hiring that we had aggressive hiring plans for the first half of the year. Some of that hiring has moved into Q3, but it's not like this conscious push to Q3. And from a sales perspective, that I'd say our sales hiring is tracking pretty well. F. Thomson Leighton : Yes, to the second question. We're seeing across the board a very rapid growth in the penetration of mobile devices. On aggregate, you can think of roughly half of transactions being done with a mobile device now. Now traffic measured by bits is lower, a lower percentage, because when you're doing video and so forth, you'll tend to get lower bit rates to those devices. And most of the wireless device traffic and transactions are on Wi-Fi. So it's not cellular coming out of a tower. Cellular is still a relatively small percentage overall, but also growing. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gray Powell, Wells Fargo Security. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Great. I just had a couple, if I may. So first, I just want to make sure that I'm thinking of Q3 guidance correctly. Specifically, the midpoint of guidance implies $13 million of revenue in Q3, whereas the past 2 years, the guide has been more like 6 or 7 -- I'm sorry, $6 million or $8 million in sequential revenue growth. So I guess, my question is where is the strength coming from? Is it more of the CDN side or performance and security side? James Benson : Again, I'm not going to provide guidance by business, but I can tell you that our expectation is you're going to see strong growth across the entire portfolio. And I think you correctly outlined it that we're pretty bullish, that's why the guidance is pretty strong here at the midpoint. We're expecting a continuation of kind of strong performance in media, strong performance in performance and security and strong performance in service and support. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Got it. Okay. And then just one more, if I may. Can you talk about your partnership with Open DNS on the security side? And how do you feel about the security portfolio today? Do you see an opportunity to add new technologies beyond DDoS and Web Application Firewall? And specifically, can we see Akamai doing something more like cloud-based URL filtering or email security or maybe something else down the road? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes. We have a rich roadmap ahead in security. The next area for us that you'll start to see products is on client reputation database, where we're looking at a particular client and trying to decide are they a legitimate user or is it an attacker of some kind or some kind of a bot, which might be a friendly bot or an unfriendly bot. And providing that information to our customers as a request comes in so that they can decide do they want to accept the request, alert the request or block the request. Even if the request itself doesn't look malicious, maybe that's because it's a new form of attack that hasn't been seen before. Or maybe it's some kind of a bot that they decide that they don't want to admit to the site. So that's the next product that we're working on and that we hope to have a beta version available later this year. And there's a rich roadmap from there that yes we might well be doing things like URL filtering and preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. I don't know about email filtering, that's not coming up anytime soon, that we get into the email business per se. But I think there'll be a very rich roadmap for security, especially as we do more and more with enterprises and their traffic. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Van Rhee, Craig-Hallum. Jeffrey Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : Several quick ones for you. First, just in terms of renewals. While you have big renewals in any given quarter, any notable renewal patterns we should be thinking about the next few quarters? And then second question, as it relates to the landscape around security, could you just touch on the competitive landscape : when you are competing, just clarify for us who is the toe-to-toe typical if you're in there competing against somebody. James Benson : So on the renewal front, I'll let take that, I'll let Tom comment on the security landscape. But I think you kind of answered the question yourself, which is that we have large customers that renew every quarter, and we're going to continue to see large customers renew every quarter. There's nothing more notable in that. Obviously, I shared a few quarters ago one specific customer because they were our largest customer, and they were a customer that was pretty darn close to a 10% revenue customer so -- but I think, outside of that customer, it's just standard renewal that happen every quarter and a handful of large customers. F. Thomson Leighton : In terms of the competitive landscape for the security products, I would say the dominant players out there today where most of the revenue goes are the folks that build devices that you would deploy in your data center. Now the big problem with that as we move forward is that the attacks are so large in many cases that the connectivity at the data center becomes overwhelmed. So even if the device is doing a good job, it never gets a chance really, and then the site is DoS-ed or brought down. Carriers, many of them provide security solutions. Many of them also we sell Akamai. The carriers will try to provide some kind of a clean pipe. And again, you have the capacity challenges. The carrier solutions often are not able to inspect the packets that really limits what they can do. They take a while to be turned on, which can be a problem, they're sort of reactive and slow to react. And they can hurt the performance of the site. So even when they can defend the site, the site is sort of compromised in terms of its ability to do its job performance-wise. I think you're starting to see -- there's a lot of start-ups out there claiming to have various kind of security products. You see the CDNs, some of them trying to have a security offering. I think for the state-of-the-art attacks out there, really, our solution, combined now with Prolexic, provides really something that's special, and that you just can't get other places that really works. And Akamai is a performance company and so we've made sure that when we're defending the site and filtering the traffic, there's not a big performance degradation. The site still is going to work really fast, and it could be on in a proactive manner. We have enormous scale compared to any of the competitors because our servers are inside over 1,200 networks. As we talked about earlier, we'll deliver a World Cup game at 7 terabits a second, and the big attacks out there that overwhelm a lot of the competing services are a tiny fraction of that. So we have tremendous scale to bring to bear to defend websites, and I think that's why you see the business growing so fast with a lot of the marquee brands now turning to Akamai for the next generation of security defenses. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Ben Rose, Battle Road. Ben Z. Rose - Battle Road Research Ltd.: Yes. Question for Tom. Looking out beyond the third quarter, can you provide an update on your ongoing R&D relationship with Cisco and your expectation for the hybrid cloud optimization market? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes, sure. Now, tomorrow, Cisco is making their new router that has what's called Akamai Connect or Akamai software on board generally available. So that hits the marketplace tomorrow. Obviously, we're very interested to see that product become successful in the market. The beta test results are excellent. The product provides significant offload for the WAN and the branch office connectivity. So it allows that infrastructure to do a lot more and it provides significant speedup for branch office applications, Internet access, the basic kinds of things you want to be doing in the branch office. And so, we're very optimistic. That's a product that will be sold by Cisco in the Cisco channel. We're obviously supporting that as best we can, but that's a Cisco-led effort with Akamai software on board. There is a rich roadmap beyond that first product to do more, and we have a very good relationship with Cisco in R&D and are looking forward to the release tomorrow. Ben Z. Rose - Battle Road Research Ltd.: Okay, great. And then a question for Jim. I know the company has obviously done a really outstanding job over the last several quarters of wringing out some of the inefficiencies in the network and improving gross margins. Do you think that there's further room, going forward, to achieve the kinds of efficiencies that you've achieved in the last year? James Benson : I mean -- I think we do it every quarter, we do it every year. You're right. Notably, over the last 3 years, it's been a pretty impressive improvement in gross margins for the company. And I have to kind of really give the credit to our network and media team, they've just done a fantastic job, and you can expect that we're going to continue to have ongoing platform efficiency initiatives that can kind of maintain the level of gross margins that we have. I'm not calling, obviously, in the guidance that it's going to improve, but I think we can maintain the margins at the levels that we're currently at. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Philip Winslow, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil Winslow. So one more question on the gross margin side. Could you give us some color on like what you are seeing in terms of co-location and bandwidth costs? And maybe what you have seen through first half and what do you expect in the second half? James Benson : Yes. Again, we continue to make progress on driving kind of the bandwidth per kind of megabit per second down. So our bandwidth costs continue to trend down nicely, not on an actual dollar basis, but kind of on a per-bit basis. And the same is true for co-location costs. So we have a whole playbook that is focused on areas that are going to be able to reduce bandwidth costs. Areas that can help us reduce co-location costs, areas that can help us build kind of reduced costs and optimized costs associated with kind of network broader buildout. So you can expect that we're going to continue to kind of initiate all those initiatives, not just this quarter, but the second half of the year and beyond. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kevin Smithen, Macquarie. Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research : First of all, nice job with the guidance, especially with the customer repricing and all the investments. Wanted to ask you, as we see more high-def and 4K sporting events and online gaming more pervasive -- online content more pervasive, do you think that we're going to see a new normal in terms of growth rates for the media business over the next couple of years? And how do you sort of think about the trade-off with some of the large media customers between sort of these -- this extra traffic and margins? And do you continue to expect to give volume discounts to those big customers or will you try and diversify the customer base more than, say, 2 to 3 years ago? F. Thomson Leighton : Obviously, as -- if and when 4K becomes more widespread, that provides dramatic increase in traffic for every hour of video that's watched online. 4K has obviously not penetrated the market yet. We do support it on our platform, but it's not widely adopted. Traffic is growing at a rapid rate. There is the potential over a period of several to many years for several orders of magnitude of growth in the online traffic. Of course, pricing is going to need to come down, and we've talked in the past about the many things we're doing to make video be more affordable online. But on balance, when you multiply the traffic growth rates with the price reductions, we believe that revenues have a lot of room for growth going forward. And we're very bullish about our media business, as I've talked about before. Of course, as customers get larger and push more traffic, they do get traffic discounts, but that's already factored into our estimates as we look forward. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Dixon, FBR Capital Markets. David Michael Dixon - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Yes. So I wondered if, first of all, you could just give us a general sense of the momentum that you're seeing, or to the extent you're seeing momentum in the mobile space, which is a key area of growth for you? And then, secondly, as you were talking about your advantages in the marketplace and you centered in on the scalability of the platform. One of the other things that I think seems to be an advantage is the customer responsiveness relative to the telcos. And in talking to some the major enterprises that we speak who checks the -- they don't really care if it's in the cloud or in their own enterprise, as long as that stack can be evaluated for attacks and analysis. So I wanted to actually ask you a question around the network compute capability and whether you see the need to overhaul or significantly augment that compute capability as you see Google stepping forth and investing very aggressively, very heavily in, perhaps, hundreds of data centers here with that compute capability. F. Thomson Leighton : Sure. First on the mobile question, as I mentioned before, we're seeing a rapid penetration of mobile devices that if you measure in terms of applications that we would transact, roughly half being on a mobile device. Now the large majority of that is on Wi-Fi so, ultimately, it's going across a landline connection. Still, a small fraction of mobile is over cellular. And also, if you measure not by transactions but by gigabytes delivered, mobile will have a lower penetration because you don't tend to get the really high-def video that takes a lot of traffic going to a mobile device that's -- usually you're going to send that to a much larger screen that's a fixed device. Yes, we do have tremendous advantages and scalability, but also in sophistication and capability of our defenses. Now in terms of the question on network compute, we do offer compute kinds of capabilities in the specific use case of your website and something that needs to be done for the website. So for example, say, you're an automotive site and you want to do a car configurator so that the user can design their car online, well that kind of thing can be supported by Akamai's platform. I don't think you're going to see us go into direct competition with EC2 or with Google in terms of building out gigantic data centers just for compute capabilities -- for generic compute capability. We are focused around making a website and a web app be fast, reliable and secure. And so we will offer capabilities that support that in terms of storage or compute and delivery, not generic compute for the sake of compute. David Michael Dixon - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : You're not seeing any competition from Google or signs of competition in the area that you're focused at this stage? F. Thomson Leighton : No. I wouldn't say that we see competition from Google. Google does a lot of delivering of content, of course, and they do a lot of that themselves, but that's not really directly competitive to Akamai. We worry about all of the large guys out there in terms of what their capabilities are, but we don't really see them in the marketplace competing for our business. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Chad Bartley, Pacific Crest. Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division : Wanted to go back to the competition topic. As you look out medium to longer term, how much of a threat are networks either launching competitive CDN services or maybe large media companies connecting directly to them? And in terms of the outlook, I mean, based on your previous second half EBITDA margin guidance and your updated Q3 outlook, should we be thinking about Q4 EBITDA margin also in the 41% to 42% range? F. Thomson Leighton : All right. Let me take the first question on competition. And again, the competition really depends on the product area. It's different for video delivery or media delivery than it is from making a web application be super fast for mobile, and that's different than the competition for security. Now in terms of your specific questions about networks as competitors, I'd say there's been a lot of improvement there over the last few years. For example, AT&T used to be a large competitor for Akamai. And now, they're one of our largest partners. Orange in France, Telefonica in Spain, KT in Korea, Swisscom, Turk Telecom, a lot of the world's leading carriers have switched from a model of competing with us, either by buying CDN capabilities from a vendor or developing it themselves, to using Akamai's technology. So they're part of the Akamai family and they integrate very well with us and resell our products. So I'd say that, yes, there's some carriers out there that compete with us, for sure, but that I would say the trend is more that they are moving to work cooperatively with Akamai. And that's because I think we offer the most compelling solutions when it comes to making a website or an app be fast, reliable and secure. And we can do that at a better cost and a better performance than they've been able to do on their own. It is certainly true that any large media company, to your other -- your point, will be looking at do-it-yourself. I think we've said probably for 15 years now, that do-it-yourself is our largest competitor, and you can certainly find examples of that. That said, a lot of the folks that do that still use us for a lot of their business, and they do that again because we do really a very good job of accelerating their content and defending their websites at a very good price point. And there's some pretty high-profile examples of major media companies that did try to build it themselves, spent years doing it and ultimately gave up and returned to Akamai. So I think do-it-yourself is always going to be a factor in the marketplace for us with the very largest media companies. I don't think direct peering makes sense or you'll actually see that for any but a very small number, maybe a handful of the big media guys. The complexity of trying to manage direct peering with 12 dozens or hundreds or thousands of the ISPs out there is really complicated, and the expense in doing that is quite significant. And so it just doesn't make sense to even be tried for any but a handful of the big media guys. So that really doesn't worry me very much. James Benson : And on the EBITDA question. I'm not going to provide guidance obviously beyond Q3, but I think I said kind of in my opening comments that we expect to operate in the near term in the low-40s EBITDA. So I think you kind of have what we're expecting to do in Q3 and I think you can expect that we're going to continue to operate kind of in that range, kind of in the near term. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Tom Barth for any closing remarks. Tom Barth : Okay. We'd just like to thank you again for joining us today on the earnings call. We would look forward to speaking to you further about our performance and our future opportunities. So please feel free to call us, and have a wonderful summer. Thank you. F. Thomson Leighton : Thank you. James Benson : Thank you. Operator : Gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We thank you for participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Riley Caris, Research Division Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division David Michael Dixon - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Akamai Technologies Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jasmine, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Tom Barth : Thank you, Jasmine, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on October 29, 2014. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom. F. Thomson Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Q3 was another excellent quarter for Akamai, with revenues and earning both exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Revenue in the third quarter was a record $498 million. That's up 26% over Q3 of 2013. Our strong financial results continue to be driven by solid performance across all of our geographies and all of our major product lines, with significant growth coming from our security and media products. Our overachievement on the top line was led by better-than-expected traffic and revenue growth from our Media Delivery solutions. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.62 per diluted share, a 24% increase year-over-year. Our overachievement on the bottom line was driven by higher-than-expected revenue, continued strong operational execution and a favorable change in our tax rate. The tax rate change had a $0.02 benefit on non-GAAP EPS that was not included in the guidance that we provided you last quarter. I'll be back in a few minutes to talk more about our achievements in the third quarter. But first, let me turn the call over to Jim to review our Q3 financial results in detail and to provide the outlook for Q4. Jim? James Benson : Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Akamai continues to execute well and had a great third quarter. As Tom outlined, Q3 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $498 million, up 26% year-over-year and up 5% or $22 million sequentially. This result marks our first quarter of year-over-year growth of over $100 million and represents our highest Q2 to Q3 sequential growth ever. Revenue growth was solid across the entire business, but the overachievement compared to our guidance was driven by unseasonably strong traffic and revenue growth in our Media Delivery solutions. Media revenue was $231 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. These growth rates are particularly impressive when you consider the summer months are historically lighter for Internet use. Traffic and revenue growth accelerated across most of the customer base, with particularly strong growth coming from our largest and most strategic social media, gaming and video delivery customers. We are very pleased with the performance of the media business and remain bullish on the secular trends for this business looking forward. At the same time, we recognize that the drivers of this business, namely traffic volumes and price, can lead to revenue variability from one quarter to the next, given the nature, timing and size of gaming and software releases as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities. Turning now to our performance in security solutions. Revenue was $224 million in the quarter, up 29% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially, with balanced growth across all of our geographies. We are especially pleased with this 29% increase compared to last year's very strong Q3 that was aided by a couple nonrecurring engagements, most notably, the completion of a large custom government project. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth in our Web performance solutions. And as Tom mentioned, we continue to see very strong growth in demand in our cloud security solutions. Finally, revenue from our services and support solutions was $43 million in the quarter, up 32% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. New customer attachment rates for our enterprise-class professional services and customer support continued to be healthy during the quarter. Switching now to our geographies. Revenue growth continued to be well-balanced across all 3 major geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 27% of total revenue in Q3, consistent with Q3 of 2013, and down 1 point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $135 million in the quarter, up 28% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Currency fluctuations had a modest benefit on revenue on a year-over-year basis, but had a $2 million negative impact on a sequential basis as the dollar strengthened sharply late in the quarter. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, international revenue grew 27% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. We continue to see solid traction in our Asia Pacific geography and improved performance in our EMEA markets, primarily driven by strength in our Media Delivery business. Revenue from our U.S. market was $363 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially, with particularly strong growth in our large social media, gaming and video delivery customer base. And finally, revenue through channel partners represented 25% of total revenue in Q3, consistent with the prior quarter and up 4 points from the prior year. This year-over-year increase is consistent with first half levels and driven by traction with our carrier partners in particular as well as contributions from Prolexic's channel relationships. Moving onto costs. As expected, cash gross margin was 78%, up 2 points from the same period last year and consistent with the prior quarter as we continue to execute well against our platform efficiency initiatives. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 68%, up 1 point from the same period last year, down 1 point from the prior quarter and in line with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $219 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $177 million, up $11 million from Q2 levels, and at the lower end of our guidance range, primarily due to less hiring than expected in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $213 million, up $40 million from the same period last year and up $9 million from Q2 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 43%, down 1 point from the same period last year and consistent with Q2 levels. This result was slightly above the high end of our guidance range for the quarter, driven by a combination of revenue overachievement and operating expenses coming in at the lower end of guidance that I just mentioned. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $67 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $55 million, up $7 million from Q2 levels and slightly above our expectations due to the release of several large internal-use software projects to our network. As a reminder, in Q2, we introduced an additional financial metric, non-GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP operating income is essentially adjusted EBITDA less non-GAAP depreciation expense. This is an operational measure we review internally and believe it is a useful supplemental metric for investors since it captures the depreciation related to our day-to-day operations that the adjusted EBITDA metric does not. And this metric is not impacted by taxes, which can move around quarterly for nonoperational reasons. This is also a very common metric that many of our peers provide. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $158 million, up $25 million from the same period last year and up $2 million from Q2 levels. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 32%, down 1 point from both the same period last year and from Q2 levels and at the high end of the guidance range that we provided. Moving onto the other income and expense items. Interest income for the third quarter was roughly $2 million, up slightly from Q2 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $4 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $91 million or $0.50 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $111 million or $0.62 of earnings per diluted share and coming in $0.04 higher than the high end of our guidance range. As Tom mentioned earlier, we had a discrete tax item this quarter that was not included in our guidance and positively impacted non-GAAP net income by $4 million or $0.02 of earnings per diluted share. Excluding this benefit, our non-GAAP earnings would have been $0.60 per diluted share, coming in $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range, driven by the strong revenue performance and slightly lower-than-expected operating expenses mentioned earlier. Given the significant impact of this tax benefit to our Q3 net income, let me provide you with some color about it. This item pertains to the retroactive adoption of a state income tax benefit associated with our software development activities. You may recall a similar tax benefit we were able to take last year related to our federal taxes. While many high-tech companies are able to take advantage of these federal and state benefits, the timing and amount of the benefit reflect an evolving adoption practice in the software industry. As part of adopting this tax benefit in Q3, the accounting rules require a onetime retroactive true-up in the quarter. Third quarter GAAP net income was positively impacted by $16 million or $0.09 per diluted share from this tax benefit. And as I just said, non-GAAP net income was positively impacted by $4 million or $0.02 per diluted share. The net effect of this adoption resulted in Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates of 22% and 30%, respectively. On a go-forward basis, we expect a tax benefit of approximately 1 point on our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 181 million shares, consistent with Q2 levels and in line with our guidance. Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Day sales outstanding for the third quarter was 60 days, unchanged from last quarter and up 3 days from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, was $79 million, considerably below our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to the timing of network build-outs that moved into Q4. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities. Cash flow generation continue to be strong in the third quarter. Cash from operations was $173 million in the quarter and $463 million year-to-date. Free cash flow, which includes CapEx spending, was $102 million in the quarter or 20% of revenue. During the quarter, we spent approximately $39 million on share repurchases, buying back approximately 600,000 shares at an average price of $60. As of Q3 end, we had $476 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $900 million. As we've discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times. As always, our overall goal is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our shareholders in a manner we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. In summary, we are very pleased with how the business performed in Q3 and year-to-date. We continue to execute well, delivered strong revenue growth, managed network cost effectively and made the necessary investments in the business that we believe will build a foundation for sustained long-term growth. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. Holiday seasonality plays a large role in our performance, driven by online retail traffic for our e-commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. As a result, it is the quarter that is most impacted by the external macroeconomic environment, which remains hard to predict. In addition, we expect significant foreign exchange headwinds from the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. At current spot rates, foreign exchange is expected to have a negative impact of roughly $6 million compared to Q3 and $8 million compared to Q4 of last year. Lastly, Q3 was a very strong revenue quarter that exceeded our expectations, in our media business specifically. And as I discussed earlier, our Q3 revenue benefited from unseasonably strong media traffic and revenue growth, which may translate into a slightly more moderate Q3 to Q4 growth rate than what we've historically seen. Factoring in all these points, we are expecting another strong quarter with Q4 revenue in the range of $515 million to $535 million. This range represents 20% to 25% growth adjusted for foreign exchange movements over a very strong fourth quarter last year. To frame the guidance range, if the holiday season is strong, we would expect to be near the higher end of the revenue range. If the holiday season is weak, then we would expect to be towards the lower end of the range. At these revenue levels, we expect gross margins to increase slightly from Q3 levels, consistent with seasonal patterns, with cash gross margins of 79% and GAAP gross margins of 69%. On the operating expense side, we expect to grow non-GAAP cash operating expenses by $9 million to $14 million on a sequential basis, reflecting incremental Q4 hiring and related infrastructure spend as well as typical year-end expense items. Year-to-date, we have added approximately 950 employees across the company, with these additions focused primarily in sales, supporting go-to-market capacity, service and customer support staffing and engineering resources. We expect to continue hiring in these areas in Q4 as well. Factoring in all these items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of 42% to 43%. Whether we land at the high end or low end of this EBITDA range will be heavily dependent on revenue performance. And as I have been messaging in prior calls, looking beyond Q4, we are planning to operate the company in the low 40 EBITDA range as we continue to ramp up the necessary investments that we expect will help drive Akamai's growth and scale beyond 2014. Moving onto depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $56 million to $57 million, up slightly from Q3 levels. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 32% to 33% for Q4. And with this -- and with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.61 to $0.66. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $52 million to $57 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 32%. This guidance does not include any benefit from the federal R&D tax credit which we do not expect to be reinstated by year-end. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of roughly 181 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $90 million to $95 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. These levels are higher than what we have spent in the recent quarters due primarily to network deployments that shifted from Q3 to Q4. For the full year 2014, this implies CapEx as a percent of revenue to be slightly above our long-term model, consistent with what I've shared on prior calls. In closing, we delivered an exceptional Q3 after a very successful first half of 2014, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. Now let me turn the call back over to Tom. F. Thomson Leighton : Thanks, Jim. Today marks a special anniversary for Akamai. 15 years ago, on October 29, 1999, Akamai began trading as a public company. At the time of our IPO, we had 350 employees, 50 network partners and 1,400 servers in 20 countries, delivering peak traffic of 1 gigabit per second for a total of 100 customers. In the fourth quarter of 1999, we generated less than $3 million of revenue and a substantial net loss. Today, Akamai has nearly 5,000 employees, 1,300 network partners and over 150,000 servers in 95 countries, supporting peak traffic of more than 26 terabits per second for 5,000 customers worldwide. And in the third quarter, we delivered nearly $0.5 billion of revenue. Unlike many other Internet companies, Akamai is highly profitable. We have grown profits every year over the past decade and we generated nearly $100 million of GAAP net income in the third quarter. There is no doubt that Akamai has come a long way over the past 15 years, and so has the Internet. The global population of Internet users has multiplied more than tenfold from 280 million, which was less than 5% of the world population in 1999, to nearly 3 billion people today. And the number of websites has grown from about 3 million to over 1 billion. The annual e-commerce volume has grown from less than $100 billion in 1999 to a projected $1.5 trillion this year. The number of mobile devices in the world has increased from 750 million to an estimated 8 billion. The accelerating growth of online usage and cloud services is placing significant stress on an Internet infrastructure that was not designed to accommodate the rapidly growing demands for scale, speed, reliability and security. As a result, congestion is increasing at major peering points, which degrades video quality and slows down Web applications. Performance is also hampered by the increasing complexity of Web applications. In the past 2 years, the typical size of a Web page has more than doubled. The number of third-party domains on a typical page is up 56%, and the average amount of JavaScript on a page has grown by 40%. The net result is that the average time to download a Web page from an origin has increased by more than 60% in just 2 years. At the same time, user expectations are that websites and apps should be faster, not slower, especially for the latest mobile devices. Making matters even worse, cybersecurity attacks on major websites are increasing in terms of their size, their frequency and their sophistication. We are now seeing attacks with many tens of gigabits per second of traffic on a daily basis, and some attacks generate hundreds of gigabits per second of traffic, far exceeding what the vast majority of websites can handle using traditional defenses. Given these trends, it's no surprise that Akamai's services are in such great demand and why Akamai remains focused on solving 4 grand challenges for our customers : Delivering the highest quality Internet video at large scale and low cost; making websites and apps be fast on any device, anywhere, even in congested cellular networks; protecting websites and data centers from cyberattacks that aim to disrupt online operations or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks so they can handle new cloud workloads with speed and affordability. We discussed these grand challenges at our Seventh Annual Customer Conference in Miami earlier this month. The feedback that we received from the nearly 1,600 attendees from 39 countries reinforced our belief that we are focused on solving the right problems and that we have a robust portfolio of products to help them deliver their content to a large global audience to improve their site performance, to secure their online operations and to optimize their enterprise networks. Media customers at the conference indicated that they expect much more high-quality video content to move online during the next several years. Not only is more media viewing shifting online, but the emerging formats, such as 4K or Ultra-HD, require much higher bit rates to satisfy the increasing user demand for quality. Already, we have several customers distributing video at rates near 10 megabits per second, which is about a factor of 3 higher than what was recently the norm. The potential for explosive growth in online video traffic presents us with substantial opportunities. It is the reason why we are continuing to invest in media technology innovation and network build-out. Delivering high-quality video at scale is much more complicated than most people realize. And despite our many competitors and the do-it-yourself efforts by large content owners and service providers, Akamai is differentiated by our success in streaming high-quality video at scale through our unique platform of servers in thousands of locations close to end users. Our tremendous scale is achieved in part through close cooperation with the many networks that comprise the Internet. We locate our servers inside nearly 1,300 networks, and we are forming much deeper relationships with the world's largest carriers. Recently, we were very pleased to announce new strategic partnerships with SingTel and China Telecom, which we expect will further expand our capabilities and capacity in the Asia Pacific region for both local and global customers. Not surprisingly, security was a top concern for customers across all verticals of the customer conference as cyberattacks continued to increase in size and sophistication. Many customers toured our security operations center in Fort Lauderdale where they could see how Akamai's Security Solutions leverage our massively distributed platform as an outer layer of defense while preserving site performance and availability. This high level of interest and engagement by our customers is an indication of why security has continued to be our fastest-growing product category. At the end of the third quarter, over 1,600 customers were using our security products, with more than 850 having purchased one or both of our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Routed Solutions. During the conference, we also launched our new high-end performance offerings, Ion Standard and Ion Premier. These products are significantly faster and easier to use than our very popular Dynamic Site Accelerator service known as DSA. And they incorporate a wide range of innovative technologies for improving mobile and cellular performance. In fact, data from real end users shows that Ion Premier can cut download times in half when compared to DSA for cellular networks. This is especially impressive given that DSA is already faster than the solutions being offered by the competition. We are currently working on further innovations to the Ion product line with the ultimate goal of providing near-instant response time no matter where users are, what device or browser they are using or how they are connected to the Internet. In summary, we've had an excellent first 9 months of the year and we believe that our solid financial performance demonstrates the soundness and sustainability of our business strategy. As we celebrate 15 years as a public company, we believe that our continued investments in product innovation, sales capacity and platform capabilities are expanding the foundation for our future growth. Thank you for your time today. Now Jim and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you -- the fragmented competition as well as the DIY approach, I specifically want to go into that DIY, which we've talked about a number of times through the years. There was a lot of talk about it in the quarter with a notable customer, and what maybe they did or did not deliver themselves. What would you say, among your top customers, is their thoughts around DIY and how does that impact your business with Akamai? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes. As we've been saying for close to 15 years, DIY is our biggest competitor. The very biggest media companies, pretty much all of them have had a DIY effort, and I think that's going to continue to be the case in the future. Our job is to invest in research and development and figure out how to do it better at greater scale and at lower cost. And I think, we've had a really good track record of doing that. And so we're always competing with the very biggest customers' DIY efforts, and I think, we'll continue to be successful in that regard. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then, a follow-up would be, on the media strength that you saw, you mentioned a number of factors that should drive the longer-term growth, whether it's 4K content, et cetera. How do we match that versus things that may drive seasonality, whether it be a software update or social media video or things of that nature that may cause lumpiness? How do we think about those 2 things and how we should be expecting the growth in that segment of the business to trend going forward? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes. I think, the trends are pretty clear. Traffic is growing, has always grown at substantial rates. I think, there's good reason to believe that it will grow at substantial rates in the future. For Media Delivery, pricing per bit comes down as we find ways to lower cost and make it be more efficient. You take the product to those 2 and that gives you revenue, which has increased at pretty reasonable rates for Akamai over the years. There always will be some lumpiness, as you mentioned, a big software download, a big media event. No one event really dramatically swings revenue, but things can happen. There could be repricing events for a large customer. Traffic can rise and traffic can wane. And I think, the key is not to be distracted by the lumpiness. That's always going to be there. The key is to look at the long-range trends, what kind of traffic might move online, and there's tremendous potential for traffic growth, as you think about more video coming online and having it come online in higher quality, which means more bits per second and more hours of watching online. And I think that can lead to a model that shows traffic growing substantially. We're working to take the cost out to be able to lower cost so that could be affordable for our customers and generate good revenue and profits for Akamai. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I had two actually. I wanted to focus on the performance in the Security Solutions segment. I mean, the upside of the last few quarters, it seems like the vast majority is going -- coming from the Media Delivery side. But in this business, where I know you guys are very optimistic, can you walk us through who you see yourself competing with most often in RFPs? And when push comes to shove, what is the reason why Akamai is winning? And are you doing that with other partners when you go in there so you're part of a bundled solution? And then, I was just wondering if you could update us on the Prolexic contribution? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes, sure. Let me talk about the competition and the partners, and then, Jim will talk about the breakout on Prolexic. The competition depends on the needs of the customer and the product that we're talking about. In security, we're competing primarily with the traditional way of doing things, which would be to buy a box and stick it in your data center, and the goal of the box is to filter out the bad traffic. And the challenge with that approach is that you can't handle the capacity anymore. Just the attacking entities have so much more capability to generate traffic than you can allocate infrastructure to defend yourself with. And that's where Akamai comes in because we have, relatively speaking, an enormous platform and a tremendous ability to absorb that traffic as an outer layer of defense for the data center. So we are competing with the traditional security vendors primarily, and the good news is that the world is moving to a point where you really need Akamai to be able to defend yourself against the large attacks. In the performance category, we compete with a lot of folks. Pretty much all the CDNs will have a product that they say is a performance product, and the goal there is to be a lot faster than the competition. And in all the case studies that we have, working with customers, show that we are. We're paying a lot of attention to the mobile environment and to the cellular environment where performance is particularly challenged, and those environments are a lot more important as more transactions move to mobile devices and over cellular networks. And the new Ion products have great performance there, and they really just perform a whole lot better than the competitor. And of course, reliability, you've got to have many 9s of reliability if you're handling commerce and transactions, and that's another great way we distinguish ourselves against the competition. As you know, the majority of our sales are direct today, but we are growing our channel and partner relationships, and especially our carrier partner relationships. And that is an important part of our growth in the future. And in some cases, we do have products sold through them under their brand name where we're providing the capability behind the scenes. And let me turn it over to Jim now about the Prolexic revenue question. James Benson : Sure. So I think, as we shared with you, that we're not -- we don't separately disclose security as a segment. We do it -- we'll share that annually with you at our Investor Summit. So when we acquired Prolexic, I think we told you, they were operating at about a $5 million a month run rate. As Tom said, the security portfolio in aggregate is by far our fastest-growing product category. We'll share, obviously, all these kind of the details on a quarterly basis. I think it was worth you commenting that it's true that Media Delivery solutions was really the driver of the overachievement, but we don't want to lose sight of the fact that the performance in the security segment grew 29% year-over-year off of a very strong Q3 of last year. So we're very pleased with the growth, not only in security, but also across all the product lines within that solution category. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie. Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research : Despite your really strong growth this year, your multiples actually dropped pretty significantly in the last few quarters, and I noticed your share repurchase amount has slowed in the aggregate a lot since Q1. With the stock trading down here, would you consider stepping up the share repurchase meaningfully, actually shrink the shares, as opposed to just offsetting option dilution, or you're saving your cash for deals in security over the next couple of quarters? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes. That's a great question. I think that -- I think, as we shared with you in the past, that certainly, we're looking at our cash and trying to be responsible and balanced about it. First and foremost, making sure that we can invest in the business with it. I think, secondarily, we are very active in looking at opportunities in the M&A space, and so we want to make sure that we can pull the trigger on that. But you're right that kind of a third area is to make sure that we're at a minimum buying back shares to offset dilution from employee equity grants. And the way our program is structured is we will step up purchasing based on varying stock prices. So if the stock price is lower, you'll see us kind of step it up. Obviously, the stock price was around $60, call it, roughly in Q3 and we bought back a little less in Q3, but you might -- without telling you exactly what we're going to buy back, we just look at it in a very balanced way, and based on kind of all those factors, you can expect that we may increase the share repurchase activity. Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research : And just on the M&A front, has there been any change in recent weeks on sort of private market valuation expectations here? Or are we still sort of at very high levels? Have you seen any sort of reset to private equity views on IPO access, et cetera? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes. I mean, you probably know as much as I do in that space that I think the reality is it depends upon the sectors, certainly in the security business, that the valuation is still very, very high. I think, it depends upon the area. We're not just looking in any one particular area. We're looking across the portfolio and potentially adjacency areas, and so valuation varies based on kind of the technology in the area. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair. James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Just around the media business, and then, with respect to the World Cup, obviously, we saw a lot of traffic spikes during that time period, the end of June into July. How does that follow across revenue with respect to international versus domestic? And then, is that a big factor in the media segment this quarter? F. Thomson Leighton : No. Actually, you are right, though, that the World Cup straddled both Q2 and Q3. So as Tom mentioned as an opener, that these events, while they contribute -- they do contribute revenue to us, they're more a kind of a showcase of the capability of what is possible for serving live events on the Internet. And so you can expect that we saw revenue for the World Cup in Q2. We saw revenue in the World Cup in Q3. That was not the driver of kind of the media acceleration. Really, the driver of the media acceleration is we had very, very strong growth in revenue, in social media in particular, and we had very strong growth in the gaming sector, and we had very strong growth in the video delivery space. So those were 3 areas that traffic and revenue growth exceeded our expectations. James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : And then, just a second question. You discussed recently your relationship with China Telecom. Can you just talk about what that gives you in terms of capabilities, given the growth there on the smartphone side? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes. That gives us an important partner in China. It gives us better deployment. We're delivering traffic now in China through that partnership. And obviously, China Telecom is an important player in China, and so we want to be partnered with the world's leading carriers, and that was a significant step forward for us. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. James Wesman : It's James Wesman sitting in for Michael. First question, looking to 4Q, are there any greater-than-normal amounts of significant contracts you guys are expecting for renewal? F. Thomson Leighton : No. I mean, I think, as we've shared with you in the past, that every quarter, we have kind of customers that are coming up for renewal. We had them in Q3. We're going to have them in Q4, but nothing kind of notable. James Wesman : All right. And then, just a follow-up. I know, Jim, you talked about that your OpEx came in at the lower end of your guide for Q3. You hired a little bit below where you guys were expecting them. Any color on why you guys think you were off target there? James Benson : I think, we're very aggressive in our hiring expectations. I can tell you that we have a pretty large recruiting organization really actively trying to hire on the sales ranks and in the technical ranks, in particular, as well as services. And I think that we're just -- when you have very aggressive expectation, we became a little bit short of that. Obviously, in our guidance range, we gave you a high and a low, so we were within the range, we were just a little bit on the lower end because it was a little bit lighter than we thought. And you'll see us pick up on some of that hiring in Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Two questions. On the media acceleration side, do you think these trends are secular? Or was there any kind of one time items in the quarter? And I noticed just on that, you didn't really mention software as an impact on the quarter. Maybe just something in there. And then, secondly, it sounds like the performance improvements for Ion are pretty phenomenal. Are you able to kind of price up the products much at this point? Are you seeing much resistance to that? James Benson : Yes. So on the media side, really, it wasn't -- I would not say there was anything one time. I just -- as I mentioned, I'll reiterate it again, that we just had really strong profit growth across those areas that I mentioned of kind of the video delivery space, the social media space and the gaming space. Those areas are very, very hot right now. For some of the reasons that Tom mentioned, as more content moves online, video delivery is growing. As gaming goes more online versus kind of buying it via a disk, you're starting to see acceleration there, and the same in the social media space. So nothing kind of -- those are more secular trends. As we told you in the past, software, and you could call gaming a software download as well, we've distinguished between kind of, call it, your more traditional software downloads from gaming. We had a good software download quarter. It just wasn't a notable driver of our overachievement. So nothing notable as far as one time, but as I said, that it was kind of unseasonably strong traffic growth, and I know you didn't quite ask the question about the Q4 guidance, but as I mentioned in my remarks, that I think because it was so strong in Q3, we have a range in our guidance that really reflects maybe perhaps the Q3, Q4 growth rates we usually see historically may not be as strong just because of how strong Q3 was. But at the high end of our range, it would suggest that it is. So that's kind of why we guided like we did. So Ion performance, I mean, Tom, you can probably cover a little bit more on the performance side, but we've certainly seen that there is a pricing uplift that you can garner with customers based on performance, and so we have seen that. F. Thomson Leighton : Yes, the performance is really important to customers. It increases their revenue, it improves their brand. They need to have it. It's really hard to achieve in environments like mobile and cellular, and we've done a lot of investment into innovation there to make it a lot faster. And so we do see upsell there, and the customer is interested in that. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Will Power with Robert Baird. William V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I guess, a couple of quick questions. So as you think about the tougher sequential compare from Q3 to Q4, there's certainly been a lot of rumors in the marketplace about your -- one of your largest customers and the largest customer potentially in-sourcing. And so I guess, I'm trying to understand, to the degree that may have had or may be having any impact as to how you think about Q4, if you can maybe comment on that? Then I have a second question. F. Thomson Leighton : Yes, I mean, I can't specifically talk about any one particular customer. I can tell you that no one customer is a notable change from Q3 to Q4, and that is not really a driver of why something is maybe going to be less than it's been historically. So without talking about a specific customer, I can tell you that there's nothing notable in our guidance that suggests that there's a change in any one customer. William V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. Then, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the CDN competitive climate generally, whether it's level 3 Amazon, all the variety of customers that are out there. Have you seen much of a change from a pricing dynamic or anything else in the marketplace? F. Thomson Leighton : I think, the CDN competitive climate has been challenging for the last 15 years and will continue to be so. There's a lot of competitors, and we work very hard to do a better job of it, be more reliable, higher scale, better performance, better video quality and to be affordable for our customers. And I think we've had a lot of success. If there's been a change per se, I would say that our success in working with the major carriers has been a helpful change. Many of the carriers were competing with Akamai, and you're seeing in the last year to 2 years, several of the big carriers now converting to the Akamai platform, and working together with us. And I think, that's been a fundamental shift that's been helpful to us, but there's a lot of competitors out there. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great. I was going to ask you about your sales. I mean, could you just remind us when you started accelerating hiring of sales? And given that, I think, you said it takes about 5 quarters to really be productive. What percentage of your hires are now productive? And is that contributing to the revenue growth that you're seeing? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes. We began in the kind of the back half of 2012, stepping up the investment in the sales force, and it's ramped since then, obviously, through 2013. And a similar level of kind of hiring here in 2014. And you're right, it takes about kind of 5 quarters for a rep to kind of become fully productive. And we certainly see reps ramping kind of from first quarter to fifth quarter. I think, what we found that maybe -- we were initially thinking that -- I think, what we had shared was we would see the reps focused more on the performance and security space. And I think, what we found is some of our media performance has been driven by some of this rep productivity, that we've had some nice customer wins with some of the reps that we've added. So I think the reps are producing well. And of course, they're contributing to the growth that we've seen. We're -- we grew the performance and security business 29%. We grew it 30% in Q2. We grew the media business 22% this quarter. So certainly, the reps are really the kind of the key driver of that. Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And then, I wanted to ask on security side. It looks like you ticked off a couple of things during the quarter, talking about some Linux bugs and so forth. Are those important? Are people noticing you because you're catching things out there? And could you also clarify for us how much is on-prem and off-prem because I thought Prolexic had a fair amount of on-prem security software. F. Thomson Leighton : No. Primarily, the security software from Prolexic is off-premise. It's in the scrubbing centers that we are now expanding and growing on a more global basis. The attacks that you probably read about in the headlines, I'm -- there could be attacks on customer sites, which we defend, and have had a very successful track record there. There's also been some headlines about vulnerabilities in core software, things like SSL V3, Bash, Open SSL, the kinds of things that a lot of people use that suddenly the world discovers have backdoors or ways in to compromise the software. And we have been taking a leadership role in talking about that. A lot of the companies don't like to talk about security vulnerabilities, and we've open-sourced our patches for some of those vulnerabilities, and really just taking a leadership role in the community to acknowledge what's going on to try to educate people what they need to do and give them advice on what -- here's how we think you should be able to defend against or fix this kind of a problem. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Following on that sales headcount question. Specifically, are still on a run rate to add around 100 salespeople this year? Or have you changed any plans there? And should we expect the new adds will be a lot lower next year? In other words, will you have kind of hit a number by the end of this year that feels right? James Benson : Yes. We didn't specifically provide a number for this year. We simply hired kind of roughly at similar amount to what we did last year. So I mean, you're in the zone of roughly what we're going to hire for sales reps. And I'm really not going to comment about what we're going to do next year, but you can expect that the investments that I mentioned, we will continue make investments in the sales organization. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : All right. And then, on security, you mentioned more than 1,600 security customers at the end of Q3. And I think, the monthly ARPU was around $7,000 last quarter in Q2. Is there anything you can say about what you're expecting that 1,600 number to go to as far as customers in 2015? And then, could you tell us what ARPU was in Q3 and maybe also where you think that may be trending? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes. I'm not going to comment on the ARPU specifically. I will share that at the Investor Summit that we have coming up, but I can tell you that, certainly, there is huge demand for our security offerings. And we have roughly kind of, call it, 5,500 customers today. Those security offerings are relevant to all those customers. And there are customers that we don't have today that we're going after that are relevant in the security space. So I think, there's a huge opportunity for security. As you know, it takes a while to get penetration in that space. Acquiring Prolexic was a huge benefit because we immediately -- not only technology, but capability from a people perspective and a sales perspective. It's a different kind of a -- it's a different way of selling than our historical reps have sold on the performance side, and it takes a while to get comfortable in doing that, but we expect to see continued traction and penetration of selling security across our base and new customers. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Yes, if I go back a few years under the previous CEO, he had talked about how the Media & Entertainment business, which was a line item at that point you're providing, how in the future, he thought that as you saw more professional content come online, we saw more devices in the market like smart TVs out there to support it, that we could see an inflection in that business and that ultimately can get to a more higher sustainable growth rate than what we're seeing, at least at that point. And when I look at your revenue growth in the media business or media line item that you provided today, we're certainly seeing that acceleration. And I was just wondering if you -- what your conviction level is on the sustainability of these trends that we're seeing in the market. And is it fair to make the argument that we have seen an inflection and that one could make the argument that we should be looking at a higher growth rate for this business than what we've seen at least the last few years? F. Thomson Leighton : Well, again, revenue is the product of traffic and price when it comes to video and media. And traffic's growing, obviously, at a substantial rate. And price continues to decrease and we work hard at allowing that to happen by lowering our cost. I think, the only real way to know that there's been an inflection is to get into the future and then look back at the graph and you could say, \"Ah, that's where it happened.\" But given where we are today is, I think, you could look forward to what might be. And one of the ways we look at it, without knowing what the date is going to be, say, but you could imagine a future world with 2.5 billion people that go home at night, in prime time, watch a show. We're not there today, obviously, although you do probably have close to that number of people watching a video, at least from time to time. But say, on a typical day, they go home and they watch something online, and you can imagine a world when that's happening at a rate of about 10 megabits a second. We already have customers that are streaming at that rate. It's probably not good enough to do 4K, so we're not even thinking about a future world where 4K is ubiquitous, although maybe that will happen. But if you have that world with 2.5 billion people at 10 megabits a second, and you multiply that, that's 25,000 terabits a second. Now that's a big number. Just to put it in context, Akamai is now delivering at north of 25 terabits a second, and we're a pretty big portion of the Internet. And so you look at 25-plus today, you can imagine a future world with 25,000. Now that's a big potential growth in traffic if it were to take place. Now of course, costs are going to have to continue to come down for that to even be affordable, but we're working hard on next-generation video delivery technologies to enable that to take place, to make that be possible. So as we look to the future, we think there could be a lot more traffic that could come online and that could be very helpful for our business. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : You -- maybe that's slightly different. Do you see structurally or fundamentally -- do you have a view why either the media and Media Delivery business versus the performance and security, why one would necessarily be a faster grower long-term? F. Thomson Leighton : I think, they're different businesses, and so they're going to be affected by different things, and they'll have, I think, generally, independent growth rates. Of course, as more stuff is done online and you can have a crossover between media and performance and also security. So generally, the tailwinds are supporting the growth of all of those businesses : media, performance and security. And we're in a mode now where performance and security is growing at a faster clip than media, but both are growing at very healthy rates. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. I had a quick question. Looking at the strength that you've seen on the traffic side for the last few quarters now, is there any scenario where that would potentially start to impact CapEx, where you might have to spend more on your network infrastructure over a certain period of time to keep up with that traffic growth? F. Thomson Leighton : Good question, Jen. I think, as we've shared with you in the past, that we think of deployments over kind of a 3 to 6-month horizon, and we're building out kind of the network to support that. You certainly heard in my guidance for Q4 that I guided to kind of an uptick in CapEx and I specifically mentioned that the area that you're going to see kind of a sizable uptick is on the network side. And you can kind of take that to mean that we're doing incremental network build outs to support what we believe is going to be kind of incremental demand. And the way it works is, obviously, you try to build out the network to kind of support all the traffic that you can, the best case. And if, in fact, you don't quite hit that, you'll basically grow into that the following quarter. So I do believe we're going to be able to stay within our model on CapEx as a percent of revenue for the company. I think, I said, this year, we might be a little bit at the high end, but that's largely due to some extraordinary CapEx, some related to the Prolexic acquisition and some related to just some bigger facility and IT buildout that we're doing, but we still think, going forward, we can stay within the model range that we've outlined. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Most of my questions have been answered, but I want to focus in on the gross margin line. You showed a little bit of upside again this quarter to your guidance. And then, your Q4 guidance has about 100 basis points ahead of where consensus was. I wonder if you guys can give us just a sense of what's driving that gross margin? How much of this is mix versus kind of the structural side and just network grooming, optimization, et cetera? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes. I would say that less of it is due to mix, to be frank, and more of it is just continued work by our network and kind of media teams on driving efficiencies on the network, and that's really the more notable driver of -- and as you know, it's -- we've been on a pattern here for 3 years now where we continue to kind of grow and expand gross margins. I think, they went up a little bit. They were roughly flat from Q2 to Q3. Q4, seasonally, you do see an uptick in gross margins because you see a large growth in revenue from Q3 to Q4. And so having an uptick in margins in Q4 is not really kind of surprising, but I would expect that, I think, as I've had -- I would expect we can stay kind of within the range that we're at, and I kind of said plus or minus 1 point, and that's -- we're confident because we're confident that the work that we're doing with a bunch of things that we can continue to do to drive network efficiencies. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Jeffrey Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : Great. Just 2 quick ones. Jim, you mentioned on the sales side, with all the heads, the original goal is to target them at the performance and security solutions side. What's -- with media, my assumption was that it was a lot more penetrated. You've approached most of the Tier 1, Tier 2 properties. Can you just expand on that a little bit? Where do these people find greenfield opportunity that you decided to put resources there? James Benson : That means -- there's a lot of greenfield opportunity in media. There's certainly some in the U.S., and there's a lot outside the U.S. So a fair amount of our sales force investments have been made outside the U.S. We aren't nearly as penetrated outside the U.S. And so I would say, notably, the reps that we're adding outside the U.S. tend to be focusing a little bit more initially on kind of media, and then, also, performance and security thereafter, but that gives a little bit of color on kind of maybe where it's coming from. Jeffrey Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : Yes, that makes sense. And then, last one is, can you just give any update on the Cisco router with the embedded Akamai capabilities, I know it's early, but any variants from expectations there? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes, we're in the very early stages there. Akamai Connect is the product name that comes with the new high-end Cisco branch office router, and we have our first sales, but it's still in the very early stages. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division : I was wondering if you could comment on the trends in mobile traffic that you're seeing and how that's tying into your mobile offerings? What proportion of traffic that you're delivering is -- are you delivering it, or is it within your expectations? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes, the percentage of the transactions being done on a mobile device is increasing at a very rapid rate. Some countries, it's the majority. Here, it's less than half, but approaching half. Now the bits going to a mobile device, maybe a little bit less in terms of bits, but yes -- and it's something we have separate mobile offerings because so much of the traffic is mobile now that the Ion product line is focused on that, but it's not a separate service you buy for mobile. It covers your properties however the end user is going to access them. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chad Bartley with Pacific Crest. Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division : In terms of the guidance, the comments on the holiday season relative to the high end and low end of the range is always helpful. Can you share any similar commentary for media traffic growth rates and what the different ranges assume? F. Thomson Leighton : Yes. I mean, we don't guide specifically for media versus non-media. As I did mention, though, just to make sure that I was clear, that, I think, sometimes people think of Q3 to Q4 or Q4 being kind of holiday season and kind of more on the commerce front. And that's certainly a big driver that you have a huge commerce season in Q4, but it's also a huge traffic season, gaming releases, and there's just a lot more content that has moved online. So without giving you kind of a specific number, certainly, I will tell you that you can expect in the guide, obviously, we're expecting a very healthy growth rate off a very strong Q4 of last year. I will tell you that kind of the slowing growth at the midpoint relative to where we were in Q2 and Q3 is going to be the media business, and I think that, that's just because we believe that we don't know whether Q3's strength is going to kind of buffer maybe what we've seen historically from Q3 to Q4 at the high end. It would suggest that we continue to have a very strong seasonal traffic quarter like we've seen historically, kind of both on commerce and on media. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley Caris, Research Division : The information that you gave on the new Ion product sounds impressive. In the past, whenever you spoke about Ion versus DSA, the performance has been there, but you always mentioned that the penetration rate or at least the adoption rate amongst your customers has been low for Ion just because they are just happy with what they have with DSA. Can you talk about any changes to your go-to-market strategy or your sales strategy to convince them to upgrade to Ion, which seems like it's getting some pricing benefit as well? And my second question is regarding 2015, kind of margin indications that you've given. If you can just elaborate on that some more, where are you going to be investing? I would appreciate that. F. Thomson Leighton : All right. Well, let me take the first question. The primary driver to Ion is performance, and particularly situational performance. And that means that maybe it's the mobile user, maybe they're on a crowded cellular network, maybe they've got a different type of browser or operating system. And Ion gives much better performance and also combines with real user measurements. So you see what the real user on the site is experiencing, and that's very useful for our customers. Another big aspect of Ion is that we're making it a lot easier to use. When we first introduced Ion a little less than 2 years ago, it was pretty complicated to do the integration. And with the new Ion standard, pretty much the customer can do that themselves, and that's a big step forward. And I think, that will make it much easier for widespread adoption. And with Ion Premier, that's also easier. It still requires Akamai to help integrate, but it's much easier than it used to be. So I think, the combination of ease of use, real user metrics and substantially improved performance, especially in the increasingly important and hard area of mobile and cellular, is what drives adoption of Ion. Jim, do you want to talk about the margin? James Benson : Yes. And relative to kind of -- what I'd shared was I said they're kind of looking forward beyond Q4 that -- and I said this in the past, that we expect to operate the company in the low 40s EBITDA. I just want to make sure that I remind folks of that. And we're going to hiring in the same areas we've -- we're going to continue to hire in the sales force. We're going to continue to hire in supporting kind of go-to-market capacity. We're going to continue to hire in services. We're going to continue to hire in the technical ranks on the network side, in the products side around kind of some of the engine -- some of the areas that Tom had outlined. So it's just a continuation of the hiring and our expectation is you're going to see an acceleration in innovation and you're going to have a sales force that is going to grow. As the company gets bigger, we need a larger sales force to be able to grow at the rates we think that the market opportunity is there for, and so that is kind of the driver of kind of what's -- what I'm signaling for kind of 2015. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley Caris, Research Division : And would hiring on the sales side, would that continue to be more focused internationally? Or do you think it's -- you have opportunity domestically as well now? James Benson : Or no. Just to be clear, I mean, so we've -- our investments kind of in sales may have been a little bit more weighted towards international but we've been hiring in the U.S. as well and you can expect we'll continue to hire in the U.S. We are not nearly penetrated in the U.S. either. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with Wells Fargo. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Great. So this year, the percentage of sales through resellers has increased to about 25% from 20% last year. Why is that happening given the increase in direct sales reps? And then, how does that shift impact margins? James Benson : That's a good question. I think, I shared earlier in the year, either in Q1 or Q2, when we saw a notable uptick in the channel, some of it is that we're getting much better traction with some of our carrier partners. And admittedly, I think, I had shared this on a prior call, that what we've also done is we've ceded some of these carrier partners by customers that were direct to Akamai, we have moved some of those customers to the carrier to actually kind of help provide them a customer base to start with. So some of that growth rate is from moving customers that were direct to indirect. But kind of put that aside, we've been growing nicely in the channel space, and we've been growing nicely with the carriers in particular. And kind of the last noteworthy area is the Prolexic business had a much heavier weighting of their revenues through indirect channels than Akamai did. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then... James Benson : In the margin profile, I would say that the -- as you would -- I think, once you get the channel to scale, I think, right now, the channel does require support from Akamai, but once we can get the channel to scale better, you're going to get better margins through the channel. I'd say that they're similar now. They're not better. But I think, longer term, you're going to get kind of better margins through the channel than through the direct model. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Got it. That's really helpful. And then, you called out a 200 basis point impact from the Prolexic acquisition on the margins. Just how should we think about the timing for integration and the potential for those costs to come out at some point? James Benson : Well, I think, what we had said -- you're right, we had said that you were going to see an impact on EBITDA in kind of the near term. And we said that in the first year, that it would be dilutive of roughly $0.06 to $0.08. And I think, we're tracking pretty well to that. No real notable change from what I had shared before. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of David Dixon with FBR Capital Markets. David Michael Dixon - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Just a bigger picture question with respect to shift to HTTP/2.0 and SPDY. The question is really what's your take on the implications on the demand for Akamai? So this is going forward as we undertake that shift? Would be great. F. Thomson Leighton : Yes. I think, the modernization of the protocols are all very helpful to us. As you may know, Mark Nottingham chairs the HTTP/2.0 steering committee, he's an Akamai employee. So we're working hard to get HTTP/2.0. I think, there's another shift coming moving from HTTP to HTTPS. Of course, SPDY is a secure protocol. I think, that's going to have pretty fundamental impacts on the ecosystem when caching devices can't crack the packet anymore. So carriers are going to face network efficiency problems and traffic routing issues, and Akamai is in a great place to help there because we have a very large HTTPS business, and many of the world's leading brands work with Akamai on their secured traffic. So we're supportive of the changes that we're seeing. We're helping to lead those changes. And I think, they're good for Akamai. David Michael Dixon - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Is it correct, just on that point though, that SPDY manipulates HTTPS traffic by reducing Web page load sending it through their proxy servers? Is that an issue going forward? F. Thomson Leighton : Well, SPDY is independent of anybody's proxy servers. So that's a protocol. We support SPDY in the Akamai platform. Now HTTPS, typically, some of the cloud providers don't have HTTPS traffic proxying through them because they can't crack the packet and do anything about it. Now Akamai, with our HTTPS service, our SSL service, we do crack the packet on behalf of our content providers to accelerate their sites, to secure their sites, to offload cost from their sites. So SPDY, we support it. It is an HTTPS-based protocol. But it's -- so I'm not sure really where the question is coming from. David Michael Dixon - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Well, just the ranking, Google ranking HTTPS pages much higher than HTTP pages. I'm just wondering whether the redirection of those request going through Google proxy servers presents a challenge for the demand outlook for Akamai's services and the traffic going through Akamai servers going forward? F. Thomson Leighton : No. I think, the things you're referring to actually help us. Akamai makes the response times be better. And as you know, the major search engines favor sites that are faster. And we see many customers, when they adopt a technology like Ion, their search rankings improve, and that does drive business to us. Also as I mentioned, as you have more adoption of HTTPS, that helps the company -- helps Akamai because we carry so many of the search for the major brands, whereas other folks don't and so they are not able to provide value there. Tom Barth : Thank you, David. Thank you, Tom. I want to thank everyone for joining us this evening and in closing. We'll be having a number of investor events during the fourth quarter, and details can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Additionally, please save the date for our 2015 Investor Summit to be held on Tuesday, February 24, 2015. And we want to thank you, all, for joining us, and have a nice day.

Riley Mike Olson - Piper Jaffray Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Will Powell - Robert Baird Rishi Jaluria - JMP Operator : Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 Akamai Technologies Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Denise and I'll be the operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.  I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. Tom Barth : Thank you, Denise and good afternoon and thank you for joining Akamai's fourth quarter and year-end 2014 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. But before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the Company's view on February 10, 2015. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our Web site. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Thomson Leighton : Thanks Tom and thank you all for joining us today. Q4 was another excellent quarter for Akamai with record revenue and earnings. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $536 million, up 23% year-over-year and up 25% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Our strong revenue results continue to be driven by solid performance across all of our geographies and all of our major product lines with very strong growth coming from our security and media products. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.70 per diluted share, up 27% year-over-year. Our higher than expected earnings were aided by the end of year reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. The tax credit had a $0.05 benefit on non-GAAP EPS and was not included in the guidance that we provided you last quarter.  Our strong fourth quarter results capped off another full year of outstanding financial performance for Akamai. For the full year we grew revenue to nearly $2 billion, up 24% over 2013. We generated non-GAAP net income of $449 million or $2.48 per diluted share, up 23% over 2013 million and we continue to generate strong cash flow with over $658 million of cash from operations. I'll be back in a few minutes to talk more about the achievements and the progress that we made during 2014 as well as the opportunities that lie ahead. But first let me turn the call over to Jim to review our Q4 and full year financial results in detail and to provide the outlook for Q1. Jim? James Benson : Thank you, Tom and good afternoon everyone. As Tom outlined Akamai continued to execute well and had a great fourth quarter, closing out yet another very strong fiscal year in 2014. Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $536 million, up 8% sequentially and up 23% year-over-year despite foreign exchange headwinds. Foreign exchange movements during the quarter had a negative impact on revenue of $8 million sequentially and $10 million year-over-year. Adjusted for foreign exchange, Q4 revenues grew 9% sequentially and 25% year-over-year.  Revenue growth continued to be solid across the entire business. But the overachievement compared to our guidance was driven by exceptionally strong traffic and revenue growth in our Media Delivery solutions. I mentioned in our last call that holiday traffic would play a large role in where we would land relative to our fourth quarter guidance. And we had a tremendous burst in media related traffic in late November and December specifically. Media revenue $250 million in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year or up 23% on a constant currency basis. Traffic and revenue growth was solid across all geographies and most of the customer base with particularly strong growth coming from our largest and more strategic software update gaining social media and video delivery customers.  We are very pleased with the continued strong performance of the media business and remain bullish on the secular trend for this business looking forward. At the same time we recognize that the drivers of this business mainly traffic volumes and price can lead to revenue variability from one quarter to the next, given the timing of customer renewals at lower price points, the nature, timing and size of gaming and software releases as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities. Turning now to our performance in security solutions, revenue was $240 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year or up 27% on a constant currency basis with balanced performance across all of our geographies. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across all our major product lines, and as Tom mentioned, we continue to see exceptionally strong growth and demand for our cloud security solutions. Finally, revenue from our services and support solutions was $47 million in the quarter, up 28% year-over-year or up 31% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see very strong service attachment rates to our security solutions in particular. Turning now to our geographies. Revenue growth continued to be strong across all three major theaters. Sales in our international markets represented 26% of total revenue in Q4, down 1 point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $139 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year, or up 24% adjusted for foreign exchange. We saw solid growth in both our Asia-Pacific and EMEA markets despite continued macroeconomic headwinds. Revenue from our U.S. market was $397 million, up 26% year-over-year with solid performance across all solution categories, but most notably media. Most of this core [ph] total revenue over achievement compared to our guidance came from the U.S. where our largest software update, gaming, social media and video delivery customers reside.  And finally, revenue through channel partners represented 25% of total revenue in Q4, consistent with Q3 levels. This revenue mix is also in line with what we saw throughout 2014, driven by traction with our carrier partners in particular, as well as contribution from Prolexic's channel relationships. We expect these positive trends to continue into 2015 as a result of our ongoing investments in the channel business. Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 79%, up 1 point from both Q3 and the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 70%, up 2 points from Q3 and up 1 point from the same period last year and slightly above our guidance as we continue to execute well against our platform efficiency initiatives. GAAP operating expenses were $237 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and acquisition related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $193 million up $50 million from Q3 levels, slightly above our guidance primarily due to increased year-end commission and bonus cost associated with higher than expected revenue. Adjusted-EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $232 million, up $19 million from Q3 levels and up $40 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted-EBITDA margin came in at 43%, consistent with Q3 levels, but down 1 point in the same period last year and coming in at the high-end of our guidance given the strong revenue achievement. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $68 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $56 million, up $1 million from Q3 levels and in line with guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $175 million up $18 million from Q3 and up $27 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 33%, up 1 point from Q3 levels and down 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. Moving onto the other income and expense items, interest income for the fourth quarter was roughly $2 million, up slightly from Q3 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $97 million or $0.54 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $127 million or $0.70 of earnings per diluted share and coming in $0.04 above the high-end of our guidance range. As Tom mentioned earlier, the reinstatement of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit late in December was not included in our guidance and positively impacted non-GAAP net income by $9 million or $0.05 of earnings per diluted share. Excluding this tax benefit, our non-GAAP earnings would have been $0.65 per diluted share, coming in at the higher end of our guidance driven by the strong revenue performance. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $37 million, based on an effective tax rate of 27%. This rate is down 4 points year-over-year primarily related to the R&D tax credit I just mentioned. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $51 million based on an effective tax rate of 28% and coming in about 4 points lower than our guidance range, again due to the R&D tax credit. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 181 million shares consistent with Q3 levels and in line with our guidance. With our strong fourth quarter results, we finished the year with nearly $2 billion in revenue, an increase of 24% over 2013 or an increase of 25% when adjusted for foreign exchange.  Full year cash gross margin was 78% and GAAP gross margin was 69% both up 1 point from the prior year and representing the third straight year of expanding gross margins. Our improvements in this area are a direct result of the ongoing exceptional work by our engineering and network teams to implement a number of hardware and software initiatives to manage our global network more efficiently. Full year GAAP operating expenses were $863 million. These GAAP numbers include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock based compensation, restructuring charges and acquisition related charges. Excluding these charges full year non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $688 million, or 35% of total revenues up 2 points through 2013 levels. As we discussed throughout 2014, we are committed to investing organically and through M&A to drive innovation and future growth. We added nearly 1200 employees across the Company in 2014, focused primarily in sales and supporting go-to-market capacity, service and customer support staffing, network efficiency scaling, engineering innovation and company infrastructure scaling, and we plan to continue hiring in these areas in 2015.  Full year adjusted-EBITDA was $853 million, up 22% from 2013 and full year adjusted-EBITDA margin was 43%, down a point from the prior year. Fully GAAP net income was $334 million or $1.84 of earnings per diluted share for 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the year was $449 million, or $2.48 of earnings per diluted share. That\u2019s up 23% from 2013 levels. This number includes full year non-GAAP taxes of $205 million based on a full year non-GAAP tax rate of 31%. Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Day sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was 56 days down four days from Q3 level and up one day from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q1 excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $98 million, slightly above the high-end of our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to network build-outs in anticipation of future traffic demand. We plan to continue with this aggressive build-out moving into 2015. As a reminder this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities.  Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Cash from operations was a $196 million in the fourth quarter or 36% of revenue and $658 million for the full year, or 34% of revenue. During the quarter we spent $42 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 700,000 shares at an average price of just under $60. For the year we spent nearly $270 million, buying back approximately 4.6 million shares at an average price of $58. As of Q4 end we had $434 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet also remains very strong, with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $900 million. As we've discussed in the past we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times. As always, our overall goal is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable return in a manner we believe is in the best long-term interest of the Company and our shareholders. In summary, we are very pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and throughout 2014. We continue to execute well, delivered strong revenue growth, manage network cost effectively and made the necessary investments in the business that we believe are building a foundation for sustained long-term growth. Looking ahead to the first quarter and 2015, we expect significant foreign exchange headwinds from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. At current spot rates foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue of $7 million, compared to Q4 and $50 million compared to Q1 of last year. In addition the currency headwinds, while we expect another solid media quarter in Q1, we do anticipate a moderation in media growth rates heading into 2015 driven by a few factors. First, as I discussed earlier Q4 revenue growth benefited from exceptionally strong holiday traffic which we expect will abate. Second, in Q1 of 2014 we benefited from several large software and gaming releases as well as the Sochi Olympics, which makes for a more difficult compare this quarter. Lastly, while contract renewals at lower price points occur every quarter, we expect the impact of recent renewals to have a slightly greater impact on media growth rates in the first quarter. That said, it is important to note that the rate of decline in media pricing and renewal time has remained consistent with prior years and that media business is strong, with revenues projected to grow at a very healthy rate in 2015, just not at the record 2014 levels.  Factoring in these items, we are expecting another strong quarter with Q1 revenue in the range of $517 million to $534 million. This range represents 17% to 21% growth adjusted for foreign exchange movements over a very strong first quarter last year. At these revenue levels we expect cash gross margins of 78% down one point from Q4 levels and GAAP gross margins of 68%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be a $189 million to a $193 million, roughly in line with Q4 levels as commission accelerated reset at the beginning of the year offset with continued headcount investments across the business.  Factoring in all these items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 41% to 42%. As I have been messaging in prior calls, looking beyond Q1 we expect to be in the low EBIT -- low 40 EBITDA range, or more precisely in the 40% to 42% EBITDA range as we plan to continue making the necessary investments that we believe will help drive Akamai's future growth and scale. Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $59 million to $60 million, up from Q4 levels due to increases from both our Q4 and planned Q1 network build-outs and the capitalization of several large software projects. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.60 to $0.63. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $50 million to $53 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 32%. This tax rate is a few points higher than what we saw in the fourth quarter for two reasons. First Q4 included a full year benefit from the U.S federal R&D tax credit that was reinstated for fiscal year 2014. And second, Congress did not approve an extension of the tax credit into 2015. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of roughly 181 million shares. On CapEx we expect to spend approximately $125 million to $130 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. These levels are higher than what we have spent in recent quarters, primarily driven by a continuation of our network investments to support the continued growth of our customers with large, global end user foot prints and an expected increase in a number of complex live events. In addition, the timing of some facility build-outs required to support our headcount growth also contributes to the uptick in Q1 CapEx. We expect Q1 to be the high watermark for quarterly CapEx spend in 2015 with full year 2015 annual CapEx as a percentage of revenue projected to be roughly consistent with 2014 levels. In closing, we accomplished a great deal in 2014 and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for both the short-term and long-term. We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and future trends in the industry at our upcoming Investor's Summit in Boston on February 24. Now let me turn the call back over to Tom. Thomson Leighton : Thanks, Jim. By every financial measure, 2014 was an excellent year for Akamai, with robust growth on both top and bottom-lines, strong performance across all our geographies and product lines and solid execution on our business strategy. We believe that our excellent financial results validate the soundness of our strategy and the continued market opportunities for our offerings and we are continuing to focus on the four grand challenges faced by our customers; delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale and affordability; providing near instant performance for websites and apps on any device, anywhere; protecting websites and data centers from cyber-attacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to efficiently handle new cloud workloads.  At the Consumer Electronics Show last month I met with several of our major media customers and partners. They told me that they are experiencing rapidly increasing demand for online video and they are turning to Akamai as the leading provider of solutions with high quality and scale. In order to capture the anticipated growth in media traffic, we plan to continue making investments in innovative media, technology and network build-out.  As you might imagine security is also becoming a primary concern for major media companies, and Akamai is very well positioned to help with our Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Routed Solutions. I am very happy to report that as the first anniversary of the Prolexic acquisition approaches we are well on track to achieving all of the success metrics that we established for the acquisition; including meeting our 2014 revenue targets, extending the Prolexic security operation center capabilities in Fort Lauderdale to centers in Tokyo, Bangalore and Krakow, and retaining key customers and employees.  Of course security is a top concern for customers across many verticals. As cyber-attacks have continued to increase in scale and sophistication, more and more enterprises are leveraging Akamai's massively distributed platform as an outer layer of defense while preserving site performance and availability. As a result security has continued to be our fastest growing product category. At the end of 2014 nearly 1,700 customers were using our security products with more than 900 having purchased one or both of our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Routed Solutions. In addition to cyber-attacks, there are several other factors that make it hard to deliver a fast and reliable web experience. Web sites are richer, heavier and more interactive, which means that they require more time to deliver. Internet peering points and cell powers are becoming more congested, which slows everything down. And more business applications are moving online, which saturates enterprise network capacity. Akamai built the Ion product line to help address these performance challenges. Ion is equipped with numerous real-time optimizations and is particularly well suited for use with mobile devices. Ion helps our customers expand revenue opportunities with improved performance, increased scalability and reduced infrastructure cost. As a result, 96 of the Internet retailer 100 companies use Akamai to accelerate their Web sites and over one-third have upgraded to Ion since it was launched two years ago. In October of last year, we expanded the Ion product line with the launch of Ion Standard and Ion Premier. Ion Standard provides industry leading web performance in a fully self-serviceable package to help companies realize value quickly. For customers whose online businesses require even more performance, such as top Internet retailers, Ion Premier offers additional optimizations that can be customized to provide the maximum possible performance benefit. I am proud of what Akamai accomplished in 2014 and I believe that our achievements attest to the sound fundamentals of our strategy and innovative technology. I am very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Akamai in 2015 and beyond. Thank you for your time today. Now Jim and I will take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question come from Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Jennifer Lowe : Jim, I wanted to drill in the sort of the commentary around the '15 outlook a little bit. And firstly you mentioned that there were some contracts that were coming up for renewal and I would assume marking back down the market rate and that's kind of the normal course of business, but you had a similar impact in '14 when I think your largest media customer came up for renewal right at the beginning of the year and saw a reset there. So I'm just curious to contextualize the impact of the effective pricing declines you set this year versus last year when you also had a big contract that came up and reset? And then sort of secondly, you talked a bit about the expectations around media growth being slower in '15 versus '14. If it is the performance in security business that's been a more stable performer if you take out the Prolexic inorganic benefit. So is there any reason to think that the trajectory around performance should change at all in '15? James Benson : Sure I'll take your -- so your first question around kind of media that I think it's important to kind of have as a backdrop that we grew the media business in 2014 21%. You're not going to grow the media business 21% every year. So we're coming off a record year for the media business and we're coming off a record quarter, where we grew the media business 23%. So our growth in the media business in 2014 has been exceptional. And so we still expect growth in the media business to be very strong. I mentioned three areas. If not, you kind of highlighted one of them. One is we had a very, very strong burst in November and December for media related traffic. We would expect that to abate just because the holiday season is over. Two, we had several large gaming and software releases last Q1. So it makes for a little bit more of a difficult compare. And the third is, as I said we do have large customers that renew every quarter. They don\u2019t renew linearly. So it's not like a 25% a quarter renew. So there's going to be some quarters that a few more renew than other quarters and that's exactly what is happening this quarter. It's nothing really notable. The pricing changes that we're seeing are in line with what we've seen with historical patterns. So we've not seen an increase or a decrease in the rate of pricing erosion. It just means and really just so that we're clear, I was really signaling more for media growth in Q1, obviously being driven by the reset from a couple more contract reprises than usual, but we still expect very strong growth rates in the media business, just not in the low 20s. And relative to performance and security, you are right that that business, to adjust it for a kind of -- foreign exchange has been growing very consistently and we would expect that business to be relatively stable -- a stable grower going into 2015. Operator : Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Sterling Auty : In the past spikes in CapEx spending like the investment you're talking about have been a precursor to volume growth. You mentioned that you expect that again. But what I'm curious about is in the context of what you're seeing now, what gives you the visibility and confidence of being able to capture the same percentage of that growth opportunity as you have in the past? James Benson : Yes, you are right that we have reasonably good visibility from talking to our customers around traffic demand. We certainly have good visibility in the near term, and as we told you before, when we build out CapEx we're building our CapEx really to achieve what we believe is going to be highest possibility of traffic growth that we could get. We want to make sure we're building up the network to take traffic for our customers. That\u2019s effectively what we are doing. If in fact we don\u2019t see the traffic demand materialize, we can always notch CapEx down in future quarters. And so you are right. What we're signaling here is confidence that we believe that it is going to be a nice uptick in traffic going into 2015 even beyond Q1. But if we don\u2019t see that happen obviously we'll ratchet CapEx down later in the year. But that\u2019s not what we're expecting right now. Sterling Auty : And then second, in your prepared remarks you mentioned the holiday traffic, holiday media traffic spike a couple of times. I want to make sure that we're clear. What specifically is that media traffic that you are seeing? What\u2019s the source of it that seasonally falls off? James Benson : So I think we talked in the past that there's basically four big secular trends in the business that have been driving media traffic and revenue growth for the Company. One is been obviously the continued adoption of video delivery through streaming and things of that nature. Two is you're going to -- there's going to be some quarters where you have more software updates than normal, some quarters you're going to have more gaming releases than normal, and certainly social media as a platform has been continuing to grow and innovate over the last several years, and so what you had in Q4 was a four for four that we did well in gaming, we did well in software updates, we did well in social media, we did well in video delivery. You do tend to see it spike around the holiday. People consume more videos. There tend to be more patches and gaming releases that tend to occur around the holidays and that\u2019s effectively what we saw. So it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s fairly normal to see traffic patterns kind of not be at the same levels going into Q1 and that\u2019s what we're expecting and that\u2019s what we're flagging in our guidance. But again to be clear, we are still expecting strong growth in our media business. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please proceed. Steve Milunovich : First, you didn\u2019t indicate the EPS impact in the first quarter from currency. I wonder if you care to talk about that and if you're going to be hedging any more aggressively going forward, and second, could you update us on your sales hiring? It seems like you've been lagging a little bit behind your goals last couple of quarters. Where are we in terms of both hiring and the efficiency of those sales people coming up the curve? Thomson Leighton : Good question on the earnings impact, that as I mentioned that we're seeing a sequential headwind of about $8 million and about a $50 million headwind year-over-year due to foreign exchange on the top-line. More of our spending is in U.S. dollars. So you can expect that there's going to be a more notable flow through into earnings impact from that revenue drop. So if you do recall it -- call it a roughly 50% flow through on that, maybe a little bit more than that. So you're talking a penny or two pennies in earnings year-on-year. And relative to sales hiring, actually we had a great quarter for sales hiring. You were right. We were a little bit behind earlier in the year. We caught up a little bit in Q3. We had a strong hiring quarter in Q4 and delivered to kind of a plan that we expected actually a little bit better than we had expected ending the year. And we continue to see good momentum with the efficiency of the sales hiring. And as I mentioned before in other calls that I think what we have found -- this maybe have been an issue when we started to hire, we thought that sales focus would be more concentrated to call it performance and security solutions. And really what we have found is they're selling the entire portfolio, and so some of the performance that we are seeing in media is a result of good execution by the sales team on selling media is well as performance and security. So I'd say we are tracking pretty well and we expect to continue to ramp sales hiring in 2015. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed. Michael Turits : Two questions. First, kind of a center competitive question but maybe from the angle that it seems as if the growth rates are consistently slower from all the competitors that report numbers. So any change or just you guys are killing it and that\u2019s it? Thomson Leighton : We continue to have substantial competition. The competition varies on the product line and -- but we're executing very well. We've made substantial progress in improving our quality, our scalability at an affordable price point, providing excellent security defenses for our customers. And so we've have been very successful. Michael Turits : Okay, and then on the P&L side, you called out security. Any more detail? You got any good customers? Any more granularity there? And then also perhaps on some of the -- maybe we could call them emerging areas that you've highlighted in some of the Analyst Days on the PNS side including carrier and hybrid club. Thomson Leighton : Certainly the most -- the fastest growing business within Performances and Security is the security business. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we actually had pretty solid growth across most of the major product lines in performance in security, but certainly the noteworthy call out at security, it's been -- it was noteworthy last year and it\u2019s been strong all year. I think the addition of the Prolexic capabilities really has enhanced the Company\u2019s portfolio. I will at the Investor Summit, I will breakout each one of the performance and security solution groups a little bit deeper for you, so that you can see how each one of them did for the full year. But I can tell you that certainly securities leading the way, you'll see that it was pretty solid growth across the Board, but certainly is the most noteworthy being security. And I think the emerging areas, one of the things that we had talked about the announcement certainly of our Cisco partnership in Q3. We were -- we had told you that we didn\u2019t expect any material revenue from the Cisco partnership in 2014, but we've seen a number of proof of concepts. The quality of customers that we're attracting here gives us some optimism that we should see some hopefully -- some further acceleration here in 2015. Operator : Our next question comes from James Breen with William Blair. Please proceed. James Breen : Just a couple of questions. One on sort of the currency impact to revenue. You talked about $15 million year-over-year. When you sort of add that to the midpoint of guidance, it implies sort of constant currency growth around 19% for the first quarter. Just thinking about how it trends during the year, since it appears that a lot of currency, the strength in the dollar happened in the back half of \u201914. Should we expect that year-over-year revenue growth which right now is about 16% based on your guidance in the first quarter to sort of tick up throughout the year? And then secondly, just can you update us sort of who is your larger customers in terms of potential revenue? I think your largest customer at the end of last year was around 9% or so. Has that changed? James Benson : On the FX impact, the way you should think about it, if you look at foreign exchange rates throughout 2014, actually the dollar weakened in the first half of 2014 and then strengthened in the second half. So what you'll see is it will be a headwind on growth rates for probably the first two quarters and then it will be less so in Q3 and Q4. And relative to -- we don\u2019t breakout revenue concentration, we don\u2019t have any 10% revenue customers and I would say while we have some sizable customers, we don\u2019t have any customers that are near 10%. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Sanderson with MKM Partners. Please proceed. Rob Sanderson : You mentioned a third of your e-commerce customers upgraded to Ion. Can you talk through what a typical ARPU looks like on Ion versus DSF? I know that customers are very different, but can you sort of help us think about what kind of incremental revenue opportunity is there? And then second customer count, can you give us an update or a way to think about as cloud and SaaS more mainstream how applicable is the Akamai solution into the hundreds of thousands of mainstream enterprise customers. How does management think about that? How should we think about that? Thomson Leighton : Okay, so we said that a third of the Internet Retailer 100 had upgraded to Ion, and the ARPU lift is something that we don\u2019t talk about but we have seen lift and of course the service provides much faster performance for Web sites and is particularly tailored for the mobile environment. And we're getting to the point now where close to half of online transactions are on mobile devices. So mobile performance really matters. That's been a big shift over the last few years. A few years ago almost no transactions were on mobile devices.  We don\u2019t talk about the customer counts in general, but I can tell you we are focused on the 1,000 customers out there and not really on hundreds of thousands of customers. Now that said, we do have channel partners and resellers who do focus on that segment, and so they tend to that calculation of enterprises. In terms of our direct sale where we would count customers, it\u2019s focused on you want to think of as thousands of customers, not hundreds of thousands. James Benson : Well I think it\u2019s a fair color Tom to your point on channels that we had an exceptional channel quarter and an exceptional channel year. The carrier partnerships that we've announced over the last couple of years are bearing fruit. That\u2019s our fastest growing -- of our channel partners, the carrier partners are our fastest growing, but the indirect channel is growing faster than our direct business. So I think to Tom\u2019s point we're focusing our direct sales force in the right areas for our Enterprise class customers and then that\u2019s not to say that our channel partners are not focused in those areas as well, but they can go a little bit deeper and get broader penetration for the Company. Operator : Our next question comes from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Gray Powell : Just a couple if I may. In the past you cited total ARPU for the security business I think in around $7,000 per month with Kona closer to 14,000 per month versus the site acceleration side at 20,000. How should we think about the potential for security if the ARPUs improve and how long do you think it takes for penetration security to match the site acceleration side of your business? Thomson Leighton : Yes I'll provide the details of the security ARPUs at the Investor Summit. It's a little teaser for you to come. I will tell you that the ARPUs are increasing in Security. As you mentioned that it's -- you have to look at the broad security portfolio. Kona Site Defender and Prolexic have much higher ARPUs than kind of our standard web application firewall and other security offering. So it's been growing and I'll provide the specific numbers at the Investor Summit later this month. Gray Powell : And then just maybe one follow up if I may, sticking with security. Just how should we think about the product roadmap there? Any tangential areas that look interesting to you? Thomson Leighton : Yes, we are now in Beta with a client reputation service to identify IP addresses that have behaved with -- had malicious behavior in the past, and to identify the nature of what's sitting behind an IP address. And the customer interest there in the Beta stage has been high. And as we look farther into the future, we're looking at enterprise security. As you know, we have the cloud networking division with its first product being Akamai Connect sold by Cisco, and as we start dealing with enterprise traffic, obviously the building to secure that and protect the enterprise employee becomes a very interesting area to apply our security expertise. Operator : Our next question come from Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Please proceed. Sameet Sinha : A couple of questions. You gave us some data on DSA and the penetration of the IR 500 -- sorry IR 100. Can you talk about the Ion Prime? What sort of penetration -- what sort of go-to-market strategy that has? And also if you could provide equivalent data on the Internet Retailer 500, sort of your level of penetration and what sort of market? Is it the entire 500 or do you think just the top 100 are kind of the key markets for Ion Prime? Then secondly Jim, for every time that you said low 40s EBITDA margin. I would have been a rich man if I got a penny every time. What exactly are you spending on? I can understanding hiring real-estate. Can you give us a little more detail and kind of how we should think about this spending through the year? Thomson Leighton : Let me take the first question. DSA, Dynamic Site Accelerator was our former flagship acceleration product and then we launched the Ion line a couple of years ago and then last October we launched Ion Standard and Ion Premier. The way to think about Ion Standard is that it's really easy to use, really easy to configure. You can sort of turn it on yourself and so it allows an enterprise to quickly get a lot of their sites and applications going with very strong performance gains. And Ion Premier is more of a customized capability. So they are the sites that care the most about performance, are willing to put effort into really optimizing that, really tuning it for all the different kinds of devices that are out there, they would want to get Ion Premier. Now if you think about Internet Retailers, they're obviously in the sweet spot for Ion Premier, because it's well known that if your site is faster, you sell a lot more on it and that's why we have such strong adoption of our services in the IR 100. We also have very good adoption in the IR 250 and IR 500. Don\u2019t think we released the statistics there, but commerce as a whole, there's certainly a sweet spot for web performance capabilities. James Benson : Yes. And on your question on low 40s, I'm only chuckling because you're right. I have signaled that we're going to operate in the low 40s. I will remind you though that what has driven the Company not operating in the low 40s to-date is that we've had significant revenue growth and over achievement beyond our expectation. So the Company grew in constant currency 25% last year. That was certainly higher than what we had planned. We expanded gross margins for the third straight year. That was better than we had expected. So we have been spending in the areas that I outlined, and I talked about sales and supporting go-to-market capacity, I talked about services and support, I talked about kind of investments in network scaling, I talked about investments in R&D and innovation, and we're also making investments in Company infrastructure scaling. So you can expect that we're going to continue to do those things. We're not going to grow every -- I would love to think every year we can grow 25%. Maybe we can. We're not certainly signaling that here with our guidance for Q1. And so what I'm trying to signal to you is that that's the intent of the Company, to manage the Company in the range of 40% to 42% EBITDA. So I don\u2019t want anyone to be surprised if and when that happens. Operator : Our next question come from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. Mike Olson : I know International's been a bigger focus over the last few quarters and years, but it hasn\u2019t really grown as a percent of the revenue mix and it seems like maybe that\u2019s been in the category a good problem to have because domestic growth has maybe just bit stronger than expected. But how do you see that tending over the next few quarters and maybe next couple of years? Is that a focus on new sales force hires? Do you kind of feel like you've been maybe leaving business on the table by not having as strong of a sales presence outside the U.S.? Definitely it seems like that could be another lever of growth in the coming years. Thanks. Thomson Leighton : Yes, actually you hit the nail on the head that we're pleased with the international growth. It's just that our domestic business grew much faster than we had expected. And our largest customers in the media business in particular tend to reside U.S. And so really we drove and fueled kind of the overachievement in the media growth rates in particular, we had strong growth across the Board but we had particularly strong growth with our large media customers, which tend to sit, more of them -- not all of them but more of them tend to sit in the U.S. So we're very pleased with the international growth. It\u2019s just we had exceptional growth in the Americas. And you're right, going forward from a sales hiring perspective, actually we have -- roughly 50% of our sales reps are already outside the U.S. So the hiring we've been doing over the last couple of years has been more weighted to international because we believe we are less penetrated outside the U.S. than we are in the U.S. We certainly have opportunities in all markets but we believe there is significantly more Greenfield opportunity outside the U.S. and you're starting to see us get traction for some of the sales force hiring that we've done and plan to do going forward.  So I would expect that you will see the international revenue as a mix percent grow in the future. It'd be nice to the have the problem we have right now, which is it may not grow because the domestic business grows equally which would be a nice problem to have, but we do expect that probably in the future that the International business mix will be a little bit higher than what we've seen to date. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys this is [indiscernible] for Phil. Most of my questions have been answered but I want to focus on our gross margin line. Looking at the 2014 gross margin, it went up from 2013. You talked about some of this network grooming and improving optimization et cetera. So wondering if you could also give us some color on co-location and bandwidth expenses you are seeing there and sort of changes you might expect to see. And how should we think about that going forward in 2015? Thomson Leighton : I think we've talked about that. We've made good progress on managing bandwidth cost. So bandwidth cost per megabit per second continues to go down. Obviously the total cost for traffic reserve is going down at a greater rate in pace than what we're seeing in pricing erosion. But we've done a good job on optimizing on the co-lo side, we've done a job of optimizing on the bandwidth size and some of it has been hardware initiative, some of it has been software initiatives that our team has driven. We certainly have some buying leverage because we are a huge purchaser of bandwidth, given the amount of traffic that we serve.  So I think we're very, very pleased with the work that we done on the network side and we expect that we can continue to keep pace with what we've been doing. I'm not calling that -- obviously in this guidance for gross margin expansion but we think we can get gross margin stabilization on the cash gross margin side. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please proceed. Colby Synesael : Great, two questions if I may. First off on CapEx intensity. I think Company\u2019s long-term high-end target is about 16%. I think this year you spent just over 17%. I think the guidance for this year is expected to be roughly flat at 17%. Is it fair to say that the capital intensity of the business is just slightly higher than what you previously anticipated and that that 17% is a good longer-term number for us to be thinking about? And then also on APRU, so the one metric you do provide is servers and certainly if you look at total revenue divided by servers you actually saw revenue per server go up about 7% and 7.5% in 2014 and if we look at our model for last six years, it\u2019s gone down every single year. Can you help talk about what actually happened in 2014 that you think drove revenue on a per server basis? And I guess is that sustainable? James Benson : So on the CapEx intensity side, so you're right. We landed at 17% for 2014 and I signaled that we're probably going to be at that rate for 2015. I think it\u2019s important to parse our CapEx. Half of that are or call it 8 points of the 17% is network CapEx, which several years ago was roughly 10% of revenue. So we've seen nice scale on network CapEx. I'd say the one area Colby that's probably been a more notable uptake in CapEx is around capitalized software, which I think is a good thing, because as that from an accounting perspective when we invest in R&D resources, when they're working on specific software development work, we capitalize that and that turns into CapEx. And the way to think about that is that\u2019s future product innovation that\u2019s about to be released. That\u2019s probably a little bit higher than what we had expected. I'm not going to signal on this call kind of an adjustment to the long-term model for the Company. We will provide an update at the IR summit where I'll talk about the trends in the business and I'll talk about the kind of the long-term model for the Company then. And on your revenue per server, yes we don't believe that's a very good metric to be quite frank. I know that maybe in the old days people have looked at that. So I'm not sure looking at revenue per server is a meaningful measure for the Company. We're always doing refreshers of servers on the network. And so I don't think necessarily looking at it just on a server basis is a way of looking at efficiency. I think the way you can look at efficiency is looking at our network CapEx as a percent of revenue. Our network CapEx as a percent of revenue has gone down. It was 10% two or three years ago. It's now 8%. So you're seeing efficiency in our -- the CapEx intensity on the network side as evidenced by a nice steady decline and now a stabilization of network CapEx as a percent of revenue. Colby Synesael : Yes, I was just going to add, obviously you continue to provide servers. So to some degree one might think that there might be some value in that. And I guess the other question is obviously there's been a lot of questions on ARPU this quarter. And based on the fact that you're saying that revenue per server is not a good number, it might be helpful at some point for you guys to potentially provide some more metrics on that if it's at all possible? Thanks. Operator : Sure. Our next question comes from Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed. Jeff Van Rhee : Two brief ones guys. Just wanted to understand on a sales hiring, the sense of magnitude of what we should expect in '15 in terms of the ads I think you had originally said maybe a 100 for '14. It sounds like you came in just a bit ahead of that. So thoughts, if you can dial in a little bit around '15. And then just one brief one on the new customer versus existing customer mix. Is there tasking or incentives in place in terms of sales and sales leadership that target specifically the new versus existing up sells and how we should think about that? James Benson : Yes. And so we're not going to specifically guide to an incremental number of sales resources every year. We did that back in -- when we started to ramp the sales force investments. I think you can expect that we'll add a similar number of rep hires every year for what we've done in the last couple of years, and that's anywhere between kind of call it 80 and 100. So you can expect that we'll continue to do that.  And relative to where they're focused on new versus existing, as you can imagine when we do territory planning, they plan territories with that in mind, around size of customer, Greenfield opportunities. But again I think from a rep perspective that you're going to have some hunters, you're going to have some farmers, you're going to have some hybrid reps. And so I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag based on the territories that we put them in. So there isn't necessarily an incentive for them to sell more on the new customer side versus existing customer. If we can grow the business through existing customers, we're happy to have that happen. If we can grow the business through new customers, we're happy to have that happen. And we think we have a pretty balanced go-to-market approach to do both. Operator : Our next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed. Thomson Leighton : Ed? I think you are on mute. Okay. Denise, we can maybe go back to Ed. Let's take the next one please. Operator : Sure our next question comes from Will Powell with Robert Baird. Please proceed. Will Power : I guess a couple of questions. Maybe first Jim, just to maybe come back to the currency outlook quickly, the EBITDA margin guidance for the year, 40% to 42% any sense for what the FX impact is on that? What that might look like on a constant currency basis. And then the second question, just with all these upcoming streaming video offers on the horizon, of course LinkTV I guess launching, HBO, others coming, maybe any color as to how you think about the emerging or I guess increasing opportunity there generally and any specifics around any of these new particular players that you might be able to make comments around? James Benson : So yes, I'm glad you brought the FX impact. So interestingly enough that FX impact is about 1 point year-on-year on EBITDA. So FX alone is about a 1 point impact on kind of the company EBITDA if you look at it on a constant currency basis. So it is meaningful for the Company as I mentioned because we have more of our cost in U.S dollars. And relative to kind of -- I think there's a bunch of trends going on in media space. You mentioned a few. There's going to -- there is a bunch of new offerings -- there's going to be more over the top capabilities and that's going to need to be served by some platform. We think that certainly Akamai is one of those platforms that could serve some of those capabilities. We certainly signaled with the CapEx build-out that we're doing on the network side that we're pretty bullish on traffic growth here going into 2015. So you can expect that we're going to hopefully capitalize on some of what continues to be an emerging trend of traffic growth across all the media. You mentioned one -- social media continues to innovate. Streaming continues to be an area that's growing rapidly. There needs to be more and more gaming releases and software updates. So we're pretty optimistic about the media business going forward. Thomson Leighton : Yes. As you look father in the future, there is a possibility of a tremendous amount of traffic from video to come online. Today the penetration rates online are very low. When you combine that with the emerging technologies, technologies like 4K, maybe someday 8K, and what that means that for one hour of watching, actually a lot more traffic has to flow to produce the quality. So there is a really tremendous potential for growth, which is why we are so bullish media business and we're are investing for the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg McDowell with JMP. Please proceed. Rishi Jaluria : This is Rishi Jaluria dialing in for Greg McDowell. Two quick ones if I may. First, in terms of your security offerings with Kona and Prolexic and your success that you pointed to there, are you typically finding yourself gaining new, gaining customers by up selling to existing Akamai customers or are you actually getting new customers that weren\u2019t with Akamai or with Prolexic prior. And then second in terms of the quarter, it sounds like you had a strong quarter in retail and in e-commerce. I just wanted to see if there any -- are there particular verticals that you saw strength or weakness in that you wanted to point to. Thomson Leighton : On the Security side the good news is we're seeing both strong upsell in our existing base and also new customers, customers that for whatever reason haven\u2019t done business with Akamai before but are in the market for a Security product. We have a very compelling pair of offers, Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Routed. And then that's great because we're seeing several examples where we once we get them on the Akamai platform with security, then we can upsell them with our traditional solutions with application acceleration. James Benson : Yes, in most of the verticals, certainly the media and entertainment vertical had significant growth given what I talked about. But we saw a good growth in the commerce vertical, we saw good growth across our enterprise verticals. We had pretty growth across almost all of our verticals, probably with the one exception being on the public sector side that we probably haven\u2019t seen as much growth in that vertical, but we didn\u2019t expect see significant growth in that vertical but I think across the Board, with the exception of the public sector we've had pretty strong growth. Thomson Leighton : Okay. Thank you Denise. Thank you, everyone. In closing, as Jim mentioned we hope to see you live or via Web cast, via the Akamai platform at our 2015 Investor Summit to be held on February 24th in Boston. In addition we'll be presenting at a number of investor conferences in March. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section at akamai.com. And thank you for joining us and have a nice evening. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect. Have a great day everyone.",

LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2015 Akamai Technologies, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Joyce and I will be the operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Thank you, Joyce, and good afternoon, and thank everyone for joining Akamai's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on April 28, 2015. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q1 was another strong quarter for Akamai and a great start to the year on both the top line and bottom line. Revenue in the first quarter was $527 million, up 16% year-over-year and up 20% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Our strong revenue results continued to be driven by solid performance across all of our geographies and all of our major product lines, with especially rapid growth from our Cloud Security Solutions. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.61 per diluted share, up 5% year-over-year and up 12% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. I'll be back in a few minutes to talk more about the progress that we made during the first quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead. But first, let me turn the call over to Jim to review our Q1 financial results in detail and to provide the outlook for Q2. Jim? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom just highlighted, Akamai had a strong first quarter, with solid performance across the entire business. Q1 revenue came in just above the midpoint of our guidance range at $527 million, up 16% year-over-year or up 20% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds. Media revenue was $242 million in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year or up 16% on a constant currency basis. These growth rates are particularly strong when you consider our very strong Q1 of 2014, which benefited from several large software and gaming releases as well as the Sochi Olympics. Traffic and revenue growth was solid across all geographies and most of the customer base, with continued strength in our largest and most strategic accounts. We are pleased with the continued strong performance of the Media business and remain bullish on the secular trends for this business going forward. Turning now to our Performance and Security Solutions. Revenue was $245 million in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year, or up 25% on a constant currency basis, with balanced performance across all of our geographies. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines. And as Tom mentioned, we continued to see strong growth in demand for our Cloud Security Solutions. To help provide increased visibility into the performance of our Cloud Security Solutions, we're going to start reporting revenue on a quarterly basis. Cloud Security Solutions revenue was $55 million in the first quarter, up 82% year-over-year or up 87% on a constant currency basis. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $40 million in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year, or up 16% on a constant currency basis. New customer attachment rates for our enterprise-class professional services and enhanced customer support continued to be healthy during the quarter. Turning now to our geographies. Revenue growth continued to be solid across all our major geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 26% of total revenue in Q1, consistent with the prior quarter. International revenue was $138 million in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year, or up 21% on a constant currency basis. Currency fluctuations continue to weigh on growth rates and had a negative impact on revenue of over $17 million on a year-over-year basis and over $8 million on a sequential basis, as the dollar continued to strengthen throughout the quarter. On a constant currency basis, we saw solid growth in both our Asia-Pacific and EMEA markets. Revenue from our U.S. market was $389 million, up 20% year-over-year, with solid performance across all solution categories. And finally, revenue through our channel partners represented 26% of total revenue in Q1, up one point from the prior quarter. Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 78%, down one point from the prior quarter and consistent with the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 68%, down two points from the prior quarter and down one point from the same period last year, also in line with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $236 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $189 million, down $4 million from the prior quarter and at the low end of our guidance due to some planned hiring that shifted into the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $223 million, down $8 million from Q4 levels and up $20 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 42%, down one point from Q4 levels and down three points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $70 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $61 million, up $4 million from Q4 levels and roughly in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $163 million, down $12 million from Q4 and up $4 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 31%, down two points from Q4 levels and down four points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. Moving on to other income and expense items, interest income for the first quarter was roughly $3 million, up slightly from Q4 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings : GAAP net income for the first quarter was $78 million, or $0.43 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $111 million, or $0.61 of earnings per diluted share, and coming in at the midpoint of our guidance range. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $42 million, based on an effective tax rate of 35%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $54 million based on an effective tax rate of 33%. This tax rate is one point higher than our guidance due to a revised full-year 2015 tax rate projection that takes into account the negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on projected 2015 foreign earnings. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 181 million shares, consistent with Q4 levels and in line with our guidance. Now, I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 59 days, up three days from Q4 levels and up one day from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $123 million, slightly below the low end of our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to some planned Q1 facility and network capacity investments shifting into Q2. As a reminder, this CapEx number includes capitalized software development activities. Cash flow generation continued to be solid. Cash from operations for the first quarter was $100 million. During the quarter, we spent $63 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 900,000 shares at an average price of just over $67. At the end of Q1, we had approximately $371 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet also remains very strong, with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $825 million. As we've discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times. We took advantage of this to purchase Xerocole in Q1 and Octoshape at the beginning of Q2, all cash deals that we believe position us well for further innovation. As always, our overall goal is to deploy our capital in a manner we believe is in the best long-term interests of the company and our shareholders. In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q1. We continued to execute well, delivered strong revenue growth, managed network cost effectively and made the investments in the business that we believe are necessary to build the foundation for sustained long-term growth. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect to see continued foreign exchange headwinds from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q2 revenue of $3 million compared to Q1 and $22 million compared to Q2 of last year. As we guide for Q2, we are expecting another strong top-line quarter, with Q2 revenues in the range of $532 million to $547 million. This range represents 17% to 20% year-over-year growth adjusted for foreign exchange movements over a very strong second quarter last year, which included notable high-profile live events like the World Cup matches. At the high end of this guidance range, this growth rate is consistent with our Q1 growth rate, even with the full quarter wraparound effect of the Prolexic acquisition. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% to 78% and GAAP gross margins of approximately 67%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $200 million to $205 million, up from Q1 levels as the business absorbed a full quarter of the Octoshape and Xerocole acquisitions and as we continue to make head count and infrastructure investments across the business. Factoring in the various items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of 40% to 41%. And as I have been messaging, looking beyond Q2, we expect to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. However, EBITDA margins will be heavily dependent on revenue performance, possible M&A, increased platform capacity in anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services and continued foreign exchange movements. To provide some color on the foreign exchange point specifically, at current spot rates, we expect to see a negative impact on our EBITDA margin of one percentage point year-over-year. Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $64 million to $65 million, up from Q1 levels due to increases driven by our Q1 and planned Q2 network and facility build-outs, as well as the completion of several large software projects. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 28% to 29% for Q2. And with the overall revenue and expense configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.59. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $49 million to $52 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 33%, consistent with Q1 levels. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of roughly 181 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $108 million to $113 million in the quarter excluding equity compensation. The elevated levels of CapEx are primarily driven by our desire to increase our capacity to stay ahead of anticipated traffic growth on the network. For the full year, we are expecting to be at or slightly above the high end of our long-term model for CapEx as a percent of revenue, primarily driven by network expansion that we anticipate will continue throughout the year. Of course, the revenue benefit from network build-out tends to trail the expense by one to two quarters. In closing, we accomplished a great deal in Q1 and remain confident on our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. Now let me return the call back over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jim. It's great to see such a solid start for Akamai in 2015. Our financial performance attests to the soundness and sustainability of our business strategy. In Q1, we continued to make progress on the four grand challenges faced by our customers : delivering video over the Internet with high-quality, scale and affordability; providing near-instant performance for websites and apps on any device anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyber attacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data, or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to securely handle new cloud workloads with agility and affordability. At the recent National Association of Broadcasters Meeting in Las Vegas, I met with several of our large media customers to discuss their requirements for addressing the growing demand for over-the-top or OTT content. These broadcasters are looking to Akamai for delivery solutions that will meet their need for scale and affordability, as well as the expectations of online viewers for high quality. The potential for explosive growth in online video traffic presents Akamai with substantial opportunities, and it is the reason why we are continuing to invest in network build-out and media technology innovation. We recently closed the Octoshape acquisition, which is expected to augment our technological and operational capabilities to deliver a high-quality media to broadcast-size audiences. We believe that the Octoshape technology will further improve the quality and reliability of our live and linear streaming services, and that it will provide us with an end-to-end broadcast-over-IP service that aligns well with our media customers' roadmaps. Delivering high-quality video over the Internet at scale is much more complicated than most people realize. As broadcast TV moves online and IP subscription or pay-per-view models become mainstream, the expectation is that the quality and reliability of video delivery over the Internet will be comparable to that of traditional delivery mechanisms such as satellite and cable. This is very hard to achieve given that the Internet was not designed to handle such use cases at large scale. The multiplicity and rapidly expanding ecosystem of devices, operating systems, browsers, video players, encoders, DRM technologies, ad insertion methodologies, video formats, and carrier equipment make the problem even more challenging. If any component in the ecosystem has an incompatibility with another component or if any component gets overloaded, even for an instant, then there is the prospect of millions of end users suffering through a poor viewing experience. And this is just for the landline Internet. The problem gets harder still when we need to deal with the inherent capacity limitations of cellular networks. Cellular networks were designed to handle voice communications, which consume a factor of 100 to 1000 less bandwidth per user than video. The shift of mainstream viewing to IP has barely begun, and yet already, you can see reports of traditional delivery approaches failing to keep up with the increasing demands for quality and scale. When video gets congested at network peering points, the result is often degraded picture quality and painful re-buffering. Akamai's video delivery services are designed to manage all of these challenges for the world's leading broadcasters and content providers. Our unique approach of streaming content through servers in thousands of locations close to end users allows us to bypass congested peering points, resulting in a much better viewing experience for end users. And our large and very talented media R&D team is constantly working to ensure that our platform supports the myriad of devices, operating systems, browsers, video players, encoders, DRM technologies, ad insertion methodologies, video formats and carrier devices. Looking forward, we believe that the recent acquisition of Octoshape will further accelerate our efforts to develop and deploy the next generation of video delivery technology. The combination of Octoshape and organic Akamai capabilities positions us well in comparison to our competitors and do-it-yourself efforts when it comes to scaling and securing the Internet for our video customers. Our tremendous scale is achieved in part through close cooperation with the world's leading carriers. We locate our servers in over 1,350 networks, and we are forming much deeper relationships with the largest carriers. Today, I am very pleased to announce a new strategic partnership with China Unicom, one of the largest cloud computing service providers in China. Our partnership is with China Unicom's cloud division, which has agreed to complement its own cloud services with Akamai's full product suite of media delivery, Web performance and cloud security offerings. As you might imagine, we are seeing increased demand for delivering content to Chinese Internet users from global customers. Coupled with the agreement we signed last June with China Telecom, our new relationship with China Unicom allows us to improve the performance, scalability and cost effectiveness of our China CDN offering for our global customers. The vast scale and distributed nature of our platform also gives us significant advantages over the competition when it comes to security. Scale has become critical for security as typical attacks now contain tens or hundreds of gigabits per second of malicious traffic, more than enough to overcome the traditional defenses of even the most well-equipped data centers. Of course the need for security is not limited to our media customers. Enterprises across the board are concerned about the security of their Internet operations, and they are turning to Akamai for help. We believe that our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Routed Solutions are differentiated not only by their scale and sophistication, but also their ability to preserve performance in the face of large-scale attacks. Since launching Kona Site Defender three years ago, our quarterly revenue from all our security products has grown from near zero to over $55 million in the first quarter of 2015. Going forward, we plan to continue scaling our Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Routed businesses and we're also investing in the development of new security products. At the RSA conference last week, we introduced two new managed cloud security offerings, Managed Kona Site Defender and Kona DDoS Defender. These new offerings are designed to provide customers with 24x7 monitoring and attack support through Akamai's globally distributed security operation centers, or SOCs. Leveraging our cloud security intelligence and security experts at five locations worldwide, the Akamai SOCs provide an integrated security model that can help organizations respond to the latest attacks with shorter response times and higher mitigation quality. We're also working on the development of future Enterprise Security Solutions that will be designed to detect and prevent phishing, malware and data exfiltration attacks on corporate employees and infrastructure. The Xerocole acquisition that we closed in February provides a first step in this direction with their advanced recursive DNS technology. By combining our security intelligence with Xerocole technology, we are working on solutions that will block malicious entities at the DNS layer. There is much work still to be done, but we expect to have the first generation of our Enterprise Security Solutions in the market in 2016. In summary, 2015 is off to a strong start, and I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Akamai. We believe that our continued investments in product innovation, sales capacity, platform capabilities and overall scale are laying a solid foundation for our future growth. Thank you for your time today. Now, Jim and I will take your questions. Operator : The first question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich. Please proceed. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Good afternoon. You seem pretty excited about the potential for over-the-top. Could you \u2013 I know it's very early, could you size this potentially significant financially? And are these potential customers that you've not really done any business with before? Or have you been in maybe small parts of them and have a much bigger opportunity going forward? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. There's \u2013 as you may know, there's a lot of buzz right now about over-the-top and new video models emerging. This presents us with a lot of opportunity, and that's why we're increasing our investment in our media technologies and our platform scale. I think it's really hard to predict how much TV viewing will move over-the-top. The industry experts are trying to figure that out as well. And I think we'll have to see over the course of the next year just how big of an impact that is. Now as you know, we do a lot of business with most of the world's major broadcasters. And I think there's the opportunity to increase that business, and maybe in some cases, there'll be entities that don't do a lot of business with us, but the large majority of the world's major broadcasters already heavily use Akamai's services for their Internet content. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : And then, I also wanted to ask about the RSA conference. What was your experience there? And do you feel like you're getting some real traction and getting fairly well recognized as a security brand? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, I think we're actually making good progress there. Our revenues have grown dramatically. We have two products that are viewed as really very capable of defending against the large-scale DDoS and application layer attacks, and they're unique in their capabilities with both the scale and sophistication, but also the ability to preserve performance of websites and apps and data centers that are under attack. A lot of the traditional solutions just get swamped with the volume of today's traffic. And even when you engage them, performance degrades substantially. So I think we are getting to be more recognized as a security player; still a lot of work to do there, but we're making progress. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath. Please proceed. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Recently picked up coverage.... Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Vijay? Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. Recently picked up coverage on Akamai. A question I hear from our clients is, how do you channel-check this company? So give us some metrics and observation points to dig into, into the field to get a better sense of how the company is doing in cloud security, media delivery, web performance? What are the metrics we need to look into in the marketplace? That would be very helpful, thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, certainly, we've tried to provide a handful of information in our business. One, we're providing a breakout now of our security business, so you can see our security business is growing and compare that to other cloud security companies. We certainly provide how the media business is growing and some of our other businesses. I think one thing that you can look at \u2013 you can certainly \u2013 people can follow the news. And the first question around over-the-top is a good question. I think there's a lot going on relative to the grand challenges that Tom talks about. Video over IP at scale is but one. There's a lot of buzz, you're starting to see announcements from companies developing over-the-top programming content. That is kind of a proof point. Those \u2013 the big customers that not all of them, but many of them are Akamai customers that we're poised to benefit as more and more of video content moves online. So some of it is listening to what we're talking about, following the trends that we outline the business, and then I think following the general industry around what's happening in the media ecosystem. You can listen to other companies talk about where they're rapidly changing and evolving media ecosystem, hard to find companies that aren't talking about their concern about security and attacks. Certainly, we have solutions that can address some of them, not all of them, but we're certainly bolstering the portfolio with that. So I think you got to look at our portfolio, and you got to look at the industry and kind of what's going on. And I think we're providing proof points. We provide a little more content annually at our Investor Summit because we can provide \u2013 we have you there for several hours \u2013 and we're able to kind of go through it in more detail. So since you're new to covering Akamai, I would encourage you to go to the IR website and listen to a replay of that. And we'd be happy to have a follow-up conversation with you on anything else that you'd like to understand. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. And a quick follow-on if I may. Recently, we are hearing media reports of the major TV syndicates and the program producers following Netflix's lead, doing live streaming on the Internet \u2013 some using 4K video. Would that be potential business for Akamai, these major TV content producers doing live Internet streaming? Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, that is a potential business for Akamai. We are in that business today. We don't see many people streaming at 4K yet. We do support 4K, but we do see the quality levels increasing. So whereas a typical stream might have been done at a few megabits a second, now it's moving up towards 8 megabits a second or maybe a little bit more. But yeah, that's all potential business opportunity for Akamai, which is why we're investing in this area. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good luck. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Olson. Please proceed. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hey, good afternoon everybody. Just one question for me, could you update us on what percent of your customers are on an Akamai security solution today? And I guess what you think, it's probably hard to say, but what you think that penetration within your existing customer base could be, say, over the next three to five years? And then also, if you have it, what percent of customers using a security solution are also using another Akamai product or service? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So I think we have, I think, a little bit over 1,750 customers that are leveraging one of our security solutions. We have, roughly speaking, 5,400 customers. To your question around penetration, we actually think all customers could have the benefit of our security solutions. So our expectation is over the next three to five years, we certainly should be able to get \u2013 not that everyone is going to buy them, but I think that every single one of our customers, I think, is viable to covering one of our security solutions. And relative to customers that buy both security and other offerings, I would say that we still have customers that buy only security, especially those companies that came from Prolexic, so it's an upsell opportunity for us to sell them Web Performance Solutions. But in many cases, customers buy both Web Performance and Web Security. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): All right. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of James Breen. Please proceed. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple questions. Jim, one, on the currency side, you guys obviously had certain assumptions about currency when you gave guidance on the fourth quarter call. Just wondering how currency got worse throughout the first quarter. Just to get an apples-to-apples with where consensus was versus the number you reported. And then secondly, maybe for Tom on the strategy side, there's been a lot of talk about Level 3 and their agreement with Verizon in terms of sharing some of the CapEx on the interconnect side. Just wondering how you see that impacting. It seems like this would be beneficial to overall traffic, and just wondering how specifically it impacts Akamai. Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. On the Q1 FX versus our earnings guidance, I think we guided early February, it's about $1.5 million impact from the time of our earnings guidance to the end of the quarter. It was $3 million Q4 \u2013 I'm sorry, $7 million Q4 to Q1, but since our earnings guidance, it was about $1.5 million. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And on the second question, both Level 3 and Verizon resell Akamai services. They both have CDN efforts that compete with us, and I don't see any impact to their recent agreement on Akamai services. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. And then just one follow-up to that. You announced today or Rackspace announced that you guys were enlarging the relationship you have there. Could you just give us a little bit of color on that? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, this is enabling Rackspace users to have the benefit of Akamai content delivery services with a click. So it becomes very easy to use Akamai in the connection with Rackspace's Cloud. And as part of our effort in general, we're trying to make our services easier to use and more broadly accessible, and this is a great step in that direction. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe. Please proceed. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Maybe this is a question for Jim. I think when you had given the guidance for Q1 initially, one of the things you'd mentioned was that there was a number of larger contracts that had come up for renewal and would have a greater impact on Q1. To the extent that, though you've seen those contracts come up for renewal and now we're sort of seeing it in the numbers, I was just curious if there's any color there on how those renewals went and if there was anything notable in terms of the competitive dynamics in those renewals, pricing dynamics, anything on that front? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. That was a good question. You're right. We had guided in Q1 because the growth rates for media, we were projecting they grew at 23% in Q4, and we were signaling that they weren't going to probably grow at those growth rates because of, one, a very strong Q4 on the traffic side; and, two, we were having a few more large customers renew in Q1 than normal. But the renewal process, you're right, it's embedded in the results and the renewals came out as expected, so nothing notable as far as it being kind of better or worse. They were as expected. And we're pretty bullish on 16% revenue growth, off of what we think was a pretty tough compare for Q1 of 2014. As you recall, in Q1 of 2014, we had a lot of large gaming and software releases. We also had the benefit of the Sochi Olympics. So for the business to grow at 16% with kind of that activity going on, we're pretty pleased. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And then just one more from me. I noticed that a couple weeks ago, there was some news out of you all about some leadership changes and some hires that you made in APJ. Just wondered if there was \u2013 clearly, you mentioned all geographies did well in the quarter, but just curious what sort of precipitated the additional hiring or additional focus of leadership in Asia. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we see tremendous potential for growth in APJ. You have a lot of the world's most important companies there. The majority of the world's population is there, a lot of end users coming online, so a lot of potential growth for us, and we are building out our strengths and experience and our management team there. And so that's why you would see those announcements. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini. Please proceed. Unknown Speaker : Hi. Thanks. This is Shateel Alam (37:30) filling in for Heather. Sorry, I didn't know the carrier reseller. I guess did the momentum with carrier resellers continue this quarter? Is there any indication that this channel will kind of see similar growth to what occurred last year? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we had very strong growth in our carrier channel again. It's our strongest kind of growing component of our channel business. I don't think it's going to grow at the rates that we saw in 2014. One of the things that we had mentioned last year was Q4 \u2013 2014 had a little bit of the benefit for a couple of large channel partners. We were ceding them with some business that was with Akamai Direct that we transitioned to them. It's really helped bootstrap their business going forward. So we had a little bit of higher growth rates in 2014, but very, very strong growth rates in Q1, and again, the fastest-growing component of our channel business. Unknown Speaker : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Turits. Please proceed. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good evening. Obviously, as you pointed out, 16% constant currency growth in media, often tough comps when you look at renewal. Any thoughts \u2013 is that kind of a decent enough baseline assumption of mid-teens growth on a real basis, even though we don't have tough comp? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Are you talking about going forward, Michael? Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I mean I think as we talked about that the media business can have variability from quarter to quarter because of gaming releases, software updates, things of that nature. But I think what we've said consistently is, we expect the business to grow in the mid-teens kind of on an ongoing basis. There's going to be some quarters and some years, it grows well north of that. There'll be some quarters and some years where it grows a little bit less than that. But we believe it's going to be a strong mid-teens grower kind of long term. And I would say that, again, some period, it's going to be faster than that, some period, it's going to be lower than that. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. And then on the P&S side, so Security looked really strong, right, $55 million I think after you did $140 million and change for all of last year. So it looks like a big acceleration even 4Q to 1Q. How is the rest of the Performance business because if you backed the Security out, then that growth looked significantly slower? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I mean if you just do the math on it, you know, kind of in that Performance and Security category that the other non-security businesses grew about 14%, which is consistent with what they grew in Q4, again, pretty solid growth that, as you can imagine, the Security is the new offering for the company. It's been a new offering for a while. I think with the Prolexic acquisition, there's been a lot of training and, I would say, focus from the sales force for selling security. And one of the things I had shared is that in addition, as we've been building out the sales force, the sales force also sells media. And so, I think what you're seeing is that the sales force sells the myriad of our solutions. I think we're seeing a little bit stronger growth in media and certainly in security. I think the Web performance growth rates are pretty good, but I think that certainly the Web performance growth rates, I think, are being impacted by maybe the focus more on the security space for now. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow. Please proceed. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil. Just looking into your gross margin, this was slightly down from Q4, but in line with what you guided. You talked about earlier all the network optimization and grooming that you have been doing. Just wondering if you could give some color in terms of color in terms of collocation and bandwidth expenses that you are seeing this quarter and how should we think about going forward? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I mean we're very pleased with the gross margin performance. I think what tends to happen sometimes in Q4, Q4s tend to be seasonally our strongest revenue quarters, and so sometimes you tend to see margins uptick. Last year, we had gross margins of around 78%. I think we're probably going to have gross margins in the 77% to 78%. We're not that tight within a point. So we're very pleased, as you can imagine, that we've been building out more on the platform. We built more out in Q4. We built more out in Q1. We're signaling we got to do more in Q2. You can expect that when we're doing that, we're increasing in particular collocation costs for that build-out. We're seeing bandwidth costs that obviously increase with the level of traffic growth. But if you look at it in aggregate, having gross margins of 77% to 78%, we're very pleased with that. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And one follow-up on the CapEx. Last quarter, you talked about CapEx guidance. You were higher than what you guided, but you were expecting 2015 guidance to be in line with like around 16%. But now, you're expecting now up on the high-end of your long-term guidance. What has really changed in between, and what's really driving CapEx at this point? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, well, to be clear, we were a little bit lighter in Q1. We didn't signal in Q1 that were going to be kind of at 16% in revenue for the year. Our range is 16% to 18%. And what I'm saying is that, I think we're going that 18% or maybe a little bit higher than that. And I think what we're seeing is we're signaling that we are doing more network build-out. We did some in Q1. We're going to do more in Q2. And you can expect that that is in anticipation of traffic demand. And there is a lag between building out the network and monetizing it from a revenue perspective. The lag tends to be maybe a quarter or two. And what we want to make sure we're doing is we want to make sure we're building up the network to support the most aggressive traffic growth expectations. And we have found that if those traffic growth expectations don't materialize, we grow into it in the following quarter. So it's a low-risk proposition for us. And what we're doing is we're building out for what we think is going to be traffic growth in the back half of the year and we'll see if that occurs, but if it's a little bit less than what we expect, we'll just dial back CapEx thereafter. So I think you're going to see us go through a period of increased network build-out. And I think you should view that as a bullish sign from the company around what we think is opportunity ahead. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty. Please proceed. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Jim, I think you just answered my question with that last comment, but I'm going to ask it anyway. Media was the big driver relative to people's expectations last year. You mentioned in the first quarter you didn't have the gaming updates, the software updates and the Olympics. So I was going to ask is growth kind of tapped out here in terms of that side of the business and even maybe even in Security and Performance and what are going to be the incremental drivers to maybe drive a re-acceleration on a constant currency basis off of what we saw, especially on the media side? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, I think you heard the tail end of it that we're \u2013 actually, we're quite bullish on all the businesses. But media in particular, the traffic build-out that we're signaling is we're definitely signaling some bullishness that we have on the traffic side. We'll see, again. As I said, we build out in anticipation of what we think is an aggressive traffic demand so that we're there for our customers should they need us. If we fall a little bit short of that, it will be just a quarter thereafter that we kind of lower our cap expectations. But we are very bullish about the prospects for security. So I think you're going to see continued growth in the security space. There's a lot of opportunity as well with Web performance. We're not nearly penetrated on Web performance with customers that, in particular in the international markets, there's a lot more opportunity. Certainly have opportunities in the U.S. as well, but we're pretty bullish on all the areas that \u2013 I think there's secular tailwinds for the company both in media, with more content moving online. I think there's opportunities in security and there's opportunities in Web performance. I think what you're seeing us do is we're investing to capitalize on those opportunities. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : But for the second half that you made the comment on specifically, is it winning more customers? Is it more content from existing customers? What specifically is that driver that you're building out ahead of? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I'm not going to provide guidance beyond the second quarter. I did signal kind of just so that people have an awareness of where we're heading so that it is not a surprise. I think you can expect that it's a combination of both. It's customers that we currently have and it's customers that we expect may move to the Akamai platform and that's what we're bullish about. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of than a Sameet Sinha. Please proceed. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hello? Operator : It appears that question was cleared from queue. The next question will come from Gray Powell. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had a couple, if I may. How should we think about the EBITDA and operating margin profile in your security business this year given that it's growing substantially higher than the company average and the investments you're making? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We don't disclose the EBITDA and operating margin of each one of the individual businesses. I think you can expect that the security business is in early-stage growth where we're investing more rapidly than we're seeing in revenue growth, so you can certainly see the security business is early-stage. And you can expect that we're going to continue to invest in that. We're going to invest in build-out of the network to support what we think is growing demand there. We're going to invest in more security engineering capability, more security sales capability. So we're going to continue to invest in \u2013 it's certainly one of the areas of significant investment for the company. It probably is worthy to note beyond security though, your comment about EBITDA, because I'm sure it's going to come up as a question, so I'm guiding 40% to 41%. I know we've joked about it on other calls, that I've been signaling this for a while. This is certainly something that we're guiding here for Q2. And I certainly signaled that that is the intent of the company to operate in the 40% to 41% range in the foreseeable future. I did outline a few areas. Obviously, M&A is a variable that may affect EBITDA margins longer-term, depending upon M&A activity that \u2013 whatever that company's profile is. Foreign exchange, depending upon what happens with foreign exchange, we have a little bit of a natural hedge, but it's certainly, as I mentioned, it's EBITDA erosion. So if foreign exchange continues to see the dollar strengthen, that will obviously have an impact on EBITDA margins, that is somewhat out of our control. And I'd say a third area is, we signaled more network build-out. I would say if we start to see a \u2013 maybe an inflection point and the need for us to build out faster to support our customers, we will do that. And that may have an impact on EBITDA margins. So those are things I would say, as I sit here right now, I think we're going to operate in the 40% to 41% range. But those are variables that could affect it, higher or lower. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. Got it. I guess maybe the point I was trying to get at and it's not really a 12-month or 18-month question, but at some point, it's probably fair to assume that your security business is not going to have this, like, hyperbolic growth rate that'll kind of slow down and be more like in line with the company average. And then when that happens, do the margins in the security business tick higher and that naturally give you some kind of a benefit down the road? That makes sense? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think you can expect that the maturity business scales that the growth rates will slow from, let's face it, we've had growth rates over 100%, some of it benefiting from the Prolexic acquisition. But certainly, yeah I think you can expect in the near term, it's going to grow well north of the company average because even with the Prolexic acquisition anniversary occurring, but our expectation again, we've talked about the company model that our desire and ambition is to grow to $5 billion by the end of 2020. It requires a 17% growth rate. We think that there is opportunity for 17% growth rate really in all of our businesses. I think media has that opportunity to grow like that. I think the performance businesses have that opportunity; I think security does. So, I think there are a lot of \u2013 each one of our businesses individually have a lot of room left to grow. So, even though security growth rates, certainly once you go through an anniversary will slow, I think you can inspect that we are not nearly tapped out as far as opportunity in that space. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Understood. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee. Please proceed. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. Thank you. A couple questions, guys. First, I guess with the commentary about China Unicom just gets me down the path of the focus in APAC with some of these new relationships, does that meaningfully influence the CapEx outlook? Namely, is the CapEx increase in particular geographically focused? And then the \u2013 my second question was around security, and if you could just give us a sense of where you think the core technologies that you plan to add to the portfolio are going to come from? I mean, obviously, there's going to be some organic, some acquired, but you believe \u2013 what would be the predominant sort of the bulk of the newer technologies there? Where would they be likely to come from, either the acquired side or the homegrown? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. As we develop major new carrier relationships, typically that will be followed with some CapEx deployment to take advantage of those relationships. I don't think any one in particular as a big swing per se, so I wouldn't worry about that in particular. Obviously, China is a very important market, and so we are going to be working on the relationships there and expanding deployments. In terms of security, we develop a lot of the core technologies ourselves. We also look at partnerships. And as you know, M&A, we did acquire Prolexic last year. As I talked about earlier today, we acquired Xerocole. Now, Xerocole, I don't think was positioned as a security company with their recursive DNS technology, but that is an important component, technology component for us as we develop our Enterprise Security Solutions that we plan to bring to market next year. So as we go forward, you can expect sort of more of the same that way. There'll be a lot of organic development. There'll be partnerships. And potentially, we're always looking for companies that have good technology that we can bring to bear for the benefit of our customers. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. If I could, just one last quick one. On the Enterprise side, I didn't hear any update along the front of Cisco and more of a, I guess, a general enterprise update. So can you give us just a sense of the penetration success there relative to expectations thus far? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Cisco is still in the early stages, so there has been customer adoption. There's a strong pipeline. I don't expect material impact on our revenues this year to Cisco \u2013 with the Cisco relationship, but there's a good road map in place and we hope that there'll be success in the marketplace that will start to really have a help to us in 2016. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael. Please proceed. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Can you guys hear me? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We can. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Just wanted to go back to the two transactions that you made, the one in the first quarter and the one that just closed in the second quarter. I realize that they're small, but I was wondering if you can give us any financial detail in terms of were they generating revenue, and to the extent they are, I would assume dilutive to margins. If you can give any color because it does seem when I look at your second quarter guidance that your revenue is basically in line with expectations. Your margins are a little bit softer than anticipated. I'm just curious how much of that might have to do with the M&A. And then by second question, and it goes back to I guess what Gray was asking as it relates to EBITDA margins. I think you've historically said \u2013 not historically, but in your Analyst Day, set expectations on a go-forward basis for 40% to 42%. You're now saying 40%, 41%. I appreciate FX is a 100 basis point impact at least in 2015. But as we go into those outer years, would you expect that the margins do continue to kind of creep back up toward that 42%? Just trying to get a little color there. Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. On the M&A front, both Xerocole and Octoshape had very little revenue. That was really not the purpose of those acquisitions. Those were kind of technology acquisitions and people-related acquisitions. They were quite \u2013 they had a little bit of revenue, but I would say not material to even comment on. I think we commented in the press release. Both copies combined had roughly 50 employees. So just do general math on that, you can probably \u2013 it's probably a $3 million sequential increase, $3 million to $4 million on spending. They certainly didn't have, obviously, the margin profile that Akamai does. So they're slightly dilutive, not very material, but slightly dilutive to Akamai. And on the EBITDA front, I'm not moving off the 40% to 42%; 40% to 42% is our long-term model. What I'm suggesting to you is that we're going through a period here where we're probably going to be operating the company at the lower end of that. And some of that, I think, is based on some upon some investments that we think are going to pay dividend. You know, one of the areas that we talked about is we are doing a little bit more in the way of network build-out, and so I think that is going to pressure EBITDA margins in the near term. And we probably shouldn't dwell too, too much on EBITDA margins by themselves because I think you need to look at the financial model of the company in aggregate that if our media business starts to explode on revenue and it has an impact on EBITDA margins, I'm not going to be unhappy with that. I mean, that's a business mix phenomenon that we'll deal with that \u2013 and so I think we just want to make sure that we're agile in responding to what we believe is traffic demand. And that's really what we're doing. And I think what I'm signaling is that we're probably going to operate at the lower end of our kind of range. And we'll see what happens as far as kind of the ecosystem for media. We'll see what happens with the overall macroeconomic environment with foreign exchange. And we'll see what happens relative to M&A for the company. But I would say based on what I shared at the Investor Summit, I do believe that is the right long-term model for the company. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell. Please proceed. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Hi. This is Rishi Jaluria dialing in for Greg McDowell. Thank you for taking my questions. Two quick ones. So you broke out the security business separately this quarter, which is very helpful. Do you anticipate that we'll see any seasonality in this business that we see with the company as a whole? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't know if you'll really see seasonality. I think what you might see in the security business sometimes is that because there can be very high-profile attacks that you read about in the media, sometimes when that happens, you do see an uptick in our security business because customers need to be protected immediately, and they'll turn to us to help them immediately. So you might see some, I wouldn't call it seasonality, but you might see an uptick if in fact you start to see some significant high-profile media events that occur. But I think in general, it's a subscription revenue business, and that's the way it will operate. It doesn't necessarily have spikes based on traffic usage or things of that nature. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then just one quick follow-up. You talked about FX headwinds on revenue for the quarter. I was just wondering if you could tell us what sort of impact did FX headwinds have on Q1 in terms of EBITDA and EPS. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, you can think that, as I mentioned, it's about a one point EBITDA impact year-on-year. So you can have a general flavor of what the flow-through is of that. Our EBITDA is 40% to 41%. The flow-through is probably closer \u2013 on the FX line is closer to 50%. So you can take that $22 million that I mentioned and then you're probably going to see an $11 million flow-through from a foreign exchange perspective. And obviously, that will flow through to earnings as well. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire. Please proceed. Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. I just got a question about the over-the-top opportunity, whether that involves a new set of customers and new relationships. I mean, are they \u2013 is the growth and opportunity that you see coming from existing customers, or are you expanding? Does this expand actually your base of customers that are going to be doing a lot of business with you? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it has the potential for both. But as we talked about previously, the large majority of the world's major broadcasters are already sizable Akamai customers. So I think probably a lot of it is from customers that exist with us today, but would be doing new things with us as they move TV content over-the-top. Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Great. And just regarding hiring, which I think that slipped a bit from Q1, could you provide a bit of color on where you're investing at least in field sales and how you expect your hiring plans to track throughout the year? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we added about a little over 300 people in the quarter. We've been hiring \u2013 you're right. We've been hiring in sales, we've been hiring in services, we've been hiring in engineering. So hiring has been pretty pervasive in the company, and it's focused in kind of two specific areas. One, it's hiring to enable us to grow and it's also hiring to enable us to scale as a company. So we're hiring in all those areas. And you can expect that we're going to continue to hire throughout the year. I think you're probably going to see us hiring and our spending maybe grow more in line with revenue growth, kind of longer term, but we have been going through a period of hiring and spending, growing faster than revenue. That will kind of continue for a kind of short period of time. But I think that they're going to see it level off and grow more in line with revenue. Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha. Please proceed. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. It's been about six months since you launched the newer versions of Ion product to your sales team. Can you talk about the penetration there and the opportunity? I know you kind of indicated that the focus is more on security solutions, but in terms of the adoption rate? Second question would be in terms of mobile. What sort of strategies or technology approaches are you pursuing and which of them do you think will come out the winner? Do you have any initial sense of which one you would adopt? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. So we've had good adoption on the new Ion product line. As you know, there's Ion Standard, which is really focused on excellent performance, ease of use, and on the mobile environment. Ion is all about providing excellent performance in a variety of use cases, where the user may be and how they're connecting and what device they're using. And then Ion Premier, which is really the ultimate, all the technologies we have designed to make a really fast and reliable experience for the end user. There's a lot of mobile technologies that we are developing. In fact, if you look at the Investor Summit presentations, we list several of them and talk about them there, so you can get a lot more technical detail, but things : front-end optimization, adaptive image compression, the Shadow Protocol, which we developed for decreasing the frequency of communications of mobile devices and suppressing the headers, so less back-and-forth there. So, there's a variety of things we do to try to optimize the experience and get around the inherent bottleneck of lack of capacity and high latencies in cellular environments. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Okay. Well, thank you, operator. And in closing, a number of our executives will be presenting at investor conferences in May and June. The details of those can be found in the Investor Relations section at Akamai.com. We want to thank you for joining us and have a wonderful evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Welcome to the Q2 2015 Akamai Technologies Inc. earnings conference call. My name is Steven, and I will be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Thank you, Steven, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represents the company's view on July 28, 2015. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tom, and thank you for joining us today. Akamai delivered a solid second quarter, with strong revenue growth across all of our geographies and in all of our solution categories, with particularly strong growth coming from our cloud security offerings. Revenue in the second quarter was $541 million, up 14% year over year and up 18% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $0.57 per diluted share, down 2% year over year but up 3% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. I'll be back in a few minutes to talk more about the progress that we made during the second quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead. But first, let me turn the call over to Jim for our detailed financial results and the outlook for Q3. Jim? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom just highlighted, Akamai performed well in the second quarter. Q2 revenue came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range at $541 million, up 14% year over year or up 18% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds, with strong and balanced growth across the entire business. Media revenue was $244 million in the quarter, up 12% year over year or up 17% on a constant currency basis. These growth rates are particularly strong when you consider our very strong Q2 of 2014, which benefited from several large gaming releases and the World Cup matches. As I've mentioned on past earnings call, where we land in our revenue guidance range is heavily influenced by media traffic, and Q2 traffic came in at the midpoint of our expectations. Turning now to our Performance and Security Solutions, revenue was $256 million in the quarter, up 15% year over year or up 19% on a constant currency basis. Within the solution category, we saw solid growth across most of the product lines. And as Tom mentioned, we continued to see strong growth in demand for our cloud security offerings. Second quarter revenue for our cloud security solutions was $61 million, up 39% year over year or up 44% on a constant currency basis. We are pleased with our continued growth and market recognition of our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities. We have grown our security business from just a few million dollars in 2011 to over $210 million over the past 12 months. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $41 million in the quarter, up 14% year over year or up 18% on a constant currency basis. We continued to see improvements in new customer attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise-class professional services as well as service offering upgrades into the installed base. Turning now to our geographies, revenue growth continued to be solid across all of our major geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 26% of total revenue in Q2, consistent with the prior quarter. International revenue was $142 million in the quarter, up 7% year over year or up 22% on a constant currency basis. The stronger dollar continued to weigh on growth rates and had a negative impact on revenue of $21 million on a year-over-year basis and $1 million on a sequential basis. On a constant currency basis, we saw solid growth in both our Asia-Pacific and EMEA markets. Revenue from our U.S. market was $399 million, up 16% year over year, with solid growth across all solution categories. And finally, revenue through channel partners represented 27% of total revenue in Q2, up one point sequentially. Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, down one point from the prior quarter and the same period last year and coming in at the lower end of our guidance range, given both the revenue results and the increased investment in network expansion in the quarter. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, down one point from the prior quarter and down two points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $255 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $204 million, at the upper end of our guidance and up $15 million from the prior quarter as we absorbed a full quarter of the Octoshape and Xerocole acquisitions and continue to make head count and infrastructure investments across the business, with the goal of driving both growth and scale. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $214 million, down $9 million from Q1 levels and down $10 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down two points from Q1 levels and down three points from the same period last year and coming in at the low end of our guidance range given our revenue and gross margin configuration. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $74 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $64 million, up $3 million from Q1 levels and in line with guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $150 million, down $12 million from Q1 and down $5 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28%, down three points from Q1 levels and down five points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the second quarter was roughly $3 million, down slightly from Q1 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million, also consistent with Q1 levels. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the second quarter was $67 million or $0.37 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $102 million or $0.57 of earnings per diluted share and coming in at the midpoint of our guidance range. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $35 million based on an effective tax rate of 34.5%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million, based on an effective tax rate of 32.5%, slightly lower than our guidance due to a revised full-year 2015 tax rate projection that reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 181 million shares, consistent with Q1 levels and in line with our guidance. Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the second quarter was 59 days, consistent with Q1 levels and down one day from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $107 million, slightly below the low end of our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to some planned network capacity investments shifting into Q3. As a reminder, this CapEx number includes capitalized software development activities. Cash flow generation was strong in the second quarter, with free cash flow of $168 million or 31% of revenue. During the quarter we spent $63 million on share repurchases, buying just over 850,000 shares at an average price of $74. At the end of Q2, we had $308 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet also remains very strong, with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $835 million. As we've discussed the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times. As always, our overall goal is to deploy our capital in a manner we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. In summary, we executed well and in line with our expectations in Q2. We delivered solid revenue growth and made the investments in the business that we believe are necessary to build a foundation for sustained long-term growth and scale. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect continued foreign exchange headwinds to weigh on growth rates. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q3 revenue of about $2 million compared to Q2, and $20 million compared to Q3 of last year. In addition to currency headwinds, we anticipate a moderation in media growth rates for Q3. As we have discussed in the past, traffic volumes can vary from one quarter to the next given the size and timing of software releases as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities. And as you will recall, our very strong Q3 results last year were driven by unseasonably strong traffic and revenue growth, with our largest and most strategic social media, gaming, and software download customers in particular. We are not expecting that same level of traffic volume uptick in this Q3, and anticipate traffic patterns consistent with what we've seen seasonally during the mid-summer months, specifically lower traffic volumes as people spend less time on the Internet. And while we expect a moderation in media growth rates this quarter, we remain bullish on the longer-term secular trends for this business going forward. Factoring in both of these items, we are expecting Q3 revenue in the range of $543 million to $555 million. This range represents 13% to 15% growth adjusted for foreign exchange movements over an exceptionally strong Q3 of last year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% to 78% and GAAP gross margins of approximately 67%. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $205 million to $210 million, up slightly from Q2 levels. Factoring in the various items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins of 40%. And as I have been messaging, looking beyond Q3, we expect to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. However, to be transparent, EBITDA margins will be heavily dependent on several factors, including revenue volumes, possible M&A, spending on platform capacity in anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services, and foreign exchange movements. Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $66 million to $67 million, up from Q2 levels, driven by our first half and planned Q3 network build-outs and the completion of several large software projects. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 27% to 28% in Q3. And with the overall revenue expense configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.58. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $49 million to $51 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of roughly 33%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $95 million to $105 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. The elevated levels of CapEx this year are driven by our desire to increase our capacity to stay ahead of anticipated traffic growth on the network. For the full year, we are expecting to be slightly above the high end of our long-term model for CapEx as a percent of revenue. Because the revenue benefit from our network build-outs tends to trail the investment, our margins are expected to be slightly pressured in the near term, but we believe it is the right business decision to build out now to ensure that capacity is available to support the potential for significant growth in online video traffic in 2016 and beyond. In closing, we delivered another solid quarter and first half of 2015, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. Now let me turn the call back over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jim. It's great to see Akamai building on our strong start to the year, and I'm very optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. We believe that our solid financial performance is evidence of the sound fundamentals in our business strategy and the pivotal role that we play in the growth of the Internet. We continue to provide unique value by focusing on solving four grand challenges for our customers : delivering video over the Internet with unsurpassed quality, scale, and affordability; providing near-instant performance for websites and apps on any device anywhere; protecting websites and data centers from cyberattacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data, or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to handle new cloud workloads with high performance and low cost. End users today expect to be able to consume any content anywhere, anytime, on any device, and they expect their online experience to be fast, reliable, and secure. If they're watching a video, then the picture needs to have high resolution and never rebuffer. In response, the world's major broadcasters and Internet companies are working to create over-the-top, or OTT, services and packages for popular video content. This has the potential to create an enormous amount of traffic on the Internet. Typical subscribers watching OTT video delivered across the Akamai platform could consume 10 megabits per second or more of traffic while they're watching. This means that an audience size of only 5 million users, which is the equivalent of about four Nielsen points, could generate 50 terabits per second of demand, far more than we deliver today for all of our customers combined. And if OTT becomes commonplace, the demand could increase by an order of magnitude or more. This is why we are investing in growing the capacity of our platform and why we are working on new technologies to decrease the cost of delivering large volumes of video. But making OTT successful involves a lot more than just capacity and scale. The quality of the viewing experience is also critically important. Delivering broadcast quality video over the Internet at scale is a lot harder than most people realize, especially considering the diversity of video formats, devices, operating systems, browsers, video players, DRM and ad insertion technologies, encoders, and carrier equipment in the ecosystem. And that's just for the landline Internet. The problem is even harder when you try to deliver high-quality video over cellular networks. That's because cellular networks were originally built for voice, and voice uses about 1,000 times less capacity then video. Akamai's video delivery solutions are designed to manage all the challenges of delivering OTT content for the world's leading broadcasters, content providers, and major Internet companies. Our unique approach of streaming content through servers in thousands of locations close to end users allows us to bypass congested peering points, resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users. Our superior communication and video transport protocols are designed to enable a higher-quality picture, which is increasingly demanded by users and broadcasters alike. And our highly talented media R&D team is constantly working to ensure that our platform has the scale, quality, and affordability needed for OTT to become widely adopted. We also believe that we are making good progress with integrating Octoshape's streaming optimization technology into our next generation of video delivery solutions, and we are confident that our combined capabilities and scale will differentiate Akamai from our many competitors and do-it-yourself efforts. Akamai's unique global scale is achieved by partnering with the world's leading carriers. Just last week, we were very pleased to announce our new strategic partnership with Telecom Italia. As a result of this partnership, Telecom Italia will now be offering Akamai's full suite of services within the Italian market, including video delivery, web acceleration, and security. Overall, Akamai has more than 1,400 network partners, and we have about 190,000 servers in thousands of locations across 111 countries. Of course, the scale of our globally distributed platform offers significant advantages over the competition and do-it-yourself efforts when it comes to delivering large volumes of content quickly and reliably. It also provides significant advantages in defending websites against cyberattacks. In the past year alone, the number of DDoS attacks mitigated by Akamai has increased by more than 130%. Today, we are defending many of the world's leading brands against attacks that typically flood their sites with many tens of gigabits per second of malicious traffic, and the largest attacks now contain several hundred gigabits per second of traffic. These volumes are more than enough to overwhelm traditional security defenses in most any enterprise, and that is why so many enterprises are turning to Akamai for their web security needs. Our flagship security solutions, Kona Site Defender and Prolexic, are differentiated by their scale, their sophistication, and their ability to sustain performance in the face of such large-scale attacks. Over the past three years, we have grown our quarterly security revenue from $4 million when we first launched Kona Site Defender to $61 million in Q2. We were particularly pleased to see our security business grow 44% over Q2 of last year, the first quarter that included the full benefit of the Prolexic acquisition. As a result, Akamai is now one of the few cloud-based security companies with an annual revenue run rate of more than $200 million. Our growth has not gone unnoticed in the marketplace, and our security services are now being recognized by the leading independent research firms. In the last month, both Forrester and Gartner published research reports on the cybersecurity landscape that included Akamai. Forrester identified Akamai as a leader among DDoS service providers and scored Akamai as the top company in the strategy and market presence categories. Gartner cited Akamai's differentiated WAF [Web Application Firewall]-as-a-cloud service solution and made us one of only a few companies to move up and to the right in their Magic Quadrant. In addition, Gartner stated that by 2020, more than 60% of web apps will use WAF delivered from the cloud, up from less than 15% today, which we believe speaks to the large opportunity ahead for Akamai's security business. Since cybersecurity is so vital to our customers, we are continuing to invest in the development of new and more capable security solutions. In May we launched our first Client Reputation service. Leveraging behavioral analytics and the huge volume of web traffic that Akamai handles every day, our new Client Reputation service identifies IP addresses that have attacked or abused customer websites. Customers are able to alert or block the identified malicious users based on a risk score derived from the history of their past actions. Client Reputation is designed to complement and extend the protection provided by Kona Site Defender by blocking traffic from users that have attacked any Akamai customer within the past 45 days. Initial customer reaction to this new services been very positive, with numerous customers purchasing the service in Q2. We are also developing a suite of enterprise security solutions to detect and prevent phishing, malware, and data exfiltration attacks against enterprises. We expect the advanced recursive DNS technology that we acquired with Xerocole in February to play a significant role in these offerings, which we anticipate introducing into the market in 2016. In summary, Akamai is off to a very solid start in the first half of 2015, and I'm very excited about the opportunities for growth that lie ahead. Thank you for your time today. Now Jim and I will take your questions. Operator : Stand by for your first question, which comes from the line of Gray Powell from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, thanks for putting me up early in the lineup. I appreciate it. So maybe to start, what is your view on the rate and pace of over-the-top offerings? Do you see a point in time over the next six to 12 months when it has more of a direct or potentially accelerated impact on your business? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's really hard to predict the rate of adoption and when new OTT services will become available. But we are in conversations with the country's leading broadcasters, in fact, several global broadcasters and major Internet companies, and there's a lot of buzz out there and a lot of interest in bringing major video content online over-the-top. And that's already starting to have an impact on our financials in the sense that we're buying more CapEx and you see us be a little bit above our long-term plan in CapEx this year. And as we put that CapEx into co-lo and get it connected with bandwidth, there's some cost there. And we want to be in the position of being prepared. There is the possibility that it could have a significant impact on our financials next year. We are taking risk in doing this because there's always a chance that the offerings will be delayed or there won't be as much uptake among the users and subscribers as people are hoping for, but we're willing to take that risk. The downside there is that if we just deploy the CapEx a little early we'll be using it within a year anyway, but we really want to be ready if OTT takes off as a lot of people think it might. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it, and then just one more on the cost side, if I may. So I understand that the EBITDA margin target remains in the 40% to 41% range. Can you help us think through the components there? I think that your new sales reps, that continues to grow at the same pace that you've seen over the last couple of years. Productivity should scale. I would assume the Prolexic margin should be improving. Can you just help us think through some of these incremental investments in the line items to keep margins at current levels? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'll take that. So as you can imagine, with the network CapEx build-outs that Tom referenced, that's going to pressure margins in the near term, in particular gross margins, but obviously that affects EBITDA as well. We think it's the right business decision, so you can expect that \u2013 last year I think we ended at 79% gross margin in Q4. Obviously we were at 77% in Q2. We will probably be in the 77% to 78% range for the foreseeable future. But we still plan to manage the company at the 40% to 41% level, which tells you we are going to continue to make investments in the business, across the business. We're going to continue to make investments in all the areas that we have been talking about. We'll continue to make investments in R&D. We'll continue to make investments in platform capacity. We'll continue to make investments in go-to-market. But we'll obviously be mindful of those investments and managing these investments within the context of the fact that we're doing pretty substantial build-outs now on the network side. So we are certainly mindful of that, but you can expect that we'll continue to make investments. And as I mentioned, for the foreseeable future, we expect to be in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range, but that does depend upon the things that I mentioned. It depends upon what happens with revenue volumes. It depends upon if there's an M&A that we think is opportunistic and the right decision for the company that that may be altered. But we're telling you what we see right now. And if we execute the plan that we currently have, I think that we can operate in those levels. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Understood, okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys, one question and one follow-up. First on the OTT opportunity, I wasn't quite clear. Is this an expectation of closing incremental new customers to drive that growth or is it that you expect your existing customers to drive additional volume, or is it a combination? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the majority of it would be a substantial increase from existing customers. Today we already service pretty much all the major broadcasters. And as they bring content over-the-top, that would be traffic that would make sense to put on the Akamai platform. And in some cases, you have the big Internet companies out there maybe offering bundles and packages, and pretty much they are already Akamai customers. It would be a new service for them potentially, but most of the major media brands already use Akamai. So I think less of new customers, more of new service and substantially increased traffic from our existing customer base. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, and then the one follow-up. If I heard you correctly in your prepared remarks, it sounds like the guidance here on revenue for the September quarter incorporates not only the tough compare but maybe some moving around of timing of major software releases, et cetera. Can you help clarify in terms of \u2013 while you're not guiding for December, how should we think about the seasonal sequential growth in the back half of this year versus what you've seen in previous years? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'll take that. I'm certainly not going to guide for Q4. But to give you little more color on Q3, as you mentioned, and you've followed the company for a while, we had a very, very strong media quarter last Q3. The media business last Q3 grew 7% from Q2 to Q3. It's never grown at those rates. Admittedly, we've told you that traffic volumes vary from quarter to quarter. Sometimes you get big gaming releases. Sometimes you get big software updates. Sometimes there's an introduction of new capabilities on social media platforms. And so that really affects traffic volumes. And so certainly for Q3, we're not expecting those same level of volumes that we saw last year. It's probably less the timing of a big software release because I don't think that it's necessarily just the timing of the releases; it's also the size of those releases. And so there's a bunch of factors that we've outlined in our Q3 guidance. I really would hesitate to give you Q4 guidance because a lot of things can happen in Q4 because of the holiday season. It's seasonally our biggest quarter, and we usually provide fairly wide ranges of revenue guidance in that quarter because it can be heavily influenced by holiday seasonality. But for the third quarter, you can expect the media business is certainly going to moderate because we expect traffic volumes. And to be clear, because someone is probably going to ask me this question, well is it related to some big renewal of a large customer? It's not driven by renewals of large customers. This is just driven by an expectation that traffic volumes are going to be more seasonally light, which is what we tend to see in Q3, and we haven't seen that in the last couple sequential quarters for Q2 to Q3. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Steve Milunovich from UBS. Please go ahead. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Could you go a bit deeper into the year-over-year decline in gross margin? How much of that comes from incremental depreciation associated with CapEx? Are there other factors? What are you seeing in pricing and so forth? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, so year-over-year GAAP gross margins were down two points. Cash gross margins were down I think about a point. Certainly a point of that is depreciation. And as we mentioned, we've been doing some pretty substantive build-out of the network, so you can account for half of that. And as you can imagine, we've been doing very large build-out in the first half. And so as you deploy CapEx onto the network, you end up having a fair amount of incremental cost to actually get that CapEx deployed on the network. There are network build-out costs. There are resources that need to go provide installation of our CapEx into the various networks, and so we did see an uptick in that. And that's what lowered gross margins down a point on a cash basis, down two points on a GAAP basis. As you saw for the guide for Q3, we think we're probably going to hover around those levels. They're not going to worsen. If anything, they're going to be flat to up a point is what I guided. So that's where I see things in the near term, that we're probably going operate in the 77% to 78% cash margin range and probably in the 67% range for GAAP gross margins for the next few quarters. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Regarding timing of software releases and so forth, I know you probably don't want to comment too specifically. But there's talk that the Windows 10 launch could \"break the Internet,\" and one assumes that you're among those CDNs being involved in that. Is that taken into account in your third quarter guidance? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm not going to specifically comment on the Windows 10 release or any particular customer, but you can expect that we have a very close relationship with all of our large software download customers, and we have factored into our guidance an expectation from all of them. As you can imagine, with any release, the rate and pace of adoption of those releases varies. So it's not just the timing as far as when the release is provided, but it's the adoption of that release from the customers. And just to comment on Windows in particular, I think that's anyone's guess relative to \u2013 I would say enterprises are probably going to be much slower to introduce a Windows 10 release. I would say consumers, it's really a wildcard. But you can expect that we've included in our guidance an expectation of all software updates accordingly. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Will Power from Robert Baird. Please go ahead. William V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon, thanks. I guess two questions, if I may. I guess first, just maybe coming back to the media business, I wonder if you could just address what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint, both pricing and any potential lost share as you think about the traffic trends. I'll start with that. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's like it's always been. We've got a lot of competitors. The very biggest media companies will have a do-it-yourself effort in-house. Pricing is always important, very competitive there. The only I'd say major change has been over the last few years we've developed much closer and better relationships with many of the world's leading carriers, some of whom had large competitive or do-it-yourself efforts in the past and now have abandoned those efforts and decided to partner with Akamai. So that's been one, I think, change over the last few years, and that's been a favorable change. Akamai tends to have very strong share, and I think that's because of our quality, our scale, reliability, and affordability. William V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, Tom, you had alluded to in your prepared remarks some new Internet security offerings you're working on that I think you thought you might introduce sometime in 2016. I wonder if you could help frame for us either, A), how big those might be for you in 2016 and beyond, and just how you think about the size of those markets that you're going to start addressing beyond what you're perhaps addressing today? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Today our security business is on the Internet, and it doesn't extend inside the enterprise. And as we look to the future, as enterprises move more into the cloud, they're moving out into the Internet. And I think it's important for us to move into the enterprise networks with our security capabilities, and that's what we're developing today. I think it's pretty speculative, but it could be a very large market for us. As you know, phishing attacks are rampant. You have data exfiltration happening, almost daily headlines of massive exfiltration attacks being publicized, and these are areas where I think we can help. And I think it potentially is a very large market for the industry as a whole, having cloud-based offerings that help defend enterprises against those attacks. And I think it could be a large area for Akamai several years into the future. Obviously, we're in development now. If we bring a product to market next year, you wouldn't expect revenue instantly. But as we look towards the end of the decade, we think that could be a large source of revenue for us, which of course is why we're making substantial investments there today. William V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Good afternoon. As far as international, are there any particular areas that you're focused on building out your sales head count, or would it be just the most obvious markets that would follow the U.S., like Western Europe? And I guess is there any risk that you're at all late to the game in any of those markets? In other words, are there incumbent competitors that have begun to dominate some of those international markets that will create a hurdle for growth? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We've been making, our sales force investments have been pretty much in all of our markets. I would say that we're already in a lot of call it the mature markets in Europe and the mature markets in Asia, so we're just fortifying our investments in those markets. But I wouldn't characterize it as I think that there's someone incumbent that's already been there and the opportunity is lessened. We certainly have competitors in every region. In some regions there are local regional competitors, but we wouldn't be making the investments outside of the U.S. like we have if we didn't think the market was there. We think that we're significantly underpenetrated in those markets, and we think there's significant room for growth there. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): All right, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Tom. Sorry to harp on this, but I think you said pricing is very competitive, and our research indicates that a lot of your competitors seem to be \u2013 you've had a few new competitors lately, and they seem to be putting a lot more investment into CDN. Has pricing gotten a little bit worse, do you think, or is it stable? I know in the past you said it's relatively stable. And then also, Tom, can you just talk a little bit about your multicast video capabilities with Octoshape and maybe how that works, how unique is it, and what the demand looks like for it? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say that the competitive environment is pretty steady, which means with media in particular and CDN, pricing steadily drops per bit delivered or per byte delivered. And it's always been that way and I expect it always will. And in fact, we're working hard in development, and this leads into the Octoshape acquisition and their multicast and their client assisted delivery capabilities in bringing technologies to market that have an even lower cost basis in addition to having much higher quality at the same time. So I would say that pricing is \u2013 the decline in pricing is pretty stable. The level of competition is pretty stable. Traffic rises at a pretty fast clip, and pricing drops at a pretty steady clip. And then you take the product of those, and that's been leading to our revenue growth in media, which can have small fluctuations up or down in any given quarter, but generally has been a strong grower for Akamai. Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And how unique is Octoshape? What are the barriers to developing that technology that you had to acquire then? Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Octoshape has some really strong technology, first when it comes to ingress of live video where it comes from a single point, and that means you have a single point of failure. And so you really want to be sure that you get that live video stream at high quality, at high throughput, and there are no interruptions. And they have some very good communication protocols for that and some very good technology there. They also have some excellent client-side technology, which is used in the video players for both watching events on the Internet and also watching events inside an enterprise, and that technology allows you to do it at a lower cost point and also higher quality. They've been at this for a long time, and in our judgment have done some very special things that we are now integrating into the Akamai platform. Some are already benefiting us, and some will be part of our next-generation video solutions. Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Jim, the EBITDA margin if I did the math right still comes out even slightly below if you go out a decimal place to 40% to 41%. It sounds like that you have some caution on the EBITDA range going forward. So, A), in general, are you more cautious than you were on the EBITDA margin the next couple of quarters? And is there any impact from the two acquisitions that we should be backing out here? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Certainly, I mentioned that we did absorb the acquisitions in Q2, and so we have a full quarter impact in Q2. But in general for EBITDA, I would say my caution or my statements were more driven by making sure people have a consideration for what obviously is going to affect EBITDA; that we're making in particular some pretty significant investments in the network build-out which we believe are the right business decisions of the company. And while I believe we can operate the company in the 40% to 41% range, I also want to be mindful of the fact that we're not going to not make the appropriate investments in the business that we believe are the right business decisions for the company in the medium term and the long term. There are a bunch of things that can affect that, as you know. The media business in particular can have variability. And so if traffic volumes downtick a little bit, we're going to be at the lower end of that range. And I just want to make sure that I'm signaling that we intend to operate in the 40% to 41% range. There are variables that could affect that. I mentioned a couple of them. It could be network build-out being more substantive. It could be an M&A that we think is the right M&A. and if it is an M&A that is dilutive to the EBITDA model but we think is the right strategic decision for the company, then we're going to do it. But I'd say what we see right now, Michael, I think we can operate the company in the 40% to 41% range. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, Tom, if you back out the security piece from Performance and Security, just to generalize here the DSA portion of the Performance, a piece of it seems to still be growing constant currency in the low to mid-teens. I think that you had your eye on trying to reaccelerate that. Any thoughts on that? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, it's growing in the low to mid-teens. We'd like to see it grow faster, and we're putting a lot of development effort in terms of innovative capabilities around mobile acceleration. That's an area that's particularly challenged in terms of performance. And as you start to see the majority of use cases and transactions now moving to mobile, it becomes increasingly important to our customer base. You see the rapid adoption of mobile apps, and that's an area we're making investments in, and we would like to see that area grow faster. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Breen from William Blair. Please go ahead. James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question, just a couple. One, from a regulatory standpoint, given some of the interconnect deals that have happened in the space, does that impact your traffic at all over the next couple quarters? And then with respect to over-the-top video, you guys have talked about having a long-term business model growing the high teens, 17% \u2013 18% top line over the next five years. Is it safe to assume that the investments you're making in OTT would be something that could push those growth rates higher than that range? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'll take that. I don't think the regulatory environment has anything to do with an expectation of our traffic growth rates whatsoever, so I'm not quite sure what you're referring to there. But I would say that we have certainly talked about a long-term model for the company is that we believe that we have an ambition to hit $5 billion by 2020. And if you do the math on that, it means you need to grow the company around 17% on a compound annual growth rate. And we have a pretty broad portfolio between media, web performance, security, and some of the new emerging areas with the carrier and also in cloud networking. We might not necessarily get the pieces right, but each of those areas are growing significantly that we believe the combination of them is more than enough from a market opportunity perspective to grow the company at 17%. If you look through the first several years of the decade, we've been able to do that. And our expectation is if we execute well that we're certainly not market opportunity constrained. This is about execution, and I think with the combination of offerings that we have that with good execution that I think that those aspirations still make sense. James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Does it seem as though the target beat could be even higher now given the amount of focus on over-the-top traffic? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't know. I would say that it's all about rate and pace. You can see an uptick in that for a period of time. I think the media business does have variability, as we've said, so I think that could fuel the media business. And yes, I guess if you hit on all cylinders and the media business starts to accelerate because of over-the-top and we get an acceleration and continued growth in our Security and Performance businesses and we start to get traction in the newer emerging businesses, you could. We're not calling that because we know that across all of our portfolio we think there's enough that if you look at the \u2013 if you flawlessly executed against every single area, yes, we could. But I think what we're calling is in general, we think 17% on a compound annual growth rate is probably where our aspiration is. We'd love to do better. James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about Cisco. How is that partnership progressing, and in general, just your efforts to move into the enterprise and through the firewalls? How is that progressing? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: The partnership is strong with Cisco. As you know, we launched, or they launched Akamai Connect, which is software, Akamai software that's on their new branch office router, and there is customer adoption there in their sales. The product works very well. I would say it's been a slow-ish start there. We'd like to see stronger adoption, and Cisco is actively working towards that. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. These go ahead. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Tom, last quarter I think you mentioned in prior investment waves that there was a one to two-quarter lag in terms of revenue after the build-out. So heading into this particular with OTT, heading into this particular wave, is there more uncertainty about timing then you had versus past cycles? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: With OTT, I would say there's a fair amount of uncertainty. Usually the build-out is at least a couple quarters ahead, and then you have to see \u2013 or the service is launched to the subscribers by the service, and it takes time for that, so it can extend beyond a couple quarters. At this point, we are engaged in purchasing CapEx and doing build-out for 2016. And it's hard to know exactly if and when the services get launched and the adoption takes place that drives the traffic. There is a lot of buzz out there. There is excitement. I think a lot of folks in the industry think that this is going to start happening more, but it's hard to say exactly when. And that's certainly outside of our control, but we want to be ready to support our customers as they make those decisions and as they do get adoption. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I appreciate that. And then just to follow up on back to the media business, you guys have been very clear, at least in the first half of this year, about some of the tough year-over-year comparisons as it relates to renewals, as it relates to some of the big events and software releases that we had last year. But heading into the second half, I think this time last year you were also expecting more seasonal growth in Q3. You ended up having a very strong Q3 last year and having a very strong Q4 last year. So where, what were the factors if you can be more specific in terms of that we're driving the upside in Q3 and Q4 that you're just not anticipating into the second half of this year? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'll take that. As I mentioned earlier, and I even mentioned it in our prepared remarks, traffic volumes are really driven by a bunch of things. But most notably they're driven by the timing and size of gaming releases, software updates, the introduction of new features on social media platforms. So it's not just the consumption of social media, but it's also the introduction of new capabilities that get offered. As well as obviously what Tom had referred to, which is beyond over-the-top, just ongoing video delivery services. And I would say last year, what you had, it was pretty much all year, to be quite frank. We had a four-for-four on all of those that every quarter there seemed to be some large chunky gaming releases, large software updates. We saw introduction, not just more people consuming social media, but introduction of new features on social media and continuing growth in video delivery. So across all those areas is what fueled last year's media business to grow 21%. So we've said you're probably not going to grow the media business 21% every year. We just grew the media business 16% in Q1 and 17% in Q2, so pretty darn healthy growth rates off of what were very strong growth rates last year. So we're very pleased with the growth rate in the media business. Yes, you're going to see a little bit of a moderation in Q3 of this year. I think we're not worried about it because traffic volumes can vary. I don't think the trends in what drives that business have changed. It's just you're going to go through a period here where it's just a little bit lighter than maybe it was last year. And as I mentioned earlier, someone else had asked, it's too early to call Q4 because a lot of things can happen in Q4. But I want to make sure we're clear that we are very bullish on the media business. And just because it's going to moderate here a little bit in Q3, I don't think it's a sign of the health of the business at all. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I appreciate the answer, Jim. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Hi, Tom, Jim, two questions. The first is around your opportunity in the enterprise. And where I'm coming from is we do have reasonable color from you on the TV over-the-top and the security opportunities. But we lack insights on how would Akamai view the enterprise as a longer-term growth opportunity, first part of the question. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think as a longer-term growth opportunity, it is very large for us. That's why we've been placing significant investments to develop products there. They're focused in two particular areas. The first is for enterprise networking to enable an enterprise to have greatly increased and improved connectivity into the branch offices, both using its WAN and also using the Internet, and also to be able to do that at a lower price point. Many enterprises today need 10X the capacity they've got into their branch office, maybe even more as enterprise employees need to access video, to access the web directly without having to go back through the WAN into the central data center. And as they increasingly rely on the Internet, they need it to perform really well to do their jobs effectively. And enterprise networking is very expensive, and this is an area where I think we can really help. And our first offer there is Akamai Connect. Actually it's offered by Cisco. And we are working on additional offers that we hope to bring to market next year to further improve the capability of enterprise networks to be faster, more reliable, more scalable, and more cost effective. The other area which we talked about a little bit before on the call is with enterprise security, and here there are two factors. One is the enterprise is a huge target today, people trying to steal confidential information, spread viruses, do very bad things, and we've all read the headlines of the consequences of some of those bad things. And the other aspect is that the enterprise is becoming more and more vulnerable because the employees are accessing the Internet more and more to do their jobs. And so as you access the Internet, you need to be able to secure the enterprise from attacks coming in through the Internet. This is an area where we've got great expertise and have enjoyed a lot of success with the Internet side of this with our Kona Site Defender, our web app firewall, stopping DDoS attacks. And what we want to do is now bring that capability into the enterprise, to defend the enterprise employee and the enterprise infrastructure against attacks. So whereas our existing products like Kona Site Defender defend an application from bad things happening, now we'd like to defend the enterprise and the enterprise employees from bad things happening. And so those are the two areas we're focusing on for our enterprise products in the future. And I think the markets can be incredibly large there, and they can be very important for Akamai as we move later in the decade. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, that's very helpful. And then a quick second part of the question is on security. Give us a snapshot on the hiring plans. We did hear from our own channel checks, the company looking to staff up security overlay sales specialists who talk the security vernacular. So how is it going in terms of security sales hires and investing behind demand on that? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's been going well. We do have an overlay force, and we also train our existing sales force in security. And our goal is that every rep, whether you're a specialist or not, should be able to sell security. We're not there at 100% yet, but we have had good traction with security sales. And as you can see, being up 44% year over year off a number that included all of Prolexic was something that we were very happy with. And now going from near nothing a few years ago to over a $200 million trailing run rate, again, we're very happy with that. And that's a reflection on the success that the sales force has had in learning how to sell security. It takes a lot of effort, and not everybody has done it, but as a company we've had real success there, and that's great to see. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, Tom. That's been very helpful. Operator : And your next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thank you. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about the growth in the indirect channel. I think you had \u2013 over a two-year period you signed up about nine partners, if we go back to the slide deck from your Analyst Day in February. And I think if I recall you had 49% growth in that segment in the year-ago period, and you guys mentioned that that helped drive a lot of media revenue. I'm just wondering how much of a tough comp is that creating for this year? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'll take that. It does obviously create a tough comp. The channel business is actually growing faster than our direct business, and it grew faster than our direct business this quarter as well. Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: But is that growth rate decelerating materially? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's decelerating, but it's decelerating from I think a very, very high base. We signed up \u2013 all the partners that you mentioned, in particular the carrier partners, they're still our fastest growing channel. As I mentioned last year, one of the drivers of our growth rates last year in the channel was that in order to get some of these channel partners and carriers in particular, we ceded some of our direct customers to them. And so some of the growth rate that you saw last year was ceding them direct customers that they were actually able to grow even faster than we were able to grow on our own by expanding further offerings into them just based on their relationships with them. So yes, you're going to see a deceleration in the channel growth rates, but we're very pleased with the performance in the channel, and in particular pleased with the performance with our carrier partners in particular. Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And I just had one follow-up, if I could. In response to the question asked about getting to your 2020 target, and it sounds like based on your answer that over-the-top is factored into that number, given the cost of delivering that content is more than the other content you're serving now, does that mean the profitability picture or the EBITDA target in 2020 has to be altered somewhat? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, no. I think our EBITDA range reflects the fact that if you're going to have a higher weighting of media revenue, you'll obviously potentially be at the lower end of that range, but our media margins actually are very, very strong, as I share annually. Media EBITDA, media free cash flow very, very strong for the company. So I don't think it changes. Plus we have to be careful that we're in 2015 and the model is 2020, and so a lot can happen between now and then. So yes, over-the-top is likely to gain traction, but we're hoping that we're going to gain traction in other areas as well. So I'm not prepared to call that our media revenue mix is going to increase exponentially because I think we have growth opportunities outside of media as well. Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen. Please go ahead. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Most of my questions were already asked, so I'll just try to be a little bit more pointed in mine. So the DSA product, that's the one area where if I look back to last year, you've probably more consistently missed our numbers, and that's where the miss was at least in our numbers for this quarter. I know that the question was asked about that, and you mentioned that you'd like to see it growing faster, but I was just wondering. What are you doing to actually grow that faster? Is the issue with the product set? You mentioned mobile. Is it not necessarily improving mobile speeds enough that people are wanting to buy it? Is it a sales execution issue? And when can we actually expect to see some improvement in that business? And then my other question, if I go back to OTT, which I know has been talked a lot about, when I think about last quarter, you talked about increasing the CapEx spend with the expectation that that could drive OTT acceleration in the back half of 2015. Clearly, the press release and what you said on the call today indicates that you're now expecting that in 2016. Was that one or two particular OTT launches that you had anticipated to happen that just aren't happening, or has there been something else that's changed in your view of the outlook for OTT? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, I'll take those. First, with DSA, DSA is a very successful product, and it has been growing substantially. Now what we're focusing on with DSA and with Ion Standard, which we launched last year, is making it much easier to use, making it be self- configurable so that it's a more rapid sales process and customers can buy more of it more easily. And with the Ion Premium offer, that's focused on really making it be super-fast. And as I mentioned before, we're investing heavily in the mobile environment, the cellular environment where it's especially hard to get good performance. And where that becomes a lot more important is you have more mobile apps more transactions going online to mobile devices. With OTT, looking forward, as I said before, it's really hard to say for sure exactly when the various packages and offers will be coming online and predict how fast they'll be adopted by subscribers. As we look forward to the future now, we are confident enough that we're making the investments. You start see that in our financials. And as we look towards the potential revenue, I think 2016 seems like a promising time, but there's risk there. It's just impossible to say exactly when these offers become available and how fast the adoption will be. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. I wanted to follow up on Colby's question on the DSA. You mentioned better retraining of the sales force and improved execution on security. Do you get the sense there's any cannibalization going on at the sales force level perhaps now that they find it easier to sell your security products and less attention is going to DSA? And I guess the second question on that, when would you expect a product refresh on the DSA business? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. So I think there is some. It's not cannibalization per se. but as you see such great traction with security and it's the newer thing that yes, it does take more of our reps' interest. We've got a lot of focus on training there. And so I think it is possible that that's \u2013 you see such great growth there, and actually it's pretty respectable growth. We'd just like to see it better with the performance products and DSA. And in terms of the product refresh, we launched Ion Standard and Ion Premier at the end of last year. We've had strong adoption there. Ion Standard is all about ease of use, rapid adoption, self-integration, and then a situational awareness so it works in any environment, with websites, whether you're accessing it with a mobile device or off a desktop. And with Ion Premium, really focused on really fast performance; everything you can do to make the website be faster, front-end optimization, adaptive image compression, so a focus on the ultimate in speed. And as I mentioned before, there's a lot of focus now in development around other things we can do for mobile devices, especially in the cellular environment. So the product \u2013 DSA is an existing product we've had for a long time, great product. Ion Standard and Premier launched at the end of last year, and we're making improvements to those products now. Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Just a quick question on China. You have some partnerships over there that you've announced. What is the revenue opportunity for you there without a license? And is this an important market for you? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: China is an important market for us, obviously a very large market, and for our customers it's important. So we do a lot of delivery into China for our customers that are based outside of China. We do a much smaller but reasonable amount of delivery from customers in China to users outside of China. An area that we've not really tapped into yet is for domestic delivery for domestic businesses in China. That's a large market, and it's a market we hope to explore with partners. And as you know, we've announced relationships with CT and CU, and we'd very much like to work with the major carriers and the major partners in the region that do have licenses. And that's really the only way we can go to market inside of China being a non-Chinese company. Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire from CLSA. Please go ahead. Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just provide a bit of color on how your partnerships with carriers are tracking. I know you had mentioned a couple of recent wins. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say we're very happy with the relationships that we have and are establishing with the world's major carriers. We talked before about the competitive situation, and I think that's one area that there has been substantial change. You go back four or five years ago, and many of the world's leading carriers were either directly competing with us or they had a do-it-yourself effort that they were using as some kind of CDN. And many of them have now changed. The internal effort maybe didn't work out as well as they hoped, the competitive efforts weren't as successful as they had hoped, and they decided to partner with Akamai instead. And we've been very pleased to see the progress with those relationships as that's happened. I can think of one large domestic carrier that used to be very competitive with us and is now one of our largest resellers and a very happy partner with Akamai. And that's really critical I think as we go to the future because a lot of the people connect through the major carriers. A lot of the enterprise do their business through the major carriers, and it's great for us to have such a strong relationship with the world's major carriers. Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. And just to follow up, in terms of investment for the rest of the year, I know you've committed to a lot of CapEx. But what are your thoughts on continued hiring plans for sales force expansion as we look in the next couple of quarters? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would say that we are continuing to make investments across the business, so it's not just sales. As you know, we've made very, very significant investments in the sales force over the last several years. And so you can expect that probably the rate of sales adds is going to moderate here, but you can expect that across the business we're going to continue to make investments in the business. Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Great, thank you. Operator : I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Barth for closing remarks. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Thank you, Steven. In closing, we will be participating in a number of investor conferences and events in August and September. Details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. We want to thank all of you for joining us, and we wish you all a very nice evening. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Thank you very much and have a very good day.",

My name is Derrick and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We shall facilitate a question-and-answer session at the end of the conference. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Thank you and good afternoon and appreciate you joining us for Akamai's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on October 27, 2015. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was another solid quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom line. Revenue in the third quarter was $551 million, up 11% year-over-year, and up 15% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Once again, revenue growth was especially strong for our Cloud Security Solutions, which grew 44% year-over-year in constant currency. Our annualized revenue run rate for our Cloud Security Solutions now exceeds $250 million per year, making Akamai one of the Internet's largest cloud security providers. Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $0.62 per diluted share, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range and unchanged year-over-year, but up 5% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Our higher-than-expected earnings were bolstered by a favorable tax rate from a higher mix of foreign earnings, which positively impacted non-GAAP net income by $5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. I will be back in a few minutes to talk more about the third quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead. But first, let me turn the call over to Jim for our detailed financial results and the outlook for Q4. Jim? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom just highlighted, Akamai performed well in the third quarter. Q3 revenue came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range at $551 million, up 11% year-over-year or up 15% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds with solid growth across most of the business. Media revenue was $245 million in the quarter, up 5% year-over-year, or up 10% on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, we expected a moderation in media revenue growth when compared to our very strong Q3 of 2014. And while we had solid growth this quarter across the vast majority of the customer base, as expected, traffic and revenue growth slowed considerably in some of our largest media accounts. As we have discussed in the past, the drivers of the media business, namely traffic volumes and price can lead to revenue variability from period to period, given the timing of customer renewals at lower price points, the size, timing and delivery mechanism of software and gaming releases, as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities. And while media growth rates have moderated over the past few quarters as compared to the significant growth we saw in 2014, we believe the traffic and revenue growth upticks and downticks are just the nature of this business. We continue to remain bullish on the longer-term secular growth trends for this business. Turning now to our Performance and Security Solutions, revenue was $263 million in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year, or up 18% on a constant currency basis. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across most of the product lines. And as Tom mentioned, we continue to see strong growth in demand for our cloud security offerings. Third quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $65 million, up 39% year-over-year or up 44% on a constant currency basis. We are pleased with our continued growth and the market recognition of our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $43 million in the quarter, up 19% year-over-year or up 24% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see strong new customer attachment rates for our higher and enterprise class professional services as well as service offering upgrades into the installed base. Turning now to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 27% of total revenue in Q3, up one point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $150 million in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year or up 27% on a constant currency basis. The stronger dollar continued to weigh on growth rates and had a negative impact on revenue of $20 million on a year-over-year basis and $2 million on a sequential basis. On a constant currency basis, we continue to see solid growth in both our Asia Pacific and EMEA markets. Revenue from our U.S. market was $401 million in the quarter, up 10% year-over-year. Most of this quarter's media growth moderation came from the U.S. where our largest media customers reside. Outside of media, revenue growth was solid across the other product lines. And finally, revenue through channel partners represented 26% of total revenue in Q3, down one point sequentially. Channel revenue was $146 million in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year in constant currency with continued strong growth coming from our carrier partners. Moving on to costs and margins, cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q2 levels, down one point from the same period last year, and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 67%, consistent with the prior quarter, down one point from the same period last year, and also in line with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $252 million in the quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition related charges, and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $203 million, down $1 million from the prior quarter and slightly below the low end of our guidance primarily due to discretionary spending reductions. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $222 million, up $8 million from Q2 levels and up $9 million from the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, consistent with Q2 levels and down three points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $75 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and the amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $65 million, up $1 million from Q2 levels and slightly below our guidance given the timing of network and capitalized software projects deployed in the platform. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $157 million, up $7 million from Q2 levels and consistent with the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, up one point from Q2 levels and down three points from the same period last year, and above our guidance due to lower operating expenses, as I described earlier. Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the third quarter was roughly $3 million, consistent with Q2 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million, also consistent with Q2 levels. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the third quarter was $88 million, or $0.49 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $112 million or $0.62 of earnings per diluted share, coming in $0.04 higher than the high end of our guidance range. As Tom mentioned earlier, we had a more favorable tax rate than expected, driven primarily by a higher mix of foreign earnings which positively impacted non-GAAP net income by $5 million or $0.03 of earnings per diluted share. Excluding this favorable tax rate, our non-GAAP earnings would have been $0.59 per diluted share, coming in $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $26 million based on an effective tax rate of 23%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $48 million based on an effective tax rate of 30% and lower than our guidance due to a revised full year 2015 tax rate projection that reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 180 million shares, down slightly from Q2 levels and in line with our guidance. Now, I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the third quarter was 59 days, consistent with Q2 levels and down one day from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $99 million, and coming in at the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter. Capital generation continue to be solid in the third quarter. Cash from operations was $183 million in the quarter and $546 million year-to-date. During the quarter, we spent $76 million on share repurchases, buying approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price of $72. At the end of Q3, we had $231 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $815 million. As we discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times. As always, our overall goal is to deploy our capital in a manner we believe is in the best long-term interests of the company and our shareholders. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, holiday seasonality plays a large role in our performance, driven by online retail traffic for our e-commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. As a result, it is the quarter that is most impacted by the external macroeconomic environment which remains hard to predict. In addition, we expect continued foreign exchange headwinds to weigh on year-over-year growth rates. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact of $12 billion compared to Q4 of last year. Lastly, and most notably, we expect a decline in revenue in Q4 in three of our largest U.S. media accounts, driven primarily by slowing traffic growth compared to our very strong Q4 of 2014. The impact is expected to be magnified by their do-it-yourself efforts, but most of the impact is from less traffic growth overall. We are also anticipating slower traffic growth from our software download business which also had a very strong growth last Q4. To provide additional insight, it's worth noting that media pricing overall has continued to decline at normal historical levels. Competition in the media business remains constant but is not expected to be a significant factor in our traffic and revenue estimates. And while we expect media growth rates to continue to moderate in the near term and heading into 2016, we remain bullish on the medium to long-term growth prospects for this business, namely the potential for an increase in the amount of video traffic that could move online. Over-the-top traffic is much more difficult to serve at quality and scale and therefore not subject to the same do-it-yourself activity you see for less performance sensitive areas like software downloads. Factoring in all of these items, we are expecting Q4 revenue in the range of $557 million to $577 million. This range represents 6% to 10% growth adjusted for foreign exchange movement over an exceptionally strong fourth quarter last year. To frame the guidance range, if the holiday season traffic is particularly strong, you would expect to be near the higher end of the revenue range. If the holiday season traffic is weak, then we would expect to be towards the lower end of the range. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 66%. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $204 million to $211 million. We have purposefully slowed down the rate and pace of head count additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations. But we are continuing to make prudent investments in the business that we believe are necessary to build a foundation for a sustained long-term growth and scale. Factoring in the various items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of 40% to 41%. And as I have been messaging, looking beyond Q4, we will strive to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. However, to be transparent, and as I mentioned last quarter, maintaining EBITDA margins at 40% to 41% will be heavily dependent on several factors, including revenue volumes, possible M&A, spending on platform capacity in anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services and foreign exchange movements. Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $68 million to $69 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 28% for Q4. And with the overall revenue and expense configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.60 to $0.64. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $47 million to $50 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of roughly 30%. This guidance does not include a benefit from the federal R&D tax credit which is uncertain to be reinstated by the year end. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $78 million to $88 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. Of course, we will continue to balance network investment against future revenue opportunity and continued network initiatives. Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jim. As Jim just mentioned, we are projecting some moderation in the growth of our U.S. media business, primarily due to slower traffic growth in a few of our largest accounts. Of course, we are never happy to see slowdowns in traffic growth rates. But as those of you who are familiar with our 17-year history know, we have experienced similar decelerations in traffic growth in the past, most notably in 2011. And in each case, Akamai emerged stronger and more diversified than ever before, as evidenced by our business performance over the past several years. To be clear, the rest of our global media business is very healthy. Our overall media traffic is still projected to grow at a substantial pace, and I am very optimistic about the future growth of our media business. Major broadcasters and Internet companies around the globe are moving more media content online, and they are turning to Akamai for help. Online media and the potential for broadcast OTT were central themes among the 1,700 participants from 42 countries at our eighth annual customer conference in Miami last week. Media customers at the conference reaffirmed their desire to move more content online and their desire to partner with Akamai to provide the ultimate in quality, scale, and security for the delivery of their video content. At the conference, we demonstrated our latest end-to-end video delivery technology which is designed to manage the many challenges and complexities of delivering OTT content. This includes our unique approach of streaming content to a global network of over 200,000 edge servers located close to end-users, which allows us to bypass congested peering points, resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users. Our superior communication and video transport protocols which are designed to deliver the kind of higher-quality picture that is expected by users and broadcasters alike, and our client-side software, which is now installed on over 100 million clients around the world and designed to greatly improve quality and scale while also lowering costs. There is, of course, uncertainty concerning the timing of when various OTT services may become available and also how successful they will become. Our goal at Akamai is to be ready and to help enable the adoption of OTT by providing a service with true broadcast-level quality and scale. Security was also a top concern for customers across all verticals at the conference. Many customers toured our Security Operations Center in Fort Lauderdale where they witnessed first-hand how our flagship security solutions, Kona Site Defender and Prolexic, are differentiated by their scale, their sophistication, and their unique ability to sustain performance while leveraging our massively distributed platform as a defensive shield against attacks. We also demonstrated our new Client Reputation and bot management services. Our first Client Reputation service was introduced in Q2 and already has over 40 customers. This service identifies IP addresses that have attacked or abused customer websites by leveraging behavioral analytics and the enormous volume of web traffic that Akamai handles. Our customers can then proactively alert or block the malicious users based on a risk score derived from their prior actions. Bot manager is our newest security service and is now in beta with 18 customers. Bots are automated software agents, and they have become a significant issue for our customers. On a typical day, Akamai sees over 10 billion requests from over 60 million bots. Some bots, such as search engine bots, are helpful, but many are harmful. Malicious bots can steal intellectual property and personal information, scrape prices, and consume significant bandwidth and server resources. Some of our customers have been surprised to learn that over half of their traffic is from bots. Bot manager identifies over 1,200 types of bots and enables our customers to customize their response to request based on the type of bot. Typical responses include allowing fast and unlimited access for search engines, prioritizing the activity of partner bots, and slowing down responses or serving alternate content to malicious bots. Although we are excited about our new Client Reputation and bot management services, our longer term ambitions for security are much broader. Thus far, Akamai's approach to security has been to focus on protecting data centers, websites, and web applications from cyber attacks. Going forward, we also plan to create cloud services designed to protect end users and enterprise employees from malicious web attacks. Our first enterprise security product is scheduled for release in late 2016, and it is designed to detect and prevent phishing, malware, and data exfiltration attacks against enterprises. Building on the acquisition of Xerocole earlier this year, we have already deployed some of this technology in a product for our carrier partners which they use to block access to undesirable sites for their subscribers. This technology is already being used to process many billions of requests per day on behalf of 50 million subscribers across 21 carrier partners. We plan to combine the data gathered from these requests with the already enormous amount of data that Akamai gathers on a daily basis to further strengthen all of our cloud security offerings. In addition to working with many of the world's leading carriers, we are also establishing close relationships with major cloud providers. Last week at our customer conference, we were very pleased to announce our new partnership with Microsoft, which will provide for automated access to Akamai's content delivery network through Microsoft Azure. The new Azure CDN offering is designed to optimize the delivery of content and the performance of applications deployed on Azure. As part of our expanded relationship, Microsoft sales force is also planning to sell Akamai's market-leading acceleration and security solutions. In summary, we are continuing to focus on solving the grand challenges faced by our customers, delivering video over the Internet with unprecedented quality, scale, and affordability; providing near instant performance for websites and apps on any device anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyber attacks that seek to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data, or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to handle new cloud workloads efficiently, securely, and cost effectively. These are very hard problems, but I believe that Akamai is very well-positioned to provide solutions, and that by doing so, we can continue to return significant value to our shareholders. I also want you to know that while there will always be bumps along the way, I am as excited as ever about our prospects for future growth. Thank you for your time today. Now, Jim and I will take your questions. Operator : Our first question will be from the line of James Breen, William Blair. Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of questions, one on the guide. Jim, can you give some color into the breakdown there? It sounds like Performance and Security is doing okay. So the weakness relative to where consensus was, is that mainly in the media group? And I guess for Tom on that, is this sort of a fundamental change with your relationship with those three big media companies? There has always been a concern about some of those large players doing it themselves in terms of handling traffic internally within their own networks. Can you sort of give us some color on that? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I'll take the first part of it. Then I can let Tom comment on kind of the do-it-yourself efforts. But certainly you could tell from the guide, this is predominantly a media story as far as the deceleration in growth rate that we're still having very, very healthy growth rates in our Performance and Security Solutions, and our Services and Support Solutions. We don't guide necessarily by product category, but if you generally look at the growth rates we've had in those other areas, you can certainly see that media growth rates are going to be effectively flat to up very significantly, or down very significantly. This is largely in the Americas, and it is really very heavily focused on these three particular accounts, and as you can imagine, we had a huge, huge Q4 last year with these accounts. These accounts in Q4 grew well over 40% year-over-year last Q4. So it's a very difficult compare, but admittedly, we are seeing a slowdown in those accounts off of very strong Q4 of last year, and it is magnified by the fact they do serve some of their own traffic. But we believe kind of the bigger slowdown in traffic here is that traffic overall is slowing, not so much an acceleration and kind of do-it-yourself. And Tom can maybe comment on do-it-yourself. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I don't see a fundamental change in our relationship with our largest media customers. I am close to these accounts, and I would say our relationships are very strong. Now, as we've talked about, the largest few media companies do have do-it-yourself efforts, and we've competed with these efforts very successfully over the years, and I think we continue to do that. Now, one thing that happens when they carry a substantial portion of their traffic over do-it-yourself networks is, if the overall traffic is less growing at a slower rate and less than expected, well, there's a tendency to fill up the do-it-yourself effort first, and then we would get the remainder which leaves us with even slower traffic growth. And we are projecting to see some of that in Q4, and maybe into early next year. The flip side of that coin, we saw last year, whereas if the traffic is growing stronger than projected and at a very fast clip, then we tend to get more than we would otherwise get because it flows to us. So the DIY effort does tend to magnify the swings, with the largest few accounts. And those customers do provide a significant portion of our media revenue and so you do see it reflected in the guidance going forward. Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: And you're seeing the growth internationally. I'm assuming it's one \u2013 with some of those accounts as well, they're feeling that you are still going to be a main supplier for them in terms of transport outside the U.S.? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, we have very strong relationships on a global basis with the major media companies. We have not seen the same behavior that we have in the three accounts that we talked about. We haven't seen that behavior as much overseas. And in general, I am very bullish on the medium and long-term growth of the media business. We continue to invest there, and we are seeing the deceleration in the three particular accounts now, and that may persist for some time. But I think then, as we look at potential of more video moving online, we have to see what the timing of that is and the scale. But that could put us in a very good position for future growth. Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: And just one last one. Does this at all change your longer term view of high-teen's growth over the next five years? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We still have the same goals for 2020. We are on a good clip overall for that. I think we are ahead of where we needed to be. On the other hand, as growth decelerates in media in the near term, we'd like to see that reaccelerate in the future. I should also add, in terms of the DIY, the DIY is most relevant for the kinds of traffic where performance is not as important. An example would be a background software download. And there's literally been cases where it might take eight hours whereas on Akamai, it might take eight minutes and if it's in the background and not urgent, maybe that's okay. As we look to the future and you think about what really drives traffic growth in the future, and probably video is a big source of that, particularly live and linear video and broadcast moving over-the-top over the longer-term, that is much harder to do, and performance really matters a lot. And there were a lot less \u2013 DIY is a lot less competitive in that kind of situation. Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gray Powell, Wells Fargo. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. So your server account really spikes starting in mid-2015, and I guess that it's in anticipation of future traffic growth likely in 2016. I'm just kind of curious what kind of visibility do you have on initiatives that could drive traffic growth higher next year. And then what's your confidence level around them? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say that we have some visibility there, but there's a lot of uncertainty, and there's a lot of factors that are certainly beyond our control. I think with perfect hindsight, we probably would've spent a little bit less on CapEx this year, but we don't have perfect view into when various OTT offers will become available or how successful they'll be. And our goal is to be ready and to make sure that we have a platform that can deliver any broadcast OTT that becomes available in very high quality and scale and also make sure it's affordable. And so we will, as we talked about before, lean in there. And really the worst that happens is we are a little too early and that we will eventually be using that capacity. And we just don't know exactly when, but we're going to be ready. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. And then that actually kind of leads into my next question. If I look at 2013 and 2014 and your cash expenditures like CapEx plus OpEx, they grew at a slightly faster pace than revenue. And then in 2015, we've seen a bit of a divergence with expenses growing more in excess of revenue. I know you don't want to give guidance on 2016, but when should we see more of a direct correlation between expense and revenue growth? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, yeah, to be clear, I think what you've outlined is true. But we were very clear that was our intention. The intention of the company back in the 2012 timeframe was we felt that we were going to purposely lower the financial model of the company to make what we thought were the right investments to drive future growth and scale. And so it was by design that we made these investments. Yes, they grew at a faster pace than revenue growth, more on the OpEx side than the CapEx side. And certainly, as you can see, we did moderate spending in Q3 with the near-term revenue moderation that we saw. We are moderating spending in Q4. And we'll continue to manage spending in alignment with revenue growth of the company. I did provide some caveats that obviously \u2013 that depends upon revenue volumes, possible M&A we do and things of that nature. But I want to be clear that where the company financial model is now is effectively what we said we were going to do. Yes, this year we're going through a year where we're spending a little bit more on CapEx. So my \u2013 long-term model that I provided has 18% of revenue as kind of the high. And we're probably going to be more in the 19%. And that's largely from building up more network CapEx, as Tom mentioned, which is a bit in anticipation or was in anticipation of demand in the future. And as Tom said, the timing of that is very, very difficult to assess. But we get better visibility, call it, on a three-month window. And so we can always moderate future CapEx investments based on the visibility that we see. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. That makes sense. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Sterling Auty, JPMorgan. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks. Wanted to start with \u2013 I still want to get a little bit more clarity in terms of when we look at the fourth quarter and the slowdown in media, exactly how much of the slowdown is the DIY impact versus how much of that slowdown is just general slowing volumes in the media industry or segment? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. It's mostly the former, which is the top three accounts. And again, these top three accounts in our media business represent a reasonably large percentage because these are big, big, big media companies. So the biggest share of the revenue deceleration and actually these three accounts are declining year-on-year. And so again, their revenue weighting is pretty high for our media business. The rest of the media business is actually performing reasonably well. We are seeing a little bit of a slowdown, as I mentioned, in our software download customers. And as we've shared with you in the past that the timing of gaming and software downloads varies from quarter to quarter, we're not expecting a huge software download quarter. We expect a reasonably good gaming quarter this quarter, but the bigger driver of the revenue deceleration is these large three accounts and modestly a little bit of softening in the software download customer base. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. And that is the overall traffic is not growing at as fast a clip. And as we talked about a few minutes ago, when you combine that with an existing DIY infrastructure and the nature of that traffic, that can lead to substantially disproportionate deceleration in the traffic that we're carrying in those accounts. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, about a year ago, you were willing to at least give us a way to triangulate the size of your largest media customer. I think you gave us a percentage of accounts receivable. Can you give us some sense of what portion of the media business these top three represent? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'm not going to provide a specific percentage. Obviously, as I shared before, our largest customer, we don't have any 10% customers, but as I shared before, we obviously have had a 10% receivable customer in the past. And these three customers are, call that, no one is larger than the largest customer, but customers two and three are not that much smaller. So that gives you some kind of order of magnitude of the size of these customers. And these are almost predominantly, not exclusively, but almost predominantly media customers. So that's largely where you see the impact for our media business. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And last question (37:50) you talked, Tom, I think you mentioned that this impact could persist. Should we be walking away from this thinking that we need to see the OTT initiatives kicking in as the catalyst to get this part of the business to rebound, or is there any other items that could come along to offset some of this impact? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the even years can be better in terms of the major sporting events like Olympics and so forth. And events themselves don't do that much, but they do tend to get people to try a higher bandwidth or higher quality format which drives more traffic, more devices are used. So there can be some benefit there. I would say if large amounts of content, broadcast content, comes over the top, that can make a difference. And then obviously we're sort of setting up a different base here, at least we're projecting to through Q4. And so just with time through the year, the effect will become mitigated in terms of our growth rates. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Steve Milunovich, UBS. John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you for taking the questions. John Roy in for Steve. Hey, I know you don't have the OTT timing, but can you give us an idea what OTT might do to margins? Any type of color would be useful on that. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the volume of traffic we talked about, I think, on the call last time. If you imagine, and I don't know if and when this will happen, you had five million people watching, and they were watching at a pretty reasonable quality, and the target these days is for 10 million people, that's 50 terabits a second, which is more traffic than we're pumping right now. So there's a large amount of traffic there. We are working, as Jim said, to stay in the zone of 40% to 41% EBITDA margins. If there was \u2013 inside there are things, as Jim said, that can take you out of that zone. But that's our expectation at this point in time. John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Vijay Bhagavath, Deutsche Bank. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Hi, Tom. Hi, Jim. Question on your DIY comments. We could have the Bears pick on that comment tomorrow morning. So please clarify to us the DIY commentary around over-the-top and also help us understand what aspects of the media delivery business that some of these customers would be doing it themselves. And then would that be like a contagion that could spread potentially to some of the other customers? Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. Again, we've been competing with DIY in our largest handful accounts for almost forever, over 10 years, certainly. And DIY is mostly used for the delivery of items where performance is not important or where maybe it's easier to do static objects is an example. DIY is not nearly the kind of competitor to us for things like live and linear broadcast or content that might move over the top in a pay subscription kind of model where a user expects very high quality, they are paying for it and it's very hard to do. So that's where DIY comes into play. A top few customers do it. And to be honest, over time, I think they find that it's not as productive as they thought to do it, and so sometimes a large customer will end their DIY capability, and then you will see them a few years later try to start another project. I know of one large account that's gone through the entire cycle twice. It's not something that I think even makes any sense at all for somebody who is not a giant media company, just \u2013 it's not going to be any kind of quality you'd want to have and it doesn't even make sense financially, I think. The very biggest media companies there, I think they've all tried it. Many of them use it and we have been competing with it for a long time very successfully. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then a quick follow-on, Tom, on over-the-top. Could we view over-the-top more as an overlay service that would be accretive to EBITDA margins that over-the-top revenue dollars start flowing in? And then also with over-the-top, do you anticipate value-added opportunities such as student-forward (42:46), encryption, ad insertion? Would those be above and beyond how you monetize the core over-the-top traffic activity? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we monetize the end-to-end process for over-the-top, often with partners for some components of it. The large majority of the revenue there is with the delivery because of the scale and the enormous number of bits that might be carried if broadcast TV were to move over-the-top in a major way. It's not just free. There is substantial expense in actually delivering all that traffic and providing all that functionality. So it's not the kind of thing that just comes in as revenue with no cost associated with it. There is significant cost, including the build-out of the platform itself. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Mark Kelleher, D.A. Davidson. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. If I look at your Performance and Security group, it looks like the sequential increase was entirely from the cloud security side. What's going on, on the other side, the web performance? What are your expectations there? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I mean, certainly that we had another very, very strong quarter in our Cloud Security Solutions, they grew 44% in Q2, they grew 44% again in Q3. You did see a slight moderation in, call it, the other businesses that are in there, the largest of which is our web performance business. We've seen a bit of a deceleration in their product line for the last few quarters. Bookings continue to be reasonable, as I've said before, that there is a tremendous amount of excitement with our sales teams in selling our new security offerings, and I think that there is a fair amount of focus in that area. So, yeah, we probably could do a little bit better in that segment, we know that. We're doing very strong in security, maybe not as strong in the web performance business. But I think it's \u2013 we're keeping at it. There's a significant market opportunity for us to further penetrate in that space. It's just a matter of continuing to execute and innovate. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Michael Turits, Raymond James. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. A couple of clarifications and then a question. So just to make sure what right that you did expect the media delivery to be flat to down next quarter? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And also, sort of a clarification is one \u2013 so through the two large accounts, a bulk of the impact was mostly DIY, organic slowing. But what really was the organic slowing due to? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, it's actually more \u2013 these three accounts, these big, big accounts do DIY and in a couple of these big accounts, Akamai is the exclusive CDN provider. No, this slowdown is not so much an increase in DIY. As Tom tried to outline, which is, overall traffic is lower. And so what's happening is that they've continued to build on DIY, which they've been doing all along and their traffic has moderated overall. They are serving more of the traffic themselves, and less is going to us. So if you generally look at it from a share perspective that yes, they are taking more of the share of the traffic, but it's because overall traffic in aggregate is less than expected. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And what's the reason for that slowing \u2013 that organic slowing of traffic? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I mean, that's tough to tell. I mean, this is the nature of our business that we can't control how many people are doing a download, how many people are doing various things. So that's really an end user thing. So why it's slowing for our customers is difficult for us to assess. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And if I get one last one in there, Jim, just to \u2013 did I mention or did you talk about the CapEx rate going forward? Any thoughts on CapEx in 2016, obviously you haven't given guidance, but where we might think about it relative to the range? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I mean, I think what I did say, I mean I provided guidance for the quarter. I think we said that, we'd be, call it, in the low $80 millions (47:28) for CapEx. So we're going to be a little bit above my long-term model of 18% this year. Again, we're going to strive to manage the company, call it, around the 18% of revenue going forward. That's the long-term model that I've highlighted all along. There is going to be periods of time as we've had before, it could be at 17%. There could be a period of time where we're at 19%. I'm actually not going to quibble between a point here or there to be honest with you. We're going to make the investments that we think are the right investments for the business, either on R&D innovation, which is around software capital, or as Tom indicated, if we need to make more network CapEx investments because we think they're the right thing to do to support what we think is going to be coming demand, we'll do that. But generally speaking, we're going to strive to manage CapEx around 18% of revenue. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Jim. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Philip Winslow, Credit Suisse. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, guys. This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil. I just wanted to ask on the gross margin side, you came in at the low end of the guidance and I think also guided below consensus. Just wondering how much of this impact due to the CapEx investment you did in the last few quarters versus some of the \u2013 co-location and bandwidth costs that you are seeing in the quarter. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, it's largely from what we've talked about. We've been building out CapEx really for the first three quarters of the year in a fairly substantive way. If you take the year-to-date, CapEx as a percent of revenue has been well north of 20%. We're not expecting that for the full year, because you're seeing it moderate here in the fourth quarter. So as you build up more CapEx and you deploy more servers in the network and you are incurring co-location costs, you're going to see an uptick in cost of goods sold. And certainly, as we've talked about, we're building out, or we did build out in anticipation of wanting to make sure that we have the capacity available. We did signal that that may have near-term pressure on gross margins and that's what you're seeing. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): But any changes in terms of co-location and bandwidth costs in recent quarters? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I mean no change in \u2013 from a color perspective around in general the market for bandwidth or co-location spending. As you can imagine that, bandwidth in particular that as you have contracts in some cases that you have fixed port arrangements that you're building out, and if you're not building those fixed ports at a fixed cost that you're not monetizing. But again, that's something that we signaled that it was a bet we were willing to make. If in fact, we've built out more capacity than is needed, we'll grow into it. And so that's effectively what we're doing. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs. Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. I've got a couple. I guess the first, going back to these DIY comments, I guess what I'm trying to parse, given the guidance for this segment in Q4, why isn't that going to persist for the next three quarters where you are going to be flat to down year-over-year? I mean this is the first quarter you've really made a big point about driving this home. So I'm not sure what's going to change over the course of the next three quarters that's going to make this growth rate be positive. So if you could comment on that. I know you are not trying to give long-term guidance, but it just seems like this is something that's going to persist until you anniversary it. I guess the other part of the question would be just as traffic growth flows and I guess \u2013 I just \u2013 I have listened to some conflicting data. You're trying to say that it's not because they are doing more in-sourcing when in the beginning it said that you were seeing more in-sourcing. I get that your \u2013 the share of traffic is going down because volume is slower. But these top three customers all seem to be building out their own CDN networks as well. So is there a chance that this is just a new trend that you are going to have to live with, with your share of traffic that's just going to continue to go down? So I guess what gives you the confidence that that's not going to happen? And then my last question \u2013 sorry, to put so many in there, but how do you get to that $5 billion target you laid out in 2020 without M&A being included for at least a few points per year of that CAGR you are forecasting? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. That was a bunch. Let me try to take them in order. So I think we did signal in our guidance, I am not certainly providing guidance for 2016 on this call, but we certainly did signal that we do expect that what we're seeing here in the fourth quarter is going to continue into 2016. As you know, the nature of traffic is it spikes and as it goes up and it goes down. So it's difficult to predict whether, to your point, it is a wraparound and you go through this for three quarters and then you see it again in Q4. It's tough to tell. That is one possible scenario, the scenario that these customers' overall traffic volumes continue to accelerate and our share then increases. So these are customers that have planned to do DIY. They have been doing it for a while. It's very difficult to assess what's going to happen next year. But we do expect that there will be a moderation. As you've seen in the past, we've been surprised at the upside. As Tom mentioned, both in 2013 and 2014, we were talking about over-achievements in media growth, and we specifically talked about our large customers, and that's really what the driver was, the same phenomena. Also, it's fair to say that growth outside of these three customers in the media is doing very well. Our international growth is strong in the media business, and is strong in other segments of our U.S. market as well. So again, we're going to go through a period here. How much affect it has on growth rates in 2016, I think, remains to be seen. But we do expect to see this persist into 2016. And whether or not we're going to need M&A to hit our ambition for $5 billion that if you think about the markets that we are in, you look at the media market, and you think about the amount of traffic that could move online, that we would be poised to benefit from. That's a significant growth catalyst in the media business. Our Performance and Security Solutions by themselves have significant growth opportunities. And then there's new emerging areas that we are just barely getting into in cloud networking that by themselves could be huge growth opportunities for the company. So there's enough catalysts across the portfolio to certainly achieve the ambitions that we have. The challenge you have with the media business is sometimes the media business is in acceleration and aids you in your quest to get \u2013 the CAGR needs to be around 17% to get there. Sometimes it's going to be lower, but I think over time, there's enough growth catalysts in the company to be able to do that. It's a matter of innovating, and it's a matter of executing. Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. So M&A is not in your target then for 2020? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, no, M&A is \u2013 I would say... Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: (55:18) James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We talked about the fact that \u2013 no, we don't have a specific number for M&A. We've been doing M&A where we think it makes sense for the company to either expand into an adjacent area that there has been technology tuck-ins that we believe that will help secure an area that we want to do from an innovation perspective. So we certainly did the acquisition of Prolexic, which did contribute revenue. Most of our acquisitions to date have not been revenue contributions, they've been more technology tuck-ins. That's not to say that we're not actively searching, and that there may be something that is of revenue contribution. But we don't have a specific target in mind for what M&A is going to be to deliver to the $5 billion ambition. Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Mike Olson, Piper Jaffray. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hey. Good afternoon. So based on the slowdown in media revenue, I would imagine a lot of people are going to start looking for signposts to give us a sense for whether or not OTT is starting to take off to come in and rescue the media business. What would you suggest the timing of that is as far as more and more material OTT revenue, and what signposts would you watch for if you were us for getting a sense if we're getting closer to that? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, we don't really know of any dates, in particular. I think in terms of watching for signposts, you'd look for offers that come to the market, you'd look for adoption rates of those services. Is it being successful, are users watching more video content online? And then we don't have any dates in mind that we're in a position to share around that. We're going to be ready and we're going to try to help enable it and then we'll see how things unfold next year. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): All right. And then on the security side, is it around 2,000 or so, maybe 5,500 total customers now that are using security around 35% to 40% of your customer base that are on a security solution? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's generally in the ballpark, yes. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Colby Synesael, Cowen & Company. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to go back to the performance portion of the business or DSA. That business, as you mentioned, Jim, has been, I think, weak relative to expectations for the last few quarters now. And I know you mentioned that really what needs to be done here is just better execution. But would you argue that it's more because the competitive dynamic in that aspect of the business has increased, which is making execution more difficult? Or is it that the products that you have right now are arguably ahead of where the market is in terms of demand, and we're just not there where you are seeing just a tremendous amount of demand whether it's for your products or either of your competitors' products in the segment of the business? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, I mean, I think it's difficult to tell that it's \u2013 certainly, we can execute better in that area. What share of it is driven by what drivers is tough to tell. There is certainly still a significant market opportunity for it. I think what we need to do is, in particular, and our sales team is doing this that you've got to go through multiple go-to-market motions both direct and indirect in being able to build out effective channel relationships to be able to sell this and get better acceleration on it that's not just from your direct sales force. It still is a product that requires a fair amount of handholding to be sold, so it's not an easily channeled sellable product. We're working on that. And so there's probably an element of that that is disruptive to being able to get that business back to where we need it to be. But we do think that with continued innovation on the product side, as well as maybe continued focus from a go-to-market perspective around not just going deep and wide with our customers. So the customers that we're going to try to up-sell them to the higher value ion offerings as well as getting new customers, that's really the recipe. It's about executing on the innovation side and executing on the go-to-market side. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Ed Maguire, CLSA. Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Yes. Good afternoon. Just a question on traffic volume. So a few years ago, you had this phenomenon of the number of customers renegotiating their rates for large contracts. And I was wondering if that's a dynamic that you expect to come into play over the next couple of quarters. In other words, if the rate of growth in traffic at these largest customers is slowing, are they still paying a higher tariff? And is there risk of downward resets among some of your other customers on volume-based pricing? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Pricing steadily declines. And I would say in the period we are in now, it's pretty normal; nothing unusual or no bad news there in terms of our revenues. So now when customers send more traffic to us, they often get a lower price. So you have large volumes and traffic costs less per bit than small volumes and traffic. But if you look at constant amount of traffic through time, pricing steadily decreases, and there's really no fundamental change there. Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. And if I may, the international growth is really strong. Is there an appreciable difference in the composition of the revenue contribution from your customers outside the U.S. that's really behind that growth? And is that itself sustainable as well in your view? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we are very pleased with the growth in the international markets. It accelerated over Q2 that \u2013 I would say that we still think there's huge opportunity to continue to grow the international markets faster than our U.S. markets, for sure. But as far as the mix, actually, the mix contribution between Media, Performance and Security, and Services and Support is roughly similar across all three geographies. Admittedly, though, in the EMEA and APJ (62:22) geographies that there isn't any significant concentration from customers. And so they call it the diversification of their customer base is a little bit broader whereas in the U.S., we have very, very large U.S. media customers that tend to have a pretty high share of some of our U.S. media business. And so obviously when you have a downturn there, notable both for the U.S. market as well as the total companies, but that just gives you maybe a little bit of color on the mix profile. Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Bowen, Pacific Crest. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon. I hate to beat a horse here, but the more I listen to the call, the more I still keep coming back to the fact that we don't really seem to know collectively when or if the traffic volumes on the media side are going to improve. So maybe coming at it from this side, can you guys talk a little bit about what your thoughts are with regard to over-the-top as far as a TAM? And then give us some thoughts with regard to perhaps adoption in 2016. What's your \u2013 obviously, you are spending a lot of CapEx as a percentage of revenue to address this opportunity and others. So I'm trying to get a better gauge on timing and magnitude of this opportunity because right now weakness will continue into 2016 was your statement. But I have to think that that turns if OTT manifests like a lot of us think it will. Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I really can't comment on adoption rates in 2016. I wish I could, but I can't. But the TAM, what hypothetically could be possible is very large. Just think about all the people that watch TV, and imagine if even a very small portion of them started watching TV online. And you think about what quality they might do that at someday. The old DVD format, I say old, but the DVD format is about four megabits per second, compressed 4K. Sort of the next gen format is 16 megabits a second. The average of that is 10 megabits a second, and that's where we see the major broadcasters having an interest in targeting bandwidth rates for watching a single stream at 10 megabits a second. And as I mentioned earlier that if you had five million people doing that at the same time, that's 50 terabits a second and that's a heck of a lot of traffic, and that's only five million people. Now, you think farther into the future, some people think that someday, I don't know if it's by the end of the decade or not, that maybe most watching, there's more watching online than on TV, the traditional mechanisms. And that's hundreds of millions of people and maybe 1 billion someday. So when you think about the TAM, it's an enormous TAM. And that's why I think there's so much interest, not here, but in the industry, around OTT. Now, I know you all are interested, as are we as when does that start. And we don't know. We are, to the point, today where we can enable it from the technology perspective and from the financial perspective. We can do it at a good quality, we can do it at scale, not 1 billion yet, 1 billion viewers, but certainly the scale where we would start out and we can do it at a reasonable price point that can enable that to take place. And from there, we are watching and working with the industry to try to facilitate that to happen. But a lot of that is beyond our control. Certainly, the users at the end of the day, the subscribers, will dictate how much watching is done OTT. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : And that's helpful. I mean clearly, we have two dynamics here, right? You've got whether or not overall traffic is going to increase, and I think it probably will due to OTT. But then you have got the DIY versus coming to you. So if you look at some of the smaller media companies, is there some type of threshold, or how can we think about what size company out there may think \u2013 how big do you have to be to do it yourself versus coming to you? How do they make those decisions? What are those breakpoints? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We only see meaningful DIY in a handful of accounts, and it's not for live linear video. Now that doesn't say that someday people won't be doing DIY themselves for OTT broadcast content OTT. But we don't really see that today. The DIY we see is a handful of very large media accounts, and it's focused on more static \u2013 the delivery of static content and often where performance doesn't matter. Obviously, with paid subscription OTT, performance matters a lot, or the subscriber is not going to pay. They're not going to be happy. And as we look across the major broadcasters today, I really don't see DIY as being a factor there, at least for now. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Greg McDowell, JMP Securities. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Hi. This is Rishi Jaluria dialing in for Greg McDowell. Thank you for taking my questions. Mostly follow-up questions on all the stuff we've been discussing. First, just wanted to go a little bit deeper on CapEx. I know you have mentioned in the past that your CapEx is mainly server build-out preparing for this OTT opportunity. Putting aside questions around the timing of when OTT will become more widespread or see that adoption, at what point do you think Akamai in terms of its server build-out and capacity is going to be ready for that opportunity whenever it comes? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I mean, that's, obviously, we are building out based on discussions that we have with folks in the ecosystem. We've certainly \u2013 what is a lot of uncertainty about what is going to get introduced, when it's going to get introduced, what the adoption rates are going to be. So as Tom indicated, yes, we have done build-out and the build-out means that we have available capacity. It is an (69:17) infinite capacity, obviously. This would be, call it, we built out capacity for what could be the first wave of some level of over-the-top. I think we certainly did signal that we do expect generally traffic moderation going into 2016. And I do believe \u2013 just to be clear, I do believe that there are \u2013 the biggest catalyst that's going to cause traffic growth to reaccelerate is going to be continued movement of premium content online. The rate and pace of that is very, very difficult to assess. I mean, some of it is being done now. So it's not like it's not being done now, it's just being done now on a very much smaller scale. The question is when does it start to get hold in a more fulsome scale, and I think that will be the catalyst. But I think without that, I think there are certainly headwinds that we have going into 2016 on traffic, just to be very clear. I think Heather asked earlier that is tough to tell with these large three customers what their traffic volumes are going to do, whether their traffic volumes accelerate or not. So there's a bunch of dynamics that will have an impact on the media business in the near term. So I just want to make sure we're clear that we think that there are certainly catalysts to grow this business in the medium term to long term. We're not calling out guidance here for 2016, but it's just important to be clear with you that certainly we do see deceleration in traffic. We do think that there are going to be catalysts for traffic growth. The question is rate, pace, and timing. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then following up on OTT, you did mention it's a major opportunity for Akamai. And you also mentioned on this call that you're seeing slowdown in growth with your three largest, let's call it, U.S. media delivery customers. I just wanted to get a better handle on how significant that OTT opportunity internationally outside the U.S. can be. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think the math is the same. It could be very significant. There's obviously a lot more TV watchers and people online outside of the United States than here. Many countries are better connected with their Internet than here. So in the long run, I would say it's a larger market, potential market outside the U.S. than inside the U.S. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then in terms of \u2013 you touched on your partnership with Microsoft. Is this primarily going to be an impact on the Performance and Security side of the business versus the Media side? And what sort of impact do you think that it could have on the company over the next several quarters? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I would hope it would have a positive benefit to both our Media business and our Performance business and our, for that matter, our Security business. That Microsoft will be selling all of our services and in terms of the basic Azure CDN capability, you will be able to automatically take advantage of Akamai's base level CDN capabilities. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then last one, I will jump off. But it looks like this quarter the rate of employee addition is a lot slower than it's been in, I don't know, let's call it, the past six quarters. Was this primarily the result of cost controlling, or was this more in anticipation of this slowing down of traffic growth that you talked about? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Certainly, when we guided for the quarter for Q3 that we certainly did guide that OpEx expense was going to slow, we certainly had better visibility of what we thought was going to be happening going into Q4 as the quarter progressed. And so we did moderate hiring as the quarter progressed. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Okay, very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Okay. Well, thank you. I appreciate there is a few more in the queue, but we are well overtime. So I apologize if we weren't able to answer your questions today. But in closing, we want to thank you for joining us. We'll be participating on a number of investor conferences and events in November and December. Details of these can be found in the Events section on the Investor Relations website at akamai.com and we look forward to seeing you at those events. Thank you again for joining us and have a nice evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

(Broker) Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Akamai Technologies Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon and thank you for joining Akamai's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 earnings call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 9, 2016. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us. Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom line. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $579 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Our revenue overachievement compared to guidance was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security services as well as a strong holiday commerce season. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.72 per diluted share, up 3% year-over-year and up 5% when adjusted for currency headwinds. Our better than expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues, improved efficiency and a $0.06 benefit from the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. We also had very strong cash generation in the fourth quarter with free cash flow of $139 million. Our fourth quarter results capped off another excellent year for Akamai. In 2015, we generated $2.2 billion in revenue, up 16% in constant currency over an outstanding 2014. As a result, Akamai is now one of only 11 U.S. public Internet software and services companies that has generated over $2 billion in annual revenue. Our performance in Security Solutions topped $1 billion in revenue in 2015, making this our largest solution category. Contributing to that result were our Cloud Security Solutions, which grew 54% for the year and now have an annual revenue run rate of nearly $300 million. We continued to be very profitable in 2015, generating non-GAAP net income of $454 million or $2.52 per diluted share, up 6% over 2014 in constant currency. I believe our excellent 2015 financial performance demonstrates that our business is strong, growing, and highly profitable, validating our comprehensive strategy to make the Internet fast, reliable, and secure for our customers. In support of this strategy, we are laser focused on solving four grand challenges : delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale and affordability; providing near instant performance for websites and apps on any device, anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyber attacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to handle growing cloud workloads efficiently and securely. Security, in particular, is a pervasive concern for customers across all verticals and geographies, and it is a tremendous growth opportunity for Akamai. In addition to world-class protection, our unique cloud-based security solutions offer substantial advantages such as quick implementation without the need for data center hardware, easy deployment across a wide range of web infrastructures and enhanced performance for web applications. When deploying Akamai's security solutions, there is no need to upgrade or replace hardware to meet ever changing threats. Our cloud security services are designed to enable customers to rapidly deploy a known standard set of security protection across all of their websites, regardless of how or where they are hosted. And unlike traditional approaches to security, which can slow down performance, Akamai's security solutions have been shown to actually improve performance. This means that Akamai's solutions can be used in an always on proactive mode which provides substantially improved security for websites and applications. Our Cloud Security Solutions are also differentiated by the quality of our security data. With our unique global platform, Akamai is able to gather more than 20 terabytes of security data every day. We process this data using real-time behavioral analysis and machine learning algorithms to continuously improve our level of protection. We are also using this data to provide advanced services such as Client Reputation which we launched late last year and bot manager which we plan to introduce at the upcoming RSA Conference later this month. As we look forward, we plan to expand our suite of security solutions to also protect enterprise employees from phishing and malware attacks. Our first offering in this area is scheduled to be released later this year, and it will make use of our successful AnswerX recursive DNS platform to block access to malicious sites that propagate malware or aid in the exfiltration of confidential corporate data. Through partnerships with many of the world's leading carriers, our AnswerX platform is already being used on a daily basis in tens of millions of homes around the world to block access to undesirable content. By leveraging the AnswerX platform to provide security for our enterprise customers, we plan to substantially expand the addressable market for our security solutions. In the long run, we believe that the market for enterprise security solutions in the cloud could exceed our current market for protecting websites and applications. We are also very excited about the opportunity for growth in our media business. Our Media Delivery Solutions generated nearly $1 billion of revenue in 2015 and with strong profit margins. As we have discussed in the past, the growth rate of our media business and of the company as a whole is influenced by the revenue that we receive from a few very large customers. Over the last few years, our largest two customers, in particular, have comprised about 13% of Akamai's overall revenue. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect these two accounts to still be our largest media customers and that they will contribute about 6% of our overall revenue. This seven-point change in contribution results from their increased do it yourself or DIY efforts, and it is the main reason we anticipate a lower year-over-year revenue growth rate over the next couple of quarters. It is important to know that the revenue growth from the rest of our customer base remains strong. In addition, we believe that we will exit 2016 with a much more diversified revenue base that will be less subject to future changes in our largest accounts. More importantly, as more video moves online, I believe that there is the opportunity for substantial future growth in our media business, even in the top few accounts where DIY is currently a factor. When performance matters, even the biggest media companies turn to Akamai. That's because it is very hard to replicate our ability to deliver online media with world-class quality, scale and security at an affordable price point. Our many advantages over alternative solutions include our unique approach of streaming content through a global network of 200,000 edge servers located close to end users, which allows us to bypass congested middle mile peering points, resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users. Our superior communication and video transport protocols, which are designed to deliver the kind of higher quality picture that is expected by users and broadcasters alike, and our client-side software, which is now installed on over 100 million devices around the world and designed to greatly improve quality scale while also lowering costs. It is hard to predict how quickly the demand for video services will increase, but as OTT grows, I believe Akamai is in an excellent position to benefit with our ability to deliver broadcast level quality at enormous scale and at an affordable price point. Before turning the call over to Jim, I'd like to cover one last item. Today, we announced an evolution of our organizational structure designed to help us better serve our customers and further accelerate growth by more tightly aligning our teams that build products with those that work day-to-day with our world-class customers. We've made great strides diversifying our product portfolio in recent years, delivering record sales and profitability. And as we close out another excellent year, I believe that our Media and Web Performance and Security businesses are now at the scale where a transition to this type of customer and solution-centric organization makes sense. This change will become effective in Q2, does not involve layoffs, and will not be disruptive for our customers. Indeed, I am looking forward to Akamai becoming even more responsive to our customers' needs and bringing innovative solutions to market at an even faster pace. In summary, I see a very bright and exciting future for Akamai. Our rapidly growing security business has a rich collection of new products in the pipeline. We are well positioned to benefit from the potential of very large volumes of video traffic moving online. We are well ahead of the field when it comes to improving websites and application performance, especially for mobile devices. And we are just beginning to tap into an enterprise security and networking market that could someday be larger than the current market for our web services. This is why, in addition to the three-year $1 billion share repurchase program recently authorized by our board of directors, I plan to enter into a personal 10b5-1 plan to purchase $10 million worth of Akamai stock over the next six months. I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q4 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q1. Jim? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon everyone. As Tom outlined, Akamai had a strong fourth quarter. Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $579 million, up 8% year-over-year or up 11% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $286 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year or up 19% on a constant currency basis and was the sole driver of our revenue overachievement. Our web performance business benefited from a stronger than expected online holiday season, and we continued to see strong growth and demand for our cloud security offerings across all three geographies. Fourth quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $73 million, up 46% year-over-year or up 50% on a constant currency basis. Exiting 2015, our security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $300 million. Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $247 million in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year or up 1% on a constant currency basis and in line with our expectations. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, the moderation in media revenue growth rates was driven by the impact of DIY efforts in our largest two media accounts. However, the rest of our media business grew over 10% compared to a very strong Q4 of 2014. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $46 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year or up 21% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see strong new customer attachments rates for our higher end, enterprise class professional services globally. Turning now to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 28% of total revenue in Q4, up one point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $163 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year or up 27% on a constant currency basis. The stronger dollar continued to weigh on growth rates and had a negative impact on revenue of nearly $14 million on a year-over-year basis and $1 million on a sequential basis. On a constant currency basis, we continued to see solid growth in both our Asia-Pacific and EMEA markets. Revenue from our U.S. market was $416 million, up 5% year-over-year. Our two largest media accounts reside in the U.S. and heavily weighed on the U.S. market's results. Outside of these two accounts, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the U.S. business. And finally, revenue through channel partners represented 27% of total revenue in Q4. Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q3, down 2 points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, consistent with the prior quarter, down 3 points from the same period last year, and about a point higher than our guidance due to the revenue overachievement. GAAP operating expenses were $263 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $211 million, up $7 million from Q3 levels and at the higher end of our guidance. We continue to balance investments in the business with a near-term moderation in revenue growth rates. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $238 million, up $16 million from Q3 levels, and up $6 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41%, up 1 point from Q3 levels, down 2 points from the same period last year, and at the high end of our guidance. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $80 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $70 million, up $5 million from Q3 levels, and slightly above our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $168 million, up $11 million from Q3, and down $7 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, consistent with Q3 levels, and down 4 points from the same period last year, and a point higher than our guidance. Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the fourth quarter was about $3 million, consistent with Q3 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $88 million, or $0.49 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $129 million, or $0.72 of earnings per diluted share, $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. Our better-than-expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues, improved efficiency, and a $0.06 benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit in December, which was not included in our guidance. Without the benefit of the R&D tax credit, we generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.66 per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $32 million, based on an effective tax rate of 27%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $42 million, based on an effective tax rate of 24% and coming in about 6 points lower than our guidance range, again, due to the R&D tax credit. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 180 million shares, consistent with Q3 levels and in line with our guidance. Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was 59 days, consistent with Q3 levels. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $89 million, and slightly above our guidance for the quarter. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities. Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Free cash flow was $139 million in the fourth quarter, or 24% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very strong, with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $800 million. During the quarter, we spent $100 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.7 million shares. For the year, we spent $300 million, buying back 4.5 million shares. As Tom mentioned, we are pleased to announce that our board has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program running from now until the end of 2018. As we've discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, this new authorization is intended to continue our multi-year capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions. In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and throughout 2015, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of growth for the company. Looking ahead to Q1, as a result of the lower volume from our top two accounts and normal Q4 to Q1 seasonality patterns, we are expecting Q1 revenue in the range of $554 million to $570 million. At the midpoint of this range, revenue growth would be 8%, adjusted for foreign exchange movements over a very strong first quarter last year. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue of $1 million sequentially and $5 million compared to Q1 of last year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 65% to 66%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $201 million to $206 million. As I mentioned earlier, we have purposefully slowed down the rate and pace of head count additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations. But, we are continuing to make prudent investments in the business that we believe are necessary to support sustained long-term growth and scale. Factoring in all these items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 40% to 41%. And as I have been messaging in prior calls, we will strive to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. But as a reminder, maintaining EBITDA margins at 40% to 41% will be heavily dependent on several factors including revenue, volumes, possible M&A and spending on platform capacity in anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services. Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $71 million to $73 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 28% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.61 to $0.64. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $46 million to $48 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 178 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $85 million to $95 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. Of course, we will continue to balance network investment against future revenue opportunity and continued network efficiency initiatives. In closing, we accomplished a great deal in 2015 and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and future trends in the industry at our upcoming Investor Summit in Boston on March 7. Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate you taking the question. So, I guess if you guys could maybe go over a little bit with us with regard to the two customers going from 13% down to 6%. Could you maybe characterize for us how that lines up with perhaps the way you were thinking about those revenue levels maybe a quarter or two ago? And maybe another way to think about it is if that revenue is getting cut in half, where do you see that revenue being made up at this point? And can you talk about perhaps some of the relative strength between media performance and also the Cloud Security business in that regard? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. So just to be clear that the \u2013 the 13% reference is on average what we've received from these top two customers. So it wasn't exactly the percentage of business that we had in the fourth quarter. So this has been gliding down slowly for the company. And as we said that we expect next year it'll be roughly 6%, it could be a little bit more than that, could be a little bit less than that, depending upon how we see traffic volumes. But we're very, very pleased with the performance, in general, of our Media business, that our Media business outside these two customers grew 10% is very, very healthy. I would say that these customers have been doing DIY for a while, and they do serve a fair amount of their traffic themselves, so depending up traffic volumes for their businesses, we'll serve more or less traffic. But I'd say this is kind of, in general, aligned with our expectations. That, I think, in particular what's going to fill this up, I think you're going to go through a period where as their revenues glide down to roughly 6% of our total revenues for the company, one, we're much more diversified in our portfolio from a customer perspective because there isn't \u2013 customers three and four and below that are not even nearly close to the size of these customers, and these customers combined are only going to represent 6%. So the revenue concentration is significantly less. There's significant opportunity for growth, as I mentioned, in the Media business, that the Media business is very healthy in aggregate. We believe that more and more content is going to move online, video content in particular, that will fuel growth. We \u2013 our Security business grew 54% in 2015 and that it was only a few years ago \u2013 four years ago that business was just a few million dollars. So to go from a few million dollars four years ago to a business now that has an annualized run rate of $300 million is a huge opportunity for growth in security. And there's an opportunity for growth in other aspects of the business as well. So I think those are the many pillars of growth that we think will fuel the company; media, security, web performance and some of the new emerging areas that Tom outlined. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : And then maybe as a quick follow-up, if I may. When we had you on the road, Jim, you talked a lot about some of the contract renegotiations with some of your large customers. Typically contract renegotiations have a negative connotation to them, but to the contrary, you were speaking very positively with regard to some of those endeavors. Can you share with us a little bit how those efforts are going, to the extent you can? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I mean, we always go through contract renewals with customers every quarter. I think what you're referring to is, obviously, each customer is unique and the way you structure contracts with customers depends upon the circumstances for that customer. And so I'd say there's nothing unique other than making sure that the contract structure is in the best interest of Akamai and the customer. And so we make sure that we do that. Sometimes that means structuring contracts differently than the way they're currently structured, but I don't think there's anything notable to talk about for any particular customer. Every customer is unique and I think we try to come up with a solution for each customer when we work with them to make sure it's something that works for them and for Akamai. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Maybe just a very quick follow-up. In the context of new competition coming into the space, do you still feel like Akamai has sufficient leverage in these renegotiations of the contracts so that these renegotiations will be overall favorable in the pricing construct of those contracts? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Are you talking about for the customers \u2013 the top two customers, or just in general? Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Well, I guess the answer would be yes. To both. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I mean \u2013 again, I'm not going to get into any specific customer renewal situation. I would say that \u2013 yeah, I think you certainly know that we are by far the largest provider and the best provider of content delivery services kind of globally. And so in that regard, I think we have a lot of leverage with our customers. But we try to make sure that when we negotiate with our customers, we're negotiating something that works for them and works for Akamai. And so I think that's going to be the case. I think we'll continue to have good leverage and I think we try to make sure it's a win-win for both of us. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. All right, Michael, thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. Could you give us a little bit more color on the cloud \u2013 sorry, the Performance and Security business? This is one of the strongest quarters I think you've had. Is the sales productivity improving? Is the integration with enterprise (29:43) internal basis is improving, or any other color would be helpful, guys. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And I can start with that, maybe Tom can offer any color if he wants. But, yeah, we had a very, very good quarter in Performance and Security. Grew 19%, but it grew 19% in Q3 as well, so we've been growing the Performance and Security business in the high teens all year. So again, very solid performance. And, as I mentioned, we had very, very good performance in the fourth quarter; one, we saw an acceleration in our Cloud Security offerings \u2013 in Solutions, so those grew 54% year-over-year. We had a very strong online holiday season in the commerce space, so we had a good performance in web performance as well. So, again, I think that that category has certainly been the fastest grower for the company and it certainly, as Tom mentioned, the largest category for the company now. So I think there's a lot of room for growth in that category. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, the strong performance we saw in Q4 is all around our existing solutions, Kona Site Defender and Prolexic, our flagship offerings, and I think what's really exciting is when you look at the roadmap of new solutions coming out, and then later this year as we enter the enterprise security space that that creates the potential to really continue the very strong growth of security solutions well into the future. Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hey, good afternoon. Along those same lines, is the upside there in security that is coming from faster uptake of security within existing customer base or is it faster ramp of kind of selling your security offerings to non-Akamai customers? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's both. We have a large customer base that can really benefit from our security solutions, and security is also a great lead offer into certain verticals that may not have already bought our acceleration services. So both, I would say, are doing well. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. And then could you describe on the media side why or why not your other media customers outside of those top two customers would be able to do similar DIY build-outs and kind of less than how Akamai fits into their future media delivery needs? In other words, why would that happen or not happen outside of these major two customers? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think there's only a very small handful of customers that can even really think about doing it. We've been competing against DIY now for 15 years and through that time, there's only a handful that have gone there. Generally, we compete successfully and in my opinion, probably doesn't even make sense for them to be doing it. And ultimately I think that they discover that as Akamai continues to improve its capabilities that we'll do a better job at a lower price point. So I don't think this is something that goes broader than the few customers who do it today, and even there, I'm optimistic about our future in those accounts. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is now open. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Following up on that question, could you talk about the timing that you expect at this point with OTT, and is there a risk that OTT will be dominated by a handful, as you put it, of customers so you get sort of an oligopoly effect? So even if it doesn't spread much beyond the current customers doing DIY, that if there's three to five that do it, that's basically a lot of the market and hurts your media growth over time. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, the timing is really hard to predict, first, when the various offers will come out, and then how popular they will be. So that's just \u2013 it's hard to know. Our goal and job is to be out in front of it so that we're ready. And, as you know, last year we did purchase some CapEx in advance of what we thought would be a real strong influx of OTT. That didn't take place the way we thought. I think over-the-top will be dominated by a relatively small number of major entities; broadcasters, carriers, media giants. I think we have great relationships with pretty much all of those folks and we're in a very good position to benefit as OTT increases. And, of course, OTT is a situation where people are really paying for it. The quality needs to be really good and that's a situation where the big folks really tend to turn to Akamai. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Do you still believe in the 17% compound growth rate to $5 billion in 2020? Is that still a reasonable goal? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: You know, we've achieved that over the last three years. We are still working hard to get to $5 billion by 2020. Obviously, our projected growth rates for early this year are less than that. That makes it harder to reach the goal, and of course, the foreign currency situation with the strengthening dollar slows us down. But \u2013 so we're working hard to get there. Is it possible it'd be a year or two late? Of course. But we are striving to get to $5 billion, and I am confident that we can do that. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. Wanted to start with \u2013 I'm a little confused. Last quarter, the commentary around the top customers was focused around the top three customers. And the qualitative commentary was that customer number two and customer number three were of similar size. Now you're saying it's top two, and number one and number two are a far cry from where number three is. What happened to customer number three to have the commentary change? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I think that in Q4, what was going on was the growth was impacted in Q4 by the top three customers. Customer number three does a very, very modest amount of DIY, and so that was a different kind of dynamic that was going on with customer number three. We had gone through previously a contract renewal with them, so it was less a DIY play and certainly only a one quarter phenomenon. Not going to persist into 2016, and if we conveyed that customer two and three were of the same size, then my apologies because that's certainly not the case. Customers one and two are certainly much larger than customers two and three. Customers two and three just to give you - Unknown Speaker : Three and four. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : \u2013 between 2% and 3%, and below that, no customer is more than 1%. So our concentration is actually fairly limited, just to give you a little bit more color on that. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, and based on the trends that you're seeing within those top two customers, I understand you're only giving guidance for the March quarter, but I think a lot of us are trying to think about the model and the shape of the seasonality and the impacts from these trends. Would you expect the growth rate to trough second quarter or third quarter? Is there any visibility around that? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we don't specifically guide. You're right. We're only guiding for the quarter, but we did try to provide some helpful information for you without giving you a specific guide. And specifically what Tom talked about is we expect that we're going to see growth moderation for the next couple quarters. And I'll leave it to you to understand what you think a couple quarters is. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, last question. Under the new structure, I'm kind of curious \u2013 I think it makes sense in terms of the efficiency on the go to market, but when you think about the development and the management of the infrastructure, what's different here versus other enterprise software is you have that shared infrastructure of the Akamai network. How are you going to manage the prioritization of upgrades as well as modifications to the Akamai network that you may have a little bit of a tug of war between what the Media side wants to do versus Performance and Security? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, great question. Our platform organization, which includes development, deployment of resources and so forth, is not changing during the reorganization. We have already figured out how to handle the problem you suggest where the Media division needs to update some software for video delivery, the Security team wants to make a new product and get that out there. And it's all riding on the same platform. So we have already had, on the development side, a partition of those resources into business units with product teams. And so that won't change. We figured out how to do that management, and that will continue on the same way. The difference here, with this next step in our organizational evolution, is that we're aligning our go-to-market resources directly with the product and development resources in these areas. And the platform organization stays the same. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Great, thanks for taking the questions. I guess I'd like to ask a little bit about what's going on around sort of the cloud side. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that scaling enterprise networks to handle growing cloud workloads was something that was one of your big goals. And I know that you recently initiated a partnership with Microsoft. And I'm just wondering if you could take us up to speed on what's going on with that relationship and sort of what we might look for in the future around this? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, the partnership with Microsoft has several components. I think you're referring to the part with Azure, where if you have applications running on Azure, you'll be able to check the box, and deploy Akamai whole site delivery for whatever you're doing with Azure. And I think that's a great step forward for us. Microsoft will also be reselling our services. Now when I talk about the grand challenges, the beginning, there I'm talking more about a business that we're just beginning to get into, and that is focused on the enterprise network. How an enterprise communicates with employees and branch offices. How you manage enterprise security to protect employees from phishing attacks or a malware that gets in and steals corporate e-mails and then exfiltrates that data. We're not really doing that yet today, but that's where we are headed. We had our first really toe in the water there in partnerships with Riverbed and Cisco. And we've recently announced partnerships with a couple of major European carriers, Orange and T-Systems, but there's going to be a lot of focus as we move forward on developing capabilities for the enterprise network, and that's different than what we do today for websites and applications, which tend to be more enterprise out as opposed to enterprise employees. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : That makes sense. Let me ask one follow-up if I may. Just based in terms of our research, even as workloads are making a way into those cloud platforms, people are initially being willing to go there through the public Internet. Obviously that has a lot of issues, and two of them are security and performance, both of which Akamai can address. In your opinion, do you think sort of the driver for folks to come to Akamai and work with you on these cloud applications will be the security side or will it be the performance side? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Both. As you care about performance and you care about security, you're absolutely right in what you said. And I think that drives our business forward. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Thank you for taking the questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Yeah, hi Tom, Jim. Solid results here. Good news on the buyback. I have a question for both of you. The first question would be for Tom. Would be \u2013 the Summer Olympics, the U.S. Election, and some of these other major events on the planet, would these help to meaningfully ramp over the top video traffic volumes in your media business or would the impact be more incremental? And then also help us understand in terms of any forward visibility you're getting. Are any of your media customers looking to sign up contracts, capacity agreements, et cetera, to deliver any of these Internet events at scale to the Akamai global platform? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, we carry most all the major events in most all the major countries in the world. We do derive revenue from those events. Even years, you have more of those events and they tend to be better years for our media business. And perhaps more fundamentally, those events, particularly things like the Olympics, there tends to be changes in the ecosystem. Fancier TVs, this Olympics will have a lot of 4K involved. And so new technologies get demonstrated. And that tends to have a more long-lasting effect. For example, if a lot of folks went and bought 4K TVs, such that they liked it, got used to it, but then a lot of the content that's more day-to-day going forward, you can imagine using that kind of capability, and that creates a lot more traffic and more business for Akamai. So I think there is a more modest, short-term impact. And yes, we do go get, make sure we have capacity and sign up deals for all these events. That is good for the media business. But sometimes you also get a little longer lasting effect afterwards. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. A quick follow-on for Jim would be what steps you might be taking to systematically improve free cash flow generation? I've been speaking with quite a few clients recently. They see around a 6% cash flow yield in the stock. How would you benchmark free cash flow generation versus your software Internet peers? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think it's obviously every company is a little bit different and unique. Certainly from a free cash flow, we generate a substantial free cash flow. We've been in kind of the mid-to-high teens from a free cash flow perspective that some years it's going to be a little bit lower than that if we invest more in network CapEx to build out a network, which is hopefully going to be for revenue that we expect in the future. But I think generally speaking, the kind of the model that we've outlined is a model that is kind of low 40s EBITDA. CapEx in the 16% to 18% range. And then you can calculate obviously the free cash flow from that. And I think relative to certainly our peer group in the CDN industry, no one's even close to our financial model. And then relative to others that are in the software and services industry, again all companies are a little bit differently, but I think we fare reasonably well for companies that need to do build-out of their network like we do, so I think that we have a very, very strong business model as a company. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks to both of you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. The organizational split that you announced, does that put the company in better position to formally split into two legal entities if it so chose? And do you foresee a situation where that actually might make sense? And then, as part of that question, if you're now kind of aligning the parts of the cost structure leading to each of those two buckets, although I appreciate the comments you made about the platform staying as one, will you be in a position to better see visibility on what EBITDA is for each of those two businesses and do you foresee potentially breaking that out for us as well? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me take the first question. We have absolutely no intention of splitting the company. And it wouldn't make sense to do that. And though the key point there of course is the platform, which is common and which is a huge advantage for us, both in terms of the economics and the performance and also the scale. Our security solutions, our acceleration solutions, and our video delivery solutions all ride on the same platform. Our media customers buy all of those from us. So there's no intention to split up the company. And I'll let Jim talk about EBITDA and reporting. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so I think you know, Colby, that we try to provide you guys some color annually anyway around what the EBITDA profile is of our Media business, our Performance and Security business, and our Service and Support business. So I think we already provided that to you that as far as now splitting these up, as Tom mentioned, really what we're doing, remember, is we're taking kind of the product management, product marketing, product development engineering, and kind of sales and marketing side. But that's not the entire company. It's a very, very large kind of organization and platform, and there's other organizations as well. So we will continue to provide annually a view for you around what these divisions look like and I'll probably \u2013 while it remains to be seen, we'll have to see at the upcoming investor summit what exactly we share in this construct that we're not moving into this model until Q2, so it's probably a little premature to provide visibility, but I already do provide visibility around EBITDA in the current business construct, and this really isn't fundamentally different than that other than what we're doing is we're integrating the product teams with the go-to-market teams into one team. We think it's going to drive better kind of customer-centric solutions and kind of faster response timing for customers. So I think in that regard, it's more \u2013 the goal of it is really to improve execution. It's not necessarily to kind of change the way we're reporting the business. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. And if I can just get one quick follow-up then. Obviously, the stock, like the broader market, has been under pressure of late. Can you see yourself pulling forward some of your stock buyback similar to, I guess, the announcement that Tom himself is going to be investing in the stock over the next six months to offset the stock comp, which is your goal? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so, that's why I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, that certainly the primary goal of our buyback program is to offset dilution from equity grant. So that will continue to be the primary goal of the program. But the way the program is set up is that we will opportunistically buy back more, depending upon where the stock price trades and depending upon business and market conditions. So you can expect that if the stock price is trading low relative to kind of general market that we will end up buying back more shares. But it's an opportunistic program and I'd say that's the secondary benefit of the program, it's not the primary benefit of the program. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair. Your line is now open. James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Tom or Jim, I was just wondering if you could give us a little color around the international portion of the business and I think last quarter you had a pretty good growth rate outside the U.S. And then maybe just your thoughts on as you look at some of these larger customers doing it themselves, do you think there's a greater or less potential for that to happen outside the U.S. given some of the geographic challenges? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll start with the last question. We don't see really do it yourself outside the U.S. It's really only in literally a handful of giant U.S. media companies. So it's really not an issue there. In fact, it probably gets even harder outside the U.S. to try to attempt that. Our international business, our EMEA business and APJ business are growing at very strong clips. Of course, that's where we get the most impact from the strengthened dollar. So you don't see the percentage of our overall revenue growing as fast as it would otherwise. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, our international business grew 27%, so it's growing in the mid-20%s. So we're very, very pleased with the performance in both the European markets and our Asian markets. James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jack Kilgallen - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, this is Jack Kilgallen, filling in for Heather. Thanks for taking the question. The first one you made the comment that excluding those top two customers, the rest of the Media segment grew 10%. I was just wondering, A, if you could give a little bit of color on how that metric has been trending, and B, if you could also give some color on like the price volume dynamics that underlie that 10%? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think as we shared before, the Media business tends to have variability based on traffic volumes and pushing traffic and price points. And so I'd say we had a huge Q4 of 2014. We had a record number of gaming releases, software download releases. So the fact that we grew 10% over that, we were very, very pleased. There are some quarters where it does grow more than that, but that's when you have notably more gaming releases and notably more software downloads, but I say it is a very, very good quarter for Q4 outside of those two customers. And what was your second question? Jack Kilgallen - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Pricing. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Oh, pricing. The pricing dynamic that we said with Media for some time is, it remains a very competitive market, which means you have to offer competitive price points. But the rate and pace of pricing, so pricing declines do happen. They happen annually. We track them, track them religiously and kind of the rate and pace of pricing declines has been very consistent over the last several years. Jack Kilgallen - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, and then if I could just get one more. You talked about cloud security, but the ad performance and acceleration business, they grew 11% constant currency this quarter, which was in line with the last quarter. Is there any reason if that were to accelerate on a year-over-year basis, I guess what would be the drivers there? I know the lower growth rate, I know you'd cited that the security products were getting a lot of sales force's attention. Is there anything else you are seeing there maybe in terms of competition that you can shed some light on? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we were very, very pleased with \u2013 like as I mentioned, we had a very good online commerce season. Seasonally, you have a good online commerce season, the web acceleration business will do well. And we had a good online commerce season, which is why it grew 11%. That business admittedly in years past has grown faster than that. That business has the potential to accelerate and grow faster, but because it's a subscription-oriented business, effectively deals you book this year tend to be revenue next year. And so I don't think you are going to expect kind of a significant reacceleration in that business any time soon. I do think there is significant opportunity. I think that there's work being done by the engineering teams to increase the pace of innovation and start to offer adjacent products and also improve the existing products. So I think there is a lot of potential on that business, but that business has been growing in kind of the low-double digits. It has been decelerating slightly. It is true that when you have an offering like security that's been growing at 50%, was relatively new for the sales force. It's gotten significant mind share. We've gotten significant traction. It has taken a little bit of way from the web performance business, but I think there is still good opportunity for that business to grow, and I think it's up to us to execute now. Jack Kilgallen - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys, good evening, couple of questions on Media also. First of all, on 1Q, it seems that way based on what you guided in terms of modeling, but are we back to what we think of as normal quarter-over-quarter seasonality in the Media business after a flattish 4Q? So should I think of a normal kind of couple of percent down? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Michael, I don't know what normal is at times in the media business (55:23). Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Well, just statistically similar to the prior years' discount (55:24), what I mean. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, the Media business declined last year kind of Q4 to Q1 sequentially, so we're certainly \u2013 we're implying from this guide that it's going to sequentially decline this year. There have been years past, though, that Q4 to Q1 the media business has grown, so that's why I said \u2013 I can't say that there's more seasonality patterns in the non-media businesses than there are in the media businesses where those businesses do tend to show sequential declines, I'm talking about organically, largely because of the online commerce season that I mentioned that you don't have that in the first quarter. But I'd say for Media, what you saw in the guide is that as we mentioned, these top two accounts are going to weigh on growth rates kind of here in the near term. But I'd say outside of those two customers, if there is something that's normal, it's going to behave more like it did last year. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right, but in other words, do we still have an out-sized sequential impact from those two, or is that kind of getting normal patterns off of 4Q that where we took the big hit? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I mean we're going to see a step down in volumes in these top two accounts as well from Q4 to Q1. Are they going to be just the same magnitude that they were from Q3 to Q4? We'll see, but you will see a similar step down in revenue volumes from Q4 to Q1 in these large accounts. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then the next question, and I know it's hard to look out, but how do you think about if you're going from 13% of revs to 6% of revs roughly for those two top two into 2016, what's your sense of confidence relative to the longer term? Do you feel like they're stabilized or should we think about those as declining businesses for you long term, those top two? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I would view this as probably stabilizing, hard to really predict into 2017. I think there's plenty of potential for actually upside there, especially if there's real progress in video over the top with these customers. So I would say there's more upside than downside. And the very worst possible case, it's only 6% of revenue. And so we are very diversified, and I like that position because now you have some giants that at only a total of 6% of revenue could really grow from there and help reaccelerate the business going forward. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks Tom, thanks Jim. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So your server count really spiked in 2015, and I'm guessing that is anticipation of future traffic growth at some point this year. How should we think about those investments going forward? And then what kind of visibility do you have on initiatives that could drive traffic growth higher at some point in 2016? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I mean I'll take the server count. I mean obviously, we look at network CapEx. And as you can imagine, we're doing deployments in the U.S., outside the U.S. And as we talked about in 2015, we did begin to forward bill for what we thought was going to be the potential of an over-the-top offering. And so you could think of it as that the network \u2013 you have to build the network out three months to six months in advance, and so we built that out. It's fair to say we haven't monetized that here in the near term, and you'll grow into that here in 2016. We spent a little bit more as a percent of revenue in 2015 than we normally do. We normally spend kind of, call it, 8%, 8.5% of revenue on network CapEx, and we spent about 10% of revenue on network CapEx, but that's above our model. We think the model is more in the kind of 8%, 8.5% range and we'll probably be back at those levels in 2016. And as Tom mentioned around what's going to reaccelerate Media, I think we talked about what those things are. I think there is significant opportunity for growth in Media outside of these two accounts. We do believe one catalyst for growth in the media business is as more and more premium content moves online, it's poised to push a lot more traffic online, and we believe that we're in a good position to benefit from that when that happens. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, in terms of the visibility question, I think we probably have as good visibility as it's possible to have. And that said \u2013 but it's hard to predict the future. And there's I think things that happen or don't happen that are even beyond the industry to really know for sure. We got caught a little bit last year with that. We and a lot of other folks had very good reason to believe that there was going to be the good possibility of a large influx in OTT traffic. That did not take place. So generally, I'd say our visibility is very good. We are very well connected with all of the major players, but it's not perfect. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. That's helpful. And then I just want to make sure I have something correct from a modeling perspective. You may have already touched on this already. How much of the impact from your top two customers going from 13% of revenue to 6% is actually hitting in Q1? Is it all hitting in Q1 or does it phase in over the next two or three quarters? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, as we mentioned, 13% is kind of, call it, what is average over the last few years. It's been coming down, so in Q4 it was not at \u2013 it was lower than 13%. And as Tom mentioned that we think that you're going to see it come down probably through the middle part of 2016, and then we'll have to see, our expectation is that we think it may stabilize from there. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Hi, this is Rishi Jaluria, dialing in for Greg McDowell. Thank you for taking my questions. So first, you discussed your strong e-commerce season that you had over the holiday season, and I believe it was IBM that said that almost 60% of Internet shopping came from mobile devices. Just wondering what sort of impact have you seen from this shift of Internet traffic to mobile devices? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we saw very similar statistics. I think our statistics were just a little bit less. That could be with our customer mix. We do carry almost all the major commerce sites on our platform, but mobile is certainly increasing its penetration. We're putting a lot of effort into improving mobile performance. Mobile performance is more challenged obviously than desktop performance, especially if you are using a cellular network. There is a lot of interest in our commerce customers and our customer base as a whole in mobile site performance and mobile app performance. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Got it. Got it. Okay. And then you've seen some impressive growth from your cloud security business. There aren't really many cloud security players out there with $300 million in annual revenue. Just as you have gone to this sort of scale and you continue to grow at this relatively high clip, do you anticipate that you are going to start running into bigger competitors, especially as they kind of take notice of this big growing business? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think there's a lot of folks interested in the security business. There's giant security companies that license software or sell you hardware. We come at it from really a different approach where we have built a fantastic platform that we can use in a multi-tenant way to provide excellent security with excellent performance in a very easy-to-consume manner. And there the big folks don't know how to do that. We have got a great head start there and we've got 15 years of experience operating in that kind of platform. So there are just lots of customers for us to go and sign up, and it's up to us to execute there. A plenty of competition all around, but in cloud security, we have a very good value proposition. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then last question, I'll jump off. But I see your investor summit's next month. We're excited to be there. Just in terms of giving us an idea of what to expect out of it, do you think it's going to be like it's been in the past years, or given this reorganization that you will be doing in Q2, should we maybe be expecting a couple of new things out of it? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think you'll find it to be similar to past years. So I don't think you see any fundamental differences. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Okay, great. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : There'll be a free lunch. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Free lunch. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Fantastic. I'll be there. Thank you so much, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you guys for squeezing me in. I just wanted to revisit the realignment of the business. Just to get a sort of clear understanding of the directionality of sort of why you're putting the change into place. And maybe it'd be helpful if you can walk us through a couple of examples of the type of stuff you're expecting to be able to do with the new alignment that you couldn't do with the old alignment to help us understand as to the reason why. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think whenever you bring the customer closer to the developer, you get a better result. You make better products. You make them faster. Innovation gets in the customer's hands faster. You're more efficient. And that's what we're trying to accomplish here. We are getting the folks that work day-to-day with customers lined up right next to the developers that make the products for them. As you could imagine, there's a very high correlation between the revenue we get from media customers and the revenue we get from our media products. And on the other side of the house, a very strong correlation from between the revenue we get from, say, banks and commerce sites as customers and the revenue we get from our application acceleration and web security products. So by bringing those teams together, I think we will be more responsive to our customers and more efficient overall, and I think it helps us accelerate growth. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And there's no cost saving angle or sort of consolidation of functionality, it's just creating different lines of communication amongst the various components of the businesses. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's right. I think you want to view this as cost neutral. We weren't doing this in terms of absolutely saving dollars. We're not doing a big layoff here. But I do expect us to be a lot more efficient and I do expect that to help us ultimately on the bottom line for the company. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And is there any execution risk involved in terms of people have sort of different \u2013 like, do account coverages change at all or the way you address the customers change at all? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, and that's important. We put a lot of effort into that as we planned this realignment. I think we have less than 0.5% of our customers that will have any change in their account team. I think 96% of the reps still have exactly the same territory. And that's probably more than you might even see in a typical year. So there's not really any disruption on the customer side, it's just that those teams will have their management changed now side-by-side with the developer management change and so I think you'll see us be more effective as a result. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So this can almost be thought as more strategic in nature than sort of feet on the ground in nature. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Correct. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Operator, we have time for one more. We're running a little bit long. So let's take one more question, please. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Will Power with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I recognize it sounds like the pressure at your top two customers is you think principally due to do-it-yourself efforts. But I wonder if you could comment on what you are seeing more broadly in the media delivery business competitively from the likes of Amazon, Level 3, EdgeCast and the private players out there, et cetera. Any sense of share loss or any sense of changing dynamics on that front that may be pressuring the business? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, not really. We've got dozens of competitors in the media space. We always have, we always will. There is so much potential in that space that you're going to have a lot of competitors. I think we compete very effectively. I'm not aware of any significant share loss there. I think the only fundamental shift there really has been with the big carriers, and basically I'd say the shift has been more towards standardizing on Akamai. I think you look back four years or five years ago, most of the world's major carriers had some kind of DIY effort to build their own CDN to compete with Akamai. Maybe they bought a lot of equipment from one of the big box manufacturers, and today most of the world's major carriers are pretty much standardizing on Akamai. Obviously, Verizon an exception there having purchased EdgeCast, we compete with that. I've said Verizon is still a very large reseller for Akamai. Level 3 of course competes, always has. But the list is not long in terms of the carriers. The cloud providers, some of them partner with us, some of them have competing services, but we're not seeing erosion due to competition. We got two large customers that are built off more on their own internal effort. We have not lost business to competitors there. So I think we're in a very good position on the competitive front. Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Thank you, Tom. Thank you, everyone, and thank you. In closing, as Jim mentioned, we hope to see you at either live or via webcast through the Akamai platform at our 2016 Investor Summit to be held here on March 7 in Boston. In addition, we will be presenting at a number of investor conferences in both February and March. And details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. So thank you for joining us, and have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Thank you, and good afternoon for joining \u2013 thank you for joining us on Akamai's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. But before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on April 26, 2016. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, let me please turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us. Q1 was a very solid quarter for Akamai and both the top and bottom lines. Revenue in the first quarter was $568 million, up 8% year-over-year, and up 9% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Excluding the contribution from our two largest customers, revenue in the first quarter was up 15% over Q1 of 2015. Our strong revenue achievement was driven by the continued robust demand for our security services, which grew 47% in constant currency over the first quarter of last year, as well as solid performance across all of our major product lines and geographies. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.66 per diluted share, up 8% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range due to our strong revenue achievement and our continued focus on efficiency across the company. Our solid performance in Q1 has gotten us off to an excellent start for the year. I was particularly pleased to see our continued strong execution during the time when we were realigning the company. As a result of the realignment, we now have three major divisions; Media, Lab and Enterprise and Carrier. Each division has its own resources for development, product management, marketing and sales. For example, the Media Division is developing products focused on video and software delivery, and they manage our customers and prospects in the media, software, social networking, and gaming verticals. The Web Division is responsible for developing our web security and application acceleration products. And they manage customers and prospects in verticals such as e-commerce, financial services, software-as-a-service, and the public sector. The Enterprise and Carrier Division is responsible for developing products for enterprise and carrier networks and enterprise security. And they manage our carrier relationships. Going forward, we will report the revenue for each division in terms of the revenue derived from customers in that division. For continuity purposes, we will also continue to provide the product-based view of revenue that we have historically reported. Jim will provide all of this data for Q1 shortly. But first, I would like to mention some of the recent highlights from the Media and Web Divisions. It's been an exciting start to the year for the Media Division, with record-breaking online audiences for major events such as the Super Bowl and March Madness. 4 million viewers watched the Super Bowl online this year, up from 2.5 million in 2015. The average bit rate was up 30% to 4.5 megabits per second in 2016, and the average viewing time was up 20% to over 100 minutes. We also delivered a major golf tournament in the new 4K format a few weeks ago. This was the first time that a major U.S. sporting event has been delivered in 4K online. The quality levels were extraordinary. Using our Octoshape Client technology, we delivered an average bit rate of 13 megabits per second, with a rebuffering rate of less than 1%, showing once again Akamai's ability to deliver broadcast quality content reliably and securely. The excellent end user experience that we are providing with our advanced video delivery capabilities was a major topic of discussion at the recent National Association of Broadcasters, or NAB Show. That's because the ability to deliver high-quality video at scale is critical to the enablement of over-the-top, or OTT, services. A common theme in my conversations with many of the world's leading broadcasters and media companies at the show was that they greatly value our ability to provide such high quality and scale, and to do so with a very high level of reliability. It is very difficult to replicate our ability to deliver online media with world-class quality, scale, and security. That's because of our unique approach of streaming content through a global network of more than 200,000 edge servers located close to end users, which allows us to bypass congested middle mile peering points, resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users. Our superior communication and video transport protocols, which are designed to deliver the kind of higher-quality picture that is desired by viewers and broadcasters alike. Our client side software, which is now installed on over 100 million devices around the world, and designed to greatly improve quality and scale, while also lowering cost. And our new 24/7 Broadcast Operations Control Center, or BOCC, capability for end to end monitoring of quality and fast resolution of performance issues. I'm pleased to report that our BOCC is already receiving national accolades for the level of service that it can provide to our broadcast customers. At NAB, the BOCC was selected as TV Technology's Best of Show for its design, features, cost efficiency and performance. The BOCC also won Streaming Media's Best of NAB 2016, one of only six awards the publication presented from among the 1,600-plus exhibitors at the show. Of course, it's hard to predict how fast the OTT market will grow, but we believe that we are very well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for high-quality video online. There are also some exciting developments to report from our Web Division. Most notably, our new Bot Manager service became generally available earlier this month. Bot Manager identifies over 1,200 (7:53) types of bots, and enables our customers to customize their response to request based on the bot type. For example, one of our government customers recently deployed Bot Manager to thwart malicious entities that were checking on the validity of stolen account names and passwords. Using Bot Manager, they were able to automatically report passwords as being invalid, when we detected that a bot was making the request instead of a human, thereby preventing the fraudulent use of stolen identities. I'm also pleased to report that we now have over 1,000 Ion customers. As you may recall, we launched Ion a little over three years ago, and it has since become the leading solution for accelerating websites and applications online. Ion is particularly well-suited for accelerating mobile apps and content being delivered to mobile devices. This is important because the mobile environment is often much slower than the desktop environment. Users expect mobile devices to be fast, and over half of all transactions on the Akamai platform now come from mobile devices. Before turning the call over to Jim, I would like to emphasize that although we have a new divisional structure, Akamai's goal remains the same as it has always been : to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure. And we are still laser-focused on solving four grand challenges for our customers : delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale, and affordability; providing near instant performance for websites and apps on any device anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyber-attacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data, or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to handle growing cloud workloads efficiently and securely. We believe that we will continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds such as the increasing amount of video being consumed online, the rapid proliferation of mobile devices, the growing need for cloud-based security solutions and the continued migration of enterprise applications to the cloud. And we are continuing to invest in the growth of the business. I believe that our new divisional structure will enable us to be even more responsive to our customers' needs and to bring new capabilities to market at an even faster pace than before. In summary, Akamai is off to a strong start in 2016, and I'm very excited about the substantial opportunities for growth that lie ahead. I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q1 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q2. Jim? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Tom and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom outlined and as we previewed at the investor summit in March, we are now managing the business in our new division structure. In an effort to make this transition as clear and transparent as possible, in addition to providing our results through this new division lens, we will continue to provide you with our financial results by the solution categories we have historically shared. Looking to top-line performance, Akamai had a strong first quarter and is off to a good start in 2016. Q1 revenue came in near the high end of our guidance range at $568 million, up 8% year-over-year or up 9% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds, and growth outside of our top two customers continued to be strong, up 15% in constant currency. Turning to our solution categories, revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $316 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year or up 17% on a constant currency basis. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across the major product lines and we continued to see significant growth and demand for our Cloud Security offerings. First quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $81 million, up 46% year-over-year or up 47% on a constant currency basis. We are pleased with how well our unique and differentiated Cloud Security capabilities are being adopted by our customers and being recognized in the marketplace. Our Bot Manager offering is a latest example of how we are innovating to expand our security portfolio to meet strong customer demand. Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $206 million in the quarter, down 4% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. As we have previously mentioned, Media revenues continue to be impacted by DIY efforts in two of our largest Media customers; however, the rest of our Media business grew over 11% compared to a very strong Q1 of 2015. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $46 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year. We continue to see strong new customer attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise class professional services globally. Turning now to our new division view, as we shared in our last call, we are now managing the company in a new division structure which integrates the development, product management, marketing and sales teams into three divisions to focus on the company's Media, Web, and Enterprise and Carrier products and customers. This new customer alliance structure is designed to create tighter alignment and integration between customer requirements and product innovation while increasing the ease of leveraging Akamai's services and is intended to help us better serve our customers and accelerate growth. Under this new division construct, revenue from our Media Division was $292 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year or flat on a constant currency basis. The Media Division is impacted by the continued DIY efforts of our two largest customers, Media customers that I mentioned earlier. Revenue growth for the Media Division customers outside of the top two was a healthy 11%. Revenue from the Web Division was $264 million, up 18% year-over-year. We have continued to see solid growth in this customer base with particularly strong security growth of 51% year-over-year in constant currency. Lastly, revenue from the emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division was $12 million in the quarter, up 45% year-over-year. To be helpful, as we migrate to this new division reporting lens, we will continue to report the former solution category view through the balance of 2016. And even though our security revenue will now be embedded within each of the three division's revenue results, we will continue to break out total security revenue separately. You will find all these revenue results detailed in today's press release and on our investor relations website. Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 30% of total revenue in Q1, up two points from Q4. International revenue was $170 million in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year or up 27% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a year-over-year basis and was roughly neutral on a sequential basis. We continue to see very strong growth in our Asia Pacific geography. Revenue from our U.S. market was $397 million, up 2% year-over-year. As we have shared with you previously, our two largest Media customers reside in the U.S. and continued to weigh heavily on domestic revenues. Outside of these two customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business. Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77% consistent with Q4 levels, down one point from the same period last year, and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 66%, down one point from the prior quarter, down two points from the same period last year, and in line with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $259 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition related charges and other non-recurring items. Of particular note in the quarter, we recorded $7 million in non-recurring restructuring charges for severance and impairments related to the organization realignment. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $201 million, down $9 million from Q4 levels and at the low end of our guidance. As always, we will strive to balance investments in the business to align with the expected near-term moderation in revenue growth rates. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $234 million, down $4 million from Q4 levels from the seasonal revenue declines Q4 to Q1, and up $11 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41% consistent with Q4 levels, down one point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $81 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $70 million consistent with Q4 levels and slightly below our guidance due to the timing of network deployments. Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $164 million, down $4 million from Q4 and up $1 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, consistent with Q4 levels and down two points from the same period last year, and one point higher than our guidance given the strong revenue attainment and cost efficiencies mentioned earlier. Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the first quarter was $3 million, consistent with Q4 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the first quarter was $75 million or $0.42 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $118 million or $0.66 of earnings per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. Our better than expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues and continued efficiencies in the business. For the quarter, total taxes were included in our GAAP earnings were $38 million based on an effective tax rate of 33.5%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million, based on an effective tax rate of 29.4% and in line with our guidance. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 178 million shares, down 2 million shares from Q4 levels from our opportunistic increase in share-buyback activity and in line with our guidance. Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 60 days, up one day from Q4 levels. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $85 million and at the low end of our guidance for the quarter. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities. Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Free cash flow was $108 million in the first quarter or 19% of revenue, a very strong result considering Q1 is our seasonally lowest free cash flow quarter. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $800 million. During the quarter, we spent $109 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 2.2 million shares. As we mentioned in our last earnings call, the board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program through the end of 2018. We have approximately $960 million remaining on that authorization. And as we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, this new authorization is intended to continue our multi-year capital allocation plan to offset dilution from equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions. In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q1 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company. Looking ahead, we are projecting revenue from our top two customers to decline in Q2 and possibly the second half of the year. As such, we are expecting slightly less sequential growth in the second quarter than we have historically seen. We expect Q2 revenues in the range of $566 million to $582 million. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive impact on Q2 revenue of roughly $3 million sequentially and less than $1 million compared to Q2 of last year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of roughly 76% and GAAP gross margins of 65%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $206 million to $211 million. As I have mentioned on the past couple of calls, we have purposefully slowed down the rate and pace of head count additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top-line growth expectations, but we are continuing to make prudent investments in the business that we believe are necessary to support sustained long-term growth and scale. Factoring in all these items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of 40%. And as I continue to message, we will strive to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. Of course, our ability to maintain EBITDA margins in this range will be heavily dependent on several factors, including revenue volumes, possible M&A, and spending on platform capacity in anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services. Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $73 million to $75 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 27% for Q2. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.62 to $0.65. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $46 million to $48 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 176 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $90 million to $98 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. As always, we will strive to balance network investment against future revenue opportunity and continued network efficiency initiatives. In closing, Q1 was a solid start to 2016, and we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to execute on our long-term plans. Thank you. And Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. You talk about the growth in the Media segment of about 11% ex the two largest contributors. Could you talk about the trend in that growth ex those two largest contributors and how we should think about the sustainability of that growth? Is that a reasonable way to think about that segment ex the two large players going forwards? Thank you. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good question, Mark. That \u2013 actually that growth rate is consistent with the growth rates that we saw in Q4. We have kind of been in the double-digit range for a while. Sometimes it will be a little bit higher than that. As we shared in the past that sometimes growth rates in the Media business are affected by large software releases, a gaming release, or things of that nature. But I think generally speaking, we expect that we can probably operate in the low-double digits for the Media Delivery outside of those top two customers. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Sanderson with MKM Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Rob J. Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC : Thank you. Couple of \u2013 one for Jim and one for Tom. Tom, a question on cost reduction, many years of high growth and traffic volumes along with price breaks that you have been passing along, but how much has the company been able to cost reduce traffic delivery over the years? Is there a way we could sort of compare cost per bit today to, say, five years ago? And I would think the past is something like Moore's Law, but is there any way you can attempt to quantify that? And how does \u2013 do you think this compares to some of the generic CDN or some of the do-it-yourself efforts that you have seen over this timeframe? And then a quick one for Jim. Free cash flow \u2013 will Q1 be the seasonal low again this year as in the past or is there something unusual seasonally this Q1 for cash generation? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. To the first question, we've put a lot of effort in R&D to reduce our internal cost per bit, to deliver more bits per second per CPU, more bits per second per square foot of colo, per kilowatt of power. And then we pass on those savings to our customers. So I think as you look over time, every year we're able to offer significant cost reductions on a per bit basis to our customers. So over five years, the savings are really quite substantial. We are very competitive when it comes to pricing for large-traffic customers, and I think we are very competitive with not only the other CDNs out there, but also the do-it-yourself effort that some of our largest customers have tried to engage in. And you see this where some of our large customers have had do-it-yourself efforts in the past, and then after a few years discover that, wow, Akamai is a lot more effective at it, and charges them less than their internal efforts cost them. And so then our traffic grows again, even though they've got do-it-yourself efforts. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, on the question on free cash flow, as you know, free cash flow really depends upon a couple things. One, we're not a inventory-centric company, so other than profitability, collections tends to be \u2013 receivable collections tends to be the kind of driver from quarter-to-quarter, if you see upticks or downticks. Also CapEx happens to have variability from quarter-to-quarter. But I would expect that \u2013 this will probably still remain our seasonally lowest quarter, but it all depends upon capital expenditures. And as I said earlier that if we see demand that we need to do more network deployment, we'll do that. So, I don't want to signal something and then later on if we may be a little bit lower than that \u2013 that it really depends upon CapEx investments. But I'd say based on our current line of sight, it probably will be the lowest seasonal quarter this year as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. Yeah, hi, Tom, Jim. Question is on your Security business. We get this question from clients a lot, saying would the law of large numbers start impacting the Security business, because it's primarily selling into DDoS, and web application security versus the broader security opportunity. I'd like to hear your thoughts there. Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'm not sure what you mean by the law of large numbers, but the attacks are certainly growing in size and sophistication to the point now where any of the traditional defenses simply don't work. You can't defend yourself by buying boxes and putting them in your data center. You can't even defend yourself by buying a clean pipe from a carrier simply because of the scale of the attacks. And that's why Akamai has been uniquely able to defend a lot of the world's major enterprises against the largest attacks out there. In addition, we're able to defend against the attacks that try to deface or corrupt a website, change the content in a way to embarrass the website owner, and also to \u2013 we can defend against the attacks where you try to steal data from the web application, like a credit card, or information about a transaction. Going forward with our Enterprise and Carrier Division, we are developing products that will protect enterprise employees, for example, from phishing, malware kinds of attacks, or enterprise data exfiltration attacks. So it's a \u2013 I think a very exciting future potential for us in security. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: A quick follow on, Tom. Is corporate video \u2013 you know, we all in big companies have these all-hands meetings, town-hall meetings where tremendous video volumes get generated in corporate networks, which is quite expensive. Would Akamai have a play there in kind of better managing or making corporate video and enterprises more efficient? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, absolutely, and in fact we have a product today through the Octoshape acquisition that supports corporate videos to off-load their private network, or their corporate network, and so it gives a very high-quality experience, very secure without flooding the branch office network. Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Two questions if I may. The first one, I just have a point of clarification on guidance. I just want \u2013 I thought I heard you say that you thought that the top two customers could further decline in the back half of the year. I think the previous expectation was that they would trough at around 6% or \u2013 6% or greater in the second quarter. And I just wanted to clarify what I thought you might have said during your comments on guidance. And then I have a follow-up question. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so on the guidance that \u2013 I'd say we're probably appropriately being cautious, to be frank that the \u2013 we have good visibilities within the quarter for these top two customers. I would say the visibility beyond the quarter is less, and so what we're trying to do is be cautious in what we're telling you that we certainly expect from Q1 to Q2, as we told you last time, that revenue volumes would decline for these top two customers. And I think what we're saying is that we're not 100% sure on the back half of the year, so we're being a little cautious in our projections that it could decline further. There are things that could stabilize it. There are things beyond that depending upon different features and capabilities for these two customers that could cause it to grow as well, but I'd say what we're trying to provide you is a level of cautiousness. And that's the way we're looking at it internally. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: I guess to some degree that implies that these customers are on some form of month-to-month or short-term contract that they have the ability to turn on and turn off service quarter-to-quarter. Is that a fair interpretation? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, it's not. These customers are on long-term contracts, but these contracts are structured in a way that volumes can ebb and flow from period to period. There are kind of minimums that they need to hit, but the volumes can certainly fluctuate to a point. But these customers are on long-term contracts. They are not on month-to-month contracts. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then just my follow-up question, I think you had been looking for a head of sales for your Web Division, and I wondered if there's been any update on that? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We are in the process of a search there. So, no update. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Maybe just following up on the Media side, taking the top two customers. Curious about the visibility, you've often talked about talking with the customers around timing of software updates and different items that might move the needle in terms of volume. How would you say your visibility in the rest of the customer base looks at this point of the year as compared to last year? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think honestly it's similar to our top two customers as well. Our visibility within the quarter is certainly a lot better than our visibility for the remainder of the year. There're certainly things that we know that are going to occur. Things like the Olympics, things like presidential debates and things of that nature that will cause volumes. And there are certainly staged rollouts of software releases and things of that nature, but I'd say we have very, very good visibility within a three-month window. It just lessens in the back half and that's not just for the top two customers. In general, that's just the nature of the Media business. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Great. I'm going to try to sneak in two questions too. First, I was just wondering if you'd give us a little bit more color on international. It's obviously been growing very well and it's becoming a much more meaningful piece of your business. You know, it's harder to have visibility into the competitive landscape drivers, et cetera, as we look into the some of the international markets, and I was hoping you might spend a second talking about that. And then I'm curious, because we've been doing a lot of work on Internet of Things. And the more I look at it, particularly around connected car, driverless car, things that require performance sensitive information to make their way into the network, the Internet of Things is looking more and more like a DDoS attack from my seat. And I'm just wondering about your perspective for the role of Akamai and world of Internet of Things? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Let me start, Tom (sic) [Jonathan] (36:46) with obviously your comment on international growth. Our international growth, you're right, has been very strong. We grew 27% in constant currency in Q4. It's growing particularly well in our Asia Pacific geography. So we've seen very, very strong growth across our Asia Pacific markets. And as you know that when we began investing in incrementing the sales force, we were investing more in our sales resources outside the U.S. than actually in the U.S. And as we told you in the past that it takes time for a rep to ramp to productivity. And so I think you're starting to see the benefit of the investments that we've made. And so we're very pleased with that. From a competitor landscape perspective that there's still kind of broad global competitors, that you know who they are and then there are local competitors in different markets. But I'd say that we have fared very well and I think there's a significant opportunity to continue to grow internationally faster than actually in the U.S. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And to the IoT question, the proliferation of devices and the Internet of Things represents really a great opportunity for Akamai. You know in particular, you mentioned connecting cars. We have great relationships with the world's major automotive companies. They are obviously very interested in having fast and reliable communication with their cars and the devices and they are very worried about security, as you can imagine. Not only denial of service, but application layer attacks where somebody might try to gain control of the car, corrupt information on the car, and that's a wonderful opportunity for our security services. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead. James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk about the capital intensity overall, and your team spent a lot of capital in 2015 in anticipation of some of the OTT build-outs. And how that's sort of flowing through the cost structure now and how that would impact spending in the future? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. So on CapEx, you're right that we were above our long-term model in last year, in 2015. We signaled that, that we were about 19% of revenue. It was all driven by incremental network CapEx. You certainly saw for the quarter, that I think $85 million was about 15% of revenue. So I think we're certainly going to be dialing CapEx down in alignment with what we're seeing here, but I expect we'll be back to our long-term model of 16% to 18%. Again, we signaled that if we see demand in the back half of the year that requires us to do more build-out, we'll do that but I expect we should be in the 16% to 18% range with network CapEx, which is the component that has the most variability, dialing back from roughly 10% of revenues last year to probably in the 8% range this year. James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hey, good afternoon. I know you typically suggest that no one major event has an impact on revenue, but isn't there likely to be some degree of favorable impact from the Olympics in Q3, just given the favorable time zone and just increased consumption of these types of events online? And then secondly, you talked a bit about competition earlier. There's been increasing chatter in recent weeks on competitive threats from Google and other players in the space. Can you just give us your take on what we're seeing there and if anything's changing in your view? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. I'll take the first one and then Tom can comment on the competitor landscape, but yeah, I think we definitely said historically that there isn't any one event that is a significant needle-mover on revenue in a quarter. We've never said that we don't garner revenues from those events. And certainly events that last over multiple days, generate more revenues than events that last for a day or a few hours. So you will definitely see revenue volumes as a result of the Olympics in our results, so you will see that. But again, it's not going to be a significant needle-mover over \u2013 I would say very, very large software updates tend to be more of a needle-mover than an event like that. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. In terms of competition, I don't see any real change in the landscape there. You're right. And you mentioned there's been chatter about Google and so forth, but that's I think what it is. The Google service is designed to provide delivery for applications that are on their compute and storage infrastructure. In that regard, they're completing with AWS and Azure, for example. And we really don't see real impact from that. As you know, we have dozens of competitors and always have. And we differentiate ourselves based on our level of performance. So if you want your applications to be faster, whether you're on Google, Azure or AWS, you would use Akamai to accelerate those applications. If you want your applications to be secure, wherever you have them hosted, you'd use Akamai Kona Site Defender and our Prolexic Routed capabilities and that will protect you from DDoS attacks and application layer attacks. And if you want your video and media delivered with very high quality, whether you're using any of those cloud services to store the content or not, again you'd use Akamai to do that delivery for you, to get the high-quality video experience. So no fundamental change in the competitive landscape at all. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into your enterprise security business, the Enterprise Division now, around $12 million revenue, almost double. And you talked about Bot Manager. So first question is what sort of feedback have you got on Bot Manager? That's pretty interesting product. But also, what's your plan to expand this business? Are you planning to acquire more of this kind of tuck-in acquisition or are you planning to build in-house products? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So first let me make it clear that Bot Manager is part of our web security business. And that's in the Web Division. That product is built by the Web Division. And the customer feedback there has been outstanding. The capability to identify the bot type and then tailor the response based on the bot type is really unique out there, and of high value to our customers. We have some customers that see half of their requests are actually from bots, and there's many different types of bots. Some are friendly, some are very much not friendly, and there's those that are in between. So I would say the initial customer reaction is very strong. That is a Web Division product. Now, for our enterprise security products, we don't have any in the marketplace yet. Our first product will be based on recursive DNS. That is the capability that we do have in the market through our carrier partners for home use, and we will be bringing to market for enterprise use later this year. And that's designed to protect an enterprise from malware, from phishing attacks, and from data exfiltration attacks. Now, in terms of our strategy, I think you'll see us do a lot of development organically and you'll also see us continue to make acquisitions. And as you know, recently we made acquisitions with Xerocole and Bloxx, and they are in the enterprise security space. And also we've done organic development, taking the Xerocole capability for carriers and now in the process of bringing a product to market for enterprise security. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for the color. Just a quick housekeeping question. How much was the DSD revenue that you moved from Media to Performance and Security this quarter? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I want to recall, it's like $109 million. We shared that at our IR summit. It's actually available on the investor relations... Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, but do you have anything for this Q1? How much was that? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. It's embedded in our overall results, so you can generally divide it by four. That's, roughly speaking, what the quarterly average is. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mark D. Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to look at the over-the-top opportunity. It's been a couple of months since your analyst day. We're a couple months further in the year. Can you give us an update on what you're seeing there? I would kind of imply from your guidance on your top two customers that maybe that's still kind of in limbo. But just wondered if you could give us an update on what you're seeing there. Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. The guidance from the top two customers really isn't related to OTT capabilities. I think, in general, there's a lot of interest in the over-the-top space. It was exciting to deliver the first major sporting event in the U.S. in 4K. And that business is growing nicely for us. I don't know of any particular fundamental change in the landscape that would cause a huge overnight increase in traffic, but I expect to have steady and substantial growth over time with over-the-top. Mark D. Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co.: So, the top two customers are unrelated to your expectations in OTT? Just to be clear on that. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Currently, yes. Mark D. Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. Thanks for taking the question. I'm sorry, I got to beat this dead horse one more time, but I'm getting questions over the transom here. So, the 6% for the two DIY customers at the end of Q2, was that a 6% exit rate, or an average for the first half? And then, therefore, are you talking about potential decline from an average 6% or an exit rate 6%? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, 6% is \u2013 we shared that in Q4 that what we had said was that these two customers combined used to be about 13% of our revenues, and they have been declining. And we said that we expected that they'd probably decline to about 6% of our revenues. Now obviously, a percentage implies that you know what your other businesses are going to do. So, to some extent, there is a little bit of variability in 6%, whether it's 6%, whether it's 5%, whether it's 7%. But we expect that the revenue volumes will decline in Q2. And based on this guidance that we provided at the midpoint, that is roughly 6% of their revenues in the quarter. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. In the second quarter? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's correct. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. And then the back half could be, conservatively, a little lighter than that? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's right. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. Very clear. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Jim, also, can you comment on how you said that you would be limiting investments at this point? It does seem like the OpEx guide is pretty light even with EBITDA margins where they are. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I mean, we continue to make the appropriate investments in the business that we think are necessary. But, Tom and I are managing the company prudently. And we think that we want to manage a company kind of in the low 40%s EBITDA range, which means that we're scaling back investments. We're not scaling back investments that would jeopardize future growth and scale for the company, but, yeah, we are scaling back the level of investments, relative to what we were doing in kind of prior years, and you can expect that we'll continue to do that. But, again, we're still making very targeted investments. We're making targeted investments in areas to help scale the network. We're making targeted investments in areas of R&D and things of that nature. So, we are still making investments in the business, but we're just making them at a slower pace. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And to be clear, we are growing head count and growing the business. It's just not at the rapid pace that you saw over the last few years. So, there's still plenty of growth at Akamai, in the investments. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I guess, the reason for asking is, it seems, especially with everything you did in NAB just having finished and the BOCC product having rolled out. It seems as if there's a lot that can be done in terms of end-to-end value creation for broadcast. Areas you've dabbled in, I guess, well within, had some participation in the past, whether it's in ingestion, transcoding, digital rights management, content management areas of the broadcast supply chain. And wondering whether or not that's important to invest there now, and if you're ramping that up at all. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Now, we are continuing to make investments. That is one area that's very important for us. And we believe there is a very large future in over-the-top video. And so it makes perfect sense to invest in those areas, and we continue to do so. For example, the BOCC is an area that we talked about. Also, obviously, investing in web security, obviously investing in enterprise and carrier products, particularly enterprise products for networking and security. And you will continue to see the investment and growth there. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks a lot, Tom. Thanks, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. I had a couple questions as well. I guess the first one is, I was wondering, you mentioned software downloads as a big driver. And I'm just wondering, I mean, we saw some of the very large software download last September get about three-quarters smaller than they were in the past. And there seems to be a big focus on people reducing file sizes, there's been a lot of improvements in encoding. I'm just wondering how you think about those initiatives, and how that might impact traffic volume that you might see going forward versus when the files were much larger in the past? And then I had a follow-up question. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think certainly for traffic, the software downloads come in varying sizes. You're right, that in some cases, they're smaller for the reasons that you outlined. In some cases, they happen more frequently. So they're smaller, but happen more frequently. And it's not just software updates that are drivers of traffic volumes, video delivery is a driver of traffic volume, social media is a driver of traffic volumes, gaming is a driver of traffic volumes. So, software download activity is kind of but one of several growth drivers on traffic. And you'll see variability in software traffic volumes, based on frequency and size. And, what was your second question? Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Well, I mean, I guess just to follow-up on that. Encoding was the other thing I mentioned. And Facebook's Head of Network Engineering actually spoke at F8, and mentioned that because of improvements in encoding, they're actually able to reduce the size of their video files now by 20%. So, I guess, that gets the other thing. There's file sizes and software downloads, but there also seems to be improvements in encoding that might be impacting some of the file sizes of video that used to get transferred versus what maybe they were two years ago. So that's one thing that I guess, I wonder if you have a comment on. And then the other would be, I mean, clearly, everyone has asked about these top two customers, and the trajectory in the back half of the year. I guess, what I'm interested in is, 12 months to 18 months ago, there was concerns over DIY and it was always kind of talked about that you just get a better experience, which you do using Akamai. So, unlikely that these guys would take such bold steps to bring as much in house. I guess, there're some concern that we get from people that what's to stop the third and fourth largest customers that you have now from embarking down the same path? Are they just so far away from having the level of traffic at the top two that it's just not a viable opportunity for them? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good. Let me take those two questions. The first one is, there's always improvements in video compression technology. And I think the important thing to look at is the increase in bit rate because you need a higher quality picture, combined with the decrease in bit rate because you've got better compression. And you mentioned, a 20% improvement in compression that pales in comparison to the increasing bit rates that we're seeing because people want a higher quality picture. In fact, if you take the combination of state-of-the-art quality picture combined with state-of-the-art compression, and the CAGR of that net, for years, it was growing but at a slower rate. And now we're seeing it actually accelerate on the accumulative growth rate. So, taking the state-of-the-art compression combined with typical bit rates that people are watching, actually it's growing per minute of video watched, and growing now at a faster rate than it has in the past. And on top of that, you have people watching longer, and more content moving online. And so the net effect is actually much faster growth rate in aggregate traffic being consumed for video online. You can take as an example, the Super Bowl stats that we gave. And we're seeing that kind of growth pretty much across the board in video. Now to your third question about DIY, and, well, can that go to the third and fourth largest customers. Well, in fact, our third and fourth largest customers have had DIY for over a decade. And in fact, one of them actually sells a CDN service, yet they still use us to deliver their content for their website, and they use us to deliver their videos. And they have a very large website, and a very large video business. And they use us to deliver that, despite the fact that they actually operate a CDN service in half the last decade. The other provider uses us as well, despite in-house efforts they've run over the years. And in fact, our share of their business has increased during this same period, because they see the quality difference and the cost difference. DIY can seem like a good idea at the time, maybe they can save some money bringing it in-house or they think that, but then after a few years they discover that, oh my goodness, Akamai is doing it with a lot less cost and with a lot better performance. And so, our share has actually increased in the third and fourth largest customers. And there's not too many past, the top four, that actually can even afford to think about doing their own delivery. So, yeah, we're experiencing some loss to DIY in our top two accounts now. I think the timeframe for when that happens is bounded, as Jim says, the impact it'll have on our business. And then you'll see our cumulative growth rates return to where the norm of the rest of the business is. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ed McGuire with CLSA. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. I'm intrigued by the role that your software on 100 million endpoints is playing in your ability to rein in costs across the network. Could you talk about what you are accomplishing with that footprint of software, and whether that is actually having the desired impact of helping you rein in costs of content delivery? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. When it is actively used, it substantially decreases our cost. And we passed a lot of that savings on to our customer that's making use of it. And the usage today depends on the customer. Also, it helps us a lot with quality. In fact, we used it in the broadcast at 4K, which is very high quality levels. It really helps to have the client side software to enable that. So, it makes quality better and decreases cost. And when we use it, it's a substantial decreasing cost. Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Will Power with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. Yeah. Just a follow up on some of the guidance commentary. Jim, I think you had alluded to limited second half visibility. And I guess, I just wanted to clarify, is that more limited this year, or is that fairly consistent with what you would normally see at this time of year as you kind of think about the second half? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, it's pretty consistent with what we've told you all along. Our visibility within the quarter was certainly much better than our visibility kind of out beyond that. As I mentioned earlier that we know of specific events, like the Olympics, like a presidential debate. And we know of scheduled activities that customers have for potential gaming releases and things of that nature. But the visibility within a three-month window is certainly much better than beyond that, but it's no different this year than it was historically. Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe quickly on the security business, obviously strong growth again. Any way to quantify how important the new Bot product was to that growth, and any other color on kind of the key drivers within that segment? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we haven't really seen revenue from it yet, because we just launched it. But there is substantial customer interest in that capability, and I do expect it to start contributing to our revenues and revenue growth and security going forward. But the 47% year-over-year growth, that's from the products that we've have had before, and Bot Manager and the other products on the roadmap will help sustain that kind of growth rate going forward and help us grow revenues for the security products in the future. Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. In terms of the enterprise business, you just put a senior executive in place as a General Manager there. Your revenue growth is there, but its revenue levels are still pretty small. What are kind of the key success metrics that you've put in place for this business? Obviously, you've been working on it for a couple of years. At least in my opinion, it should have been, probably could have been bigger than what we had thought a couple of years back. So, if you can elaborate on that. And the second question is, obviously, we're seeing the DIY happening at a couple of customers. What are the applications that are easy to kind of bring in-house? And in that context, can you talk about OTT, and does it have characteristics that make it very difficult to achieve in-house? Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. On the enterprise business, I think the success metrics would be around the products that we're in the process of bringing to market. So, for enterprise security that would be our recursive DNS service, which will be designed to block malware, phishing attacks and blocking exfiltration of sensitive data from the enterprise. And we'll be launching that product later this year. And so, you would look to see and we'll be looking to see the adoption rate of that capability. We'll also be bringing to market early next year our cloud connected branch product, which is enterprise networking combined with a secure web gateway functionality. And that's designed to make the enterprise network scale in a much better performing way, and in a much more cost-effective manner. And so, we would be looking to see the adoption rates there. I think the potential in both of those areas is very large, but you're right, we're at the very early stages. And we have to see how successful we are with those products in the market next year. In terms of DIY and the top two accounts, I think you would look at things that are easier to deliver. For example, software, maybe short form VOD, videos on demand, but short form. It's not OTT. And I think as you think about OTT, I don't see that as a DIY kind of thing today. It is much harder to do, particularly in the live and linear format, particularly in the higher quality that you'll want to have when subscribers are actually paying to view the content. That's a whole different game. And there's a lot you have to do. And today Akamai is in a great position to provide that quality. Just one example being the first broadcast of 4K, but, in general, sustaining very high bit rates, very low re-buffer rates at scale. And that's what you need for OTT delivery. And that's why a lot of the companies that are doing OTT are turning to Akamai to do it. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg Powell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. This is actually Priya Parasuraman in for Greg. Just a quick one. Could you talk about the kind of traction you're seeing in the mobile performance solution set? Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, very strong traction. And we were very pleased to see that we now crossed the 1,000-customer threshold for our Ion product, which, of course, delivers the best possible performance across all your web access, but is really focused on mobile acceleration. So, very strong traction there. And, of course, that's not surprising because as we talked about today, a lot of our customers have over half of their transactions going to mobile devices. It is a particularly challenging area for performance, particularly when a mobile device is using a cellular network, and ironically that's where users expect to get the best performance. And so, I think, that's why so many enterprises are turning to Akamai and buying Ion for their mobile assets. Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Okay. This is Tom. I think we have time for one more question, operator. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. Just made it. One real quick one for you. Sales capacity at the end of the year, how are you thinking about sales capacity additions for 2016? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think we've shared before that when we started investing in a very, very significant way in sales a couple years ago, we were providing kind of ongoing updates around how we were doing. And then, I think what we said is that, it's kind of run rate now in the business. And that it's not noteworthy to be talking about investments of a specific amount in any particular area. You can expect that we'll continue to kind of make investments across all areas of the business, including go-to-market capability. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Well, thank you, Jeff. And thank you everyone for actually a very good set of questions this quarter. In closing, we will be presenting at a number of investor conferences and events in May and June, and details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Thank you for joining us. And have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Akamai Technologies Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please begin. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And we appreciate you joining us for Akamai's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on July 26, 2016. And Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found in the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, please let me turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q2 was another solid quarter for Akamai, with continued strong growth for our Cloud Security Solutions and excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the second quarter was $572 million, up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 was $0.64 per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $165 million in the second quarter, bringing the total free cash flow for the first half of the year to $273 million, which is more than double the total for the first half of 2015. As we discussed on past calls, our overall revenue growth rate is unusually low this year, because of the do-it-yourself, or DIY, efforts of two of our largest customers. As these customers deliver more of their content themselves, it has meant less revenue for Akamai. In Q2, these two customers accounted for a little over 5% of our total revenue, down from 12% in Q2 of last year. I know that some of you have expressed concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business. And so I'd like to take a few minutes now to address the subject. While any company could, in theory, try to build their own CDN, doing so is a very expensive endeavor that I believe is simply not practical for the vast majority of our customers. In addition to the cost, it's also very difficult to build a CDN that has anywhere near the scalability, quality and security provided by Akamai. And so large-scale DIY is generally only attempted by the Internet's largest media and infrastructure companies. For the most part, we've been successful in competing with DIY efforts by offering much better performance, scale, and security at a favorable price point. There are numerous companies, including some of the world's largest, who have gone through the effort to build their own CDN and then subsequently turned to Akamai because of our superior quality and cost. Several years ago, many of the world's leading carriers had DIY CDNs, whereas today, most of them rely on Akamai for the majority of their CDN needs. Examples include AT&T, Bell Canada, China Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, Korea Telecom, Orange, Rogers, Singtel, Telecom Italia, Telef\u00f3nica, Telstra, T-Systems and T\u00fcrk Telekom. Overall, I believe that our risk of future revenue loss from DIY is confined to a few of the Internet's largest infrastructure and platform companies. For example, companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix. Most of these companies spend large sums of money on infrastructure and some consider CDN to be a core part of their platform. All are well known to have DIY capabilities and all are Akamai customers. In aggregate, these six companies accounted for less than 11% of our total revenue in Q2, down from 18% in Q2 of last year. As you know, most of this reduction was from the two customers that we have talked about on past calls. To be clear, I'm not talking about these six companies now, because I think they're going to go away. Quite the contrary. We believe there are substantial opportunities for revenue growth in these companies over the longer term. And to the extent that there are further declines in revenues from these companies in the near term, we expect them to be more moderate than what we have experienced in the past year. While the near term concern about DIY and our largest few customers is understandable, I think it's important for you to know that the core of our business is large and growing at a very healthy rate. For example, if you exclude the contribution of these six companies, Akamai revenue in Q2 was well over $0.5 billion and growing at a rate of 15% year-over-year. As a result of this core strength and the limited future exposure in our largest accounts, we anticipate that our overall revenue growth rate will begin to reaccelerate as we enter 2017. Of course, whenever there is a lull in revenue growth, it can put pressure on margins. And while we're always careful with how we spend our OpEx, I want to assure that we will continue to invest in innovation and the development of new products to address the needs of our customers. As we look to the future, we see multiple opportunities for significant growth as more high-quality video moves online, billions more mobile devices enter the market, the number, scale and sophistication of cyber-attacks continues to rise, and as enterprise applications continue to move into the cloud. We believe that each of these trends provides significant tailwinds for Akamai. For example, in the Media Division, our OTT business has continued to grow at a rapid rate, following the record breaking results of the Super Bowl and March Madness in Q1, Akamai delivered a very successful Euro 2016. In addition to providing very high video quality in countries throughout Europe and North America, we set a new record for Internet traffic for a single sporting event, during the final round match between Portugal and France, demonstrating once again Akamai's ability to deliver live, broadcast-quality content reliably and securely at scale. Next week, we'll begin delivering the Rio Olympics over the Internet for 50 customers and partners around the world. Our award-winning broadcast operation control center will be used to ensure the utmost in quality for broadcasters, many of whom will be leveraging our accelerated ingest and client technologies as well as our 4K and virtual reality solutions. Our Web Division also performed well in Q2. We were especially pleased with the continued strong growth of our Cloud Security business. The revenue from our Cloud Security products grew 42% year-over-year and exited Q2 with an annualized run rate of over $360 million. This is a significant accomplishment, given that we started this business only four years ago. And it serves as an example of what we hope to achieve with other new product lines as we continue to invest in innovation to make the Internet fast, reliable, and secure for our customers. Along these lines, our new Bot Manager solution is off to an excellent start, with many customers already under contract and hundreds more in the pipeline. Bot Manager allows our customers to distinguish bots from real users and also to tailor their response based on the type of bot that is accessing their website. This is especially important in the context of reservation systems and identity theft. The highly differentiated value proposition for this new product has been driving higher price points, which will potentially translate into significant revenue as we grow its market presence over the next few years. Later this year, we expect to release into beta our first enterprise threat protection product, which is designed to block access to malicious sites that support phishing, propagate malware, or aid in the exfiltration of confidential data. This new enterprise service will be powered by our AnswerX technology, which is already used in over 50 million homes worldwide to protect clients from undesirable Web content. We're excited about the potential for our new line of enterprise products, which we believe has an even larger long-term market than our existing market for protecting websites and applications. In the area of Web Performance, we're looking forward to the beta release of Ion 3 in September. Ion 3 is focused on improving performance for mobile devices and especially for mobile apps. A variety of new technologies are used to improve performance, including innovative algorithms to predict what content a user is likely to request and then pre-staging much of that content on the user's device. So that when the request is made, the response appears instantly. We're also excited about the upcoming launch of Image Manager next month. Image Manager automatically optimizes the version of an image that is sent to each user based on the user's device, browser type, and network conditions. As a result, page download times are much faster, especially in congested cellular networks. Early customer feedback on Image Manager has been very positive with one early adopter reporting a 10% increase in conversion rates as a result of the performance improvement. In summary, I believe that Akamai's business and market position remains strong and I'm excited about the significant opportunities for growth that lie ahead. So much so that I will be extending my personal stock buyback program, which I announced in Q1, to continue at a rate of $1 million per month for the rest of the year. I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q2 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q3. Jim? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the details of our Q2 financial results, given recent investor focus on the impact of DIY among two of our largest customers and concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business, we will now expand our disclosures to include the combined revenue contribution of the six large Internet platform customers that Tom mentioned a few minutes ago. This additional revenue information is intended to help you ring-fence the potential future exposure of DIY from this class of customers and to better assess the health of our business overall. There's also the potential that these large Internet platform customers continue to grow with us. The revenue contribution of these customers as a group can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. And now, on to the second quarter financial results. Q2 revenue came in at $572 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 15% if you exclude the six large Internet platform customers that Tom mentioned. Revenue came in slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to less-than-expected media traffic from one of these customers. Turning to our solution categories, revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $327 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year. Within the solution category, we saw solid growth across the major product lines, and as Tom mentioned, we continue to see significant growth and demand for our Cloud Security offerings. Second quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $87 million, up 42% year-over-year. Exiting Q2, our Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of over $360 million. We are pleased with how well our unique and differentiated Cloud Security capabilities are being adopted by our customers. And our recently launched BOT Manager offering is the latest example of how we are innovating to expand our security portfolio to meet strong customer demand. Turning to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $197 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and slightly less than our expectations, reflecting lower traffic and revenue volume from one of the six large Internet platform customers. Media Delivery revenue outside of the six large Internet platform customers continued to be solid, up 11% year-over-year with particularly strong growth among our over-the-top, or OTT, customers. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $48 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. We continue to see strong service attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise class professional services, particularly for customers buying our Web Performance and Cloud Security products. Turning now to our customer division results, and as we shared in our last call, we are now managing the company in a customer division structure that integrates the development, product management, marketing and sales teams into three divisions for focus on the company's Media, Web, and Enterprise and Carrier products and customers. Under this division construct, revenue from our Media Division customers was $288 million in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year, but up a healthy 14%, excluding the impact of the six large Internet platform customers. Revenue from our Web Division customers was $271 million, up 15% year-over-year. We continue to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our Cloud Security offerings. Lastly, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $12 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q2, up 1 point from Q1. International revenue was $177 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year, or up 24% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $1 million on a year-over-year basis and $4 million on a sequential basis. We continue to see very strong growth in our Asia Pacific geography. Second quarter revenue from our U.S. market was $395 million, down 1% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers are based in the United States and weighed heavily on the U.S. market's results. Outside of these customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business. Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 76%, down 1 point from Q1 levels and from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%, down 2 points from the prior quarter and down 3 points from the same period last year. GAAP operating expenses were $256 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $202 million, up slightly from Q1 levels and $4 million below the low end of our guidance as we continue to responsively balance investments in the business with the moderations in revenue growth rates. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $231 million, down $3 million from Q1 levels and up $17 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down 1 point from Q1 levels, consistent with the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $85 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million, up $4 million from Q1 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $157 million, down $7 million from Q1 and up $6 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, down 1.5 points from Q1 levels, down 1 point from the same period last year, and in line with our guidance. Moving on to other income and expense items, interest income for the second quarter was roughly $3 million, consistent with Q1 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the second quarter was $74 million or $0.42 of earnings per diluted share, up 14% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $112 million or $0.64 of earnings per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year and near the high-end of our guidance range. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $36 million based on an effective tax rate of 33%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 30% and just slightly above our guidance. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 176 million shares, down 1 million shares due to our opportunistic increase in share buyback activity and in line with our guidance. Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Day sales outstanding for the second quarter was 58 days, down two days from Q1 levels. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $87 million or 15% of revenue, below the low-end of our guidance for the quarter. 15% is also slightly below our long-term model as we continue to monitor traffic levels and invest in network expansion accordingly. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities. Cash flow generation continued to be very strong in Q2. Free cash flow was $165 million in the second quarter or 29% of revenue and $273 million year-to-date or 24% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very healthy, with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $910 million. During the quarter we spent $91 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.7 million shares. As of Q2 end, we had approximately $870 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And as we've discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, our share repurchase authorization is intended to continue our multi-year capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders, depending upon business and market conditions. Looking ahead to Q3, we are anticipating media traffic and revenue volumes from one of our large Internet platform customers to decline further in the third quarter. And while we see a traffic and revenue volume uptick in Q3 for the Olympics, we expect traffic patterns outside of this event to be consistent with what we have seen historically during the mid-summer months. Specifically, lower traffic volumes as people spend less time on the Internet. Given these dynamics, we anticipate a further sequential decline in our Media business in Q3, but we remain bullish on the longer-term secular trends for this business going forward. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on revenue of roughly $1 million sequentially and a positive impact of $2 million compared to Q3 of last year. Factoring in all of these items I just outlined, we are expecting Q3 revenue in the range of $566 million to $578 million. At the midpoint of this range, year-over-year revenue growth would moderate to 4%. And while we're not providing specific guidance beyond Q3, we do believe revenue growth will reaccelerate entering 2017. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 76% and GAAP gross margins of 64%, consistent with Q2 levels. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $206 million to $212 million. As I have mentioned on the past couple of calls, we have purposefully slowed down the rate and pace of head count addition and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations. However, even with the revenue deceleration we're experiencing, we believe it is important to continue to invest for the future. Most notably in incremental R&D product innovation aimed at fueling long-term growth and scale. Accordingly, we anticipate our lower revenue volumes in the near term will likely put some pressure on our EBITDA margin profile. We anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins in the range of 39% to 40%. As I have said in the past, one of the factors that could impact our EBITDA margin profile would be revenue volumes, particularly in the Media business. And while I am not providing specific guidance beyond Q3, EBITDA margins may dip into the high 30%s for the near term. Moving on to depreciation, we expect Q3 non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $76 million to $78 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 26% to 27% for Q3. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.62. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $44 million to $47 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 30%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $85 million to $93 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. And we anticipate remaining slightly under our long-term model of 16% to 18% of revenue for the year. In closing, despite some near-term challenges, we remain confident in our ability to reaccelerate growth rates for the business, execute on our long-term strategy, and continue to deliver a compelling financial model for our shareholders. Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. The first question is from Michael Bowen of Pacific Crest. Your line is open. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. Thank you very much. One point of clarification, I just wanted to make sure, we're going through it pretty fast there. But with regard to what you said about Media was up 11% in the current quarter, excluding, and I want to say, did you say the big two or the big six? And I've got a follow-up. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. No, what I said was that Media's up 11% excluding the big six Internet platform companies. Just to clarify on that, we're trying to provide this as a grouping to be helpful to the investors. We know that there's been concern about the impact of DIY, and so what we've tried to do is ring-fence this customer grouping that people are focused on. And based on some of the reasons that Tom outlined, and if you exclude this grouping that is really the focus of investor concerns around DIY, one, Akamai's business was a $500 million business in the quarter, growing 15% excluding these guys. So it's a very, very large and growing business. It just so happens that as we're going through a \u2013 for a couple of these six customers, as they serve more of the traffic themselves, we're seeing a moderation in Media growth rates. But, as we said, we expect that going into 2017, that we will see a reacceleration. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : And then maybe if I could just dig a little deeper, if I may. So with regard to the big six, first of all, are all of the big six just in the Media segment? Or do they bleed over into the other segments? And then, given that you had \u2013 I want to say it was 10% and 11% ex the big two for the Media segment, is there any way you can extrapolate for us? Or would you divulge what that is excluding the big two as far as the growth rate? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, yeah, I think what we'd rather do is group the customers as one grouping. So that you can see the growth rates excluding all these large six Internet platform customers. And your first question was whether or not these customers are only purchasing Media products. They're predominantly customers that buy Media products. A couple of them also buy our other solutions, but they're predominantly Media customers. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. Then last question I'll just squeeze in, and thanks for that color. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Mike... Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : With regard to \u2013 yes? Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Why don't we put you back in the queue there. That's four. So... Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. Got it. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : All right. Thanks. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Gray Powell of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. So, obviously, gross margins have been under pressure this year. I'm sensing that's merely a function of the lower traffic volumes and the relatively fixed data center and infrastructure components of your cost of goods sold. So as traffic growth starts to improve at some point, should we expect that to offset your excess capacity and gross margins to improve sometime over the next six months to 12 months? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I'm not going to provide guidance beyond the quarter, but I think you're thinking about it the right way that there is a fair amount fixed cost infrastructure that you build out. And obviously, we are still doing some build-out to support things like the Euro event that Tom mentioned, build out to support the Olympics and things of that nature. But I think it's probably worth noting that that's one of the reasons why you're seeing our CapEx levels lower. Our CapEx levels are probably going to be below our long-term model. Last year our CapEx levels were above our long-term model, because we were doing some build-out for what we thought was going to be an OTT offering. So kind of look at them together that you're going to have some years where you may be a little bit above. If you believe that you're going to be building out your network to support expected traffic growth. We happen to be in a period here where we're growing into the traffic we have and selectively deploying in areas that we don't have capacity. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. And then, just one follow-up. In the past when there's been excess capacity, how long has it taken for traffic growth to fill in and for everything to stabilize? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It depends. You know that not all traffic is the same. It depends upon the region. There are certain regions where traffic is growing very, very fast and we need to continue to do more build-out. There are other regions where you potentially have excess capacity and you have to grow into it. So it varies, and it depends upon different events that are going to occur. Again, you can have excess capacity, but you grow into it with an event like the Olympics. So it varies by geography. But we tend to do build-outs, probably, call it, three months to four months in advance. So that's generally one way to think about it, that we'll obviously modulate the network CapEx investments based on what traffic projections we see over the next, call it, three months to six months. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Michael Hart - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. This is Michael Hart on the line for Jonathan. We were wondering if you could perhaps provide a little more color about some of the opportunities you're seeing with partnerships such as the announcement \u2013 your partnership with Microsoft and how Akamai is being integrated into Azure offerings. And then, also, I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on what impact to your Performance and Security revenue the new product offerings you discussed might have later this year, and then, perhaps looking into next year. Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me take the first part of that. We're very happy with the new relationship with Azure and Microsoft. Now you can purchase Akamai whole site delivery for your Azure applications by checking the box. And also, Microsoft's field force is reselling Akamai capabilities across the board. So very pleased to see that happen. And, Jim, you want to take the revenue question? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Obviously, for new offerings like this, for the most part these offerings are subscription offerings. So once you have them, you have to sell them into your installed base, and then it takes a while to convert them into revenue. So they're not going to be a meaningful contributor to revenue in 2016. They certainly will contribute to revenue in 2017, but given the annuity nature of the business and the time to revenue for some of these things, it takes a while. But I think Tom's bigger point for these is, it wasn't that many years ago that we didn't have a security business. We launched a security business and we introduced a product Kona Site Defender. We then acquired Prolexic and we've expanded since then. That business, call it, four-and-a-half years later is now a $360 million business. I think what Tom's referring to is these are new offerings that we're going to add. And in the case of BOT Manager, it's an offering that has similar ARPUs as some of our other security products. And so we believe it's going to be a very strong contributor to security growth in the near term. And the same is true for the offering that Tom mentioned in the Web Performance family, that these are adjacent \u2013 Ion 3 obviously is an improvement to our existing product, but Image Manager is obviously an extension to the offerings that we already have. So these offerings, I think, are going to help fuel growth in security and help reaccelerate growth in our Web Performance products. Michael Hart - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Just some clarification. You said, Jim, I think you said that you'd see reacceleration of growth in 1Q of 2017. Currently, the Street actually had you reaccelerating, obviously, now in 3Q and then further into 4Q. So the simple math, then, is that we're going to see 4% \u2013 no more than 4% again in fourth quarter? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We're not specifically providing guidance. But you are right that based on those comments that \u2013 and the reason we didn't call for growth acceleration in the fourth quarter is we've been very clear with you guys in the past that the fourth quarter is heavily dependent upon holiday seasonality. And we didn't want to call acceleration in Q4 knowing that it's uncertain what holiday seasonality is going to be. I think our confidence that we will see reacceleration in Q1 is very high. But I'd say, Q4, it depends upon the holiday season. And if we have a very, very strong holiday season, both on the Media side and on the Web side, yeah, you may see reacceleration in Q4. But I'd say our confidence is very high for entering 2017, and that there's a possibility in the fourth quarter depending upon how the holiday shakes out. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And then, if I can get a follow-up, Jim. The customer that you said would be reducing its traffic, and I assume you meant dollars, too, in 3Q, is that one in the same \u2013 one of the top two that we were talking about? Because that's what I wondered. If it's not... James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Yes it is. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So it is one of the top two. So that it still continues. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's right. So as we mentioned in the last call that we had signaled that our visibility to traffic and revenue volumes for these, in particular, the top two customers is certainly greater in three months than it is in six months to nine months. And this particular customer's traffic and revenue was a little bit softer in Q2 than what we expected. And we are now projecting that that's going to be the case in the third quarter as well. It is probably important to note we've been in \u2013 we're trying to provide additional information for the sake of helpfulness that \u2013 of the top two customers, one of the top two is pretty much in line with where we thought. It's just one of them that's a little bit lower \u2013 the traffic volume. That customer tends to introduce a bunch of features on their platform. And it's difficult to predict the adoption rate that they have of their end users. And so traffic came in a little bit lighter than we expected. And we're calling that now for Q3. And while we're not providing guidance beyond Q3 that I'd say that particular customer is a customer that we're going to stay pretty close to as far as where do we think traffic volumes are going to go longer term. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Am I done or do I get another question? Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Michael, we'll put you in the back end of the queue here. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : We've got a long list. Thank you, though. Yep. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to revisit your comments on the potential for acceleration in 2017. Is that just a function that the comps are going to be easier? Because some of the catalysts that you have this year in terms of supporting traffic in 2016, you guys mentioned the Euro Cup, we have the Olympics. That doesn't happen next year. So I wanted to parse out the case for acceleration in 2017, given that some of these events are falling off in 2016. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think you've got part of it. Obviously, we believe that what we're seeing with these large Internet platform customers, the top six that we talked about, and notably, we're really talking about two of the six that we've seen more substantial revenue declines. As Tom mentioned, we see more traffic in revenue pulled off of our platform in the last few quarters. Our expectation going forward is that if we do see declines, the declines will be much more modest than what they've been. So, yes, there will be a component of it that is an easier comp with these large customers. I think it's also fair to say that while we have marquee events like the Euro Cup, like the Olympics, like a presidential debate, and they do contribute to some level of revenue. As we said in the past, these events by themselves are not huge needle movers on revenue. They just happen to be proof points around what's \u2013 the opportunity is for more and more consumption of content online. And that's really more what they represent than anything else. So, yes, you're not going to have as big an event period, but you're going to have other traffic activity just in general. There's going to be more video delivery consumed. There will continue to be more consumption of social media, there will continue to be more gaming releases, there will continue to be more software downloads. And all of those will be contributors to our ability to get revenue reaccelerating. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: In relation to that, you guys mentioned that OTT is starting to ramp for you guys. Is there any way to frame how much of a contributor the OTT business is having on your underlying growth rate? Maybe that growth rate of \u2013 that 15% ex the top two. How much of a contributor is OTT today to that underlying growth rate? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. It's a difficult thing to size that \u2013 I'd say what we tried to do is \u2013 because we have many customers that tend to do multifunction activities that they serve videos as well as doing other things \u2013 like they actually serve software downloads. But based on the customer grouping that call it our pure play, pure play video delivery over the top customers that \u2013 it's not a huge contributor to revenue in the near term. It just isn't. What we're seeing is steady growth in that customer base in the traffic. Steady growth in revenue. But you have not seen a step function move to viewing content via those platforms. They are growing steadily. They're growing nicely, but there has not been a catalyst yet to see a huge movement of people cutting the cord and moving online. So I think they'll be a steady grower. But today, the larger contributors to revenue in the Media business are still software download customers, gaming, and social media. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from James Breen of William Blair. Your line is open. Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question. In terms of visibility on the large customers that obviously \u2013 it's weighing on the stock the most. How far out can you see with those 10 (sic) [6] (41:12) customers in terms of the predictability of the revenue into the forward quarter? Obviously, the guidance for this quarter \u2013 for the third quarter is lower than what the Street was. How lumpy is that potentially going forward? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. It's six customers, not 10. Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Sorry. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And I would say, like I've said all along, that our visibility is certainly much better in the three-month window. We do have good relationships with all of these customers. And so you have some visibility about what's going to happen thereafter. But it's certainly less. We certainly know that these customers intend to remain loyal Akamai customers. The question is how much of the traffic do they continue to serve themselves and how much of the traffic do we serve? It also depends upon, for some of these customers, new capabilities that they introduce. There may be newer capabilities that they introduce that their CDN cannot support. So it's very possible that you see a reacceleration in this customer base. Not all these customers are trending downward. It's notable with two of them, but even one of these two, but depending upon launching new offerings, could be a reacceleration in growth for that customer as well. So it's tough to call. It depends upon decisions that they make in their company around things that they're going to introduce and the capabilities that they have and don't have. So I know it's not the answer that you want. But I think it's \u2013 that's just a fact that our visibility is pretty good near term. Good relationships with these customers for the long term, but the ability to call a specific number in 2017 and beyond is just \u2013 is difficult. Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Is some of this visibility consumer-driven based on consumer usage patterns, so even the companies your customers don't really understand it until the end of the quarter for them? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's funny you say that. Many times these big customers come to us and our ability to project what's happening with traffic is better than theirs, because you're really anticipating what happens to their end users. And sometimes we have better intelligence on that based on historical levels than they do. But there's a bunch of variables that contribute to that, plus it's also capabilities that they introduce and what their CDN can and can't do. Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: (43:45) previously you talked about the two largest customers being in the 6% of revenue range. Might that be something closer to 4% now while those six customers all be sort of less than 2% of revenue? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So those customers, as Tom mentioned, were a little over 5%, maybe like 5.5% in Q2. As I said in the last call, it's hard to predict a percentage because a percentage is based on what the company does in aggregate. So I do expect that those two customers are certainly, given that one of them we think is going to actually move and serve more of the traffic themselves, I do think they will be less than 5%. A specific number is tough to call, as I said because I don't know what the rest of the business is going to do, but, call it, roughly in that range is probably where they'll be. Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): All right. Thanks. Sorry, I'll keep beating this horse here. I doubt you want to get too granular. But before it sounded like the primary reduction in revenue from the big six companies was really just from those two largest customers, so are you seeing that decline extend further into the other four of the big six? Are they all declining? Or are some of them actually still growing? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, some of them are growing. As I said before, just to clarify, we grouped these customers for the reasons that Tom outlined. We know there's concern about DIY. We know these customers are well-known to have DIY. And we wanted to make sure that we were helpful to the investor community around ring-fencing, what was concern about what these large customers could do. That's why, we've done that. It doesn't mean that they're all trending in the wrong direction by any means. And while they all have DIY capability, several of them are increasing their use of Akamai over time. But, as you know, with large customers, large customers go through reprices. Large customers \u2013 there's a lot of things that affect large customers. But I would say that notably two of the six are serving more of the traffic themselves. One of the six in particular. The other ones have been, over the past, very healthy and growing Akamai customers. And so I think that you're going to have in that grouping a mix bag of customers that are growing and customers that may not be growing. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Okay. And then you mentioned that EBITDA margins may be somewhat capped and more in the high 30%s for some period of time. Would that be alleviated if we see revenue growth reaccelerate in the first half of 2017? Or is there a reason why that lower EBITDA margin target would extend beyond the end of this year? James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. It all depends on revenue volumes. And it all depends upon how much the volumes uptick. The reason I signal that in the near term we may need to operate in the high 30%s is that we're making the right investments in the business. And what we're not going to do is we're not going to constrain investment. We're going to be responsible, of course, to try to manage investments in line with the revenue moderation but we're going to make the investments we believe are right for the long term trajectory of the business. And if it so happens, the revenue volumes are a little bit lower then we could be in the high 30%s for the near term. But, again, as I said in the past operating at the model that we've outlined, which is the low 40%s, is dependent upon revenue volumes, is dependent upon possible M&A, and is dependent upon network build-outs that we do in particular. So those things are still all the same. We happen to be going through revenue volume that is a little bit less than we had expected. And we're not going to stop making the investments that we think are necessary. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. So I'm going to ask questions similar to what have already been asked, but slightly different. You mentioned that these top six customers represented about 18% of revenues a year ago, now about 11% and the top two, I think, were about 12% a year ago, and now 5%, so both of those the delta's about 7%. So it seems like the remaining four of the big six, if you will, have been growing roughly in line with that of the company, which this quarter was about 6%. So for those other big four, that 6% growth, is that a deceleration over the last few quarters? Or is 6% growth relatively what they've been growing at? And, I guess, where I'm going here is, if it is a deceleration, which would be my guess, the concern is obviously that's going to go further down. And it goes back to all these questions around visibility. I appreciate that for 2017 you think growth's going to accelerate, but it sounds like it's based more on easy comps and the fact that these two top customers are getting to a point where they can't go that much lower, at least that one in particular. What can you give us in terms of confidence or conviction that these other big four just aren't going to continue to see their own growth slowing? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we have very good relationships with those customers. Generally, we have pretty good visibility. Obviously one of the six did decelerate a little bit more than we expected this quarter. We're now forecasting that for Q3 as well. We do very valuable services for these large customers. Some of them have had their own do-it-yourself solution for a decade. And we have grown share against it. So I think we did not \u2013 as I said before, we did not introduce these six in any way to concern you that we think there's a problem there. We did it because we know you're concerned about those kinds of companies. And we wanted to reassure you that the impact they have on our business is small. And in fact, for many of them, there is substantial upside to the business. And I think that the key thing to focus on is that we have outside of that group, there's potential in that group for growth. But outside of that group, we have a $0.5 billion business growing at 15% a year with a very rich product road map that I think will propel growth into the future. So, again, to reiterate, the fact that we're talking about six is not because we think there's major problems in those six. It's simply to talk about that class of customers. And so you can understand exactly where we're getting our revenues and how we're doing. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, I guess, my follow-up question then, is regarding some of those big six \u2013 or top six, some of them actually offer their own CDN businesses, particularly the Amazons, the Googles, and the Microsofts, and I appreciate the partnership with Microsoft, in particular. But is there also something (51:11) here that those guys are also not just limiting their business with Akamai, but also potentially becoming increasingly more competitive as well? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I don't think so. We have competed with those companies' CDNs for a long, long time. In at least one case for probably close to a decade. We compete very successfully even with their in-house business. And that's because we provide a higher level of quality, greater scale, greater reliability, and, of course, security. So this is not a new phenomenon. We've been competing very successfully against these companies' offers for a long time. And I expect that we will continue to compete successfully against them in the future. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jim Shaughnessy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking our question. This is Jim Shaughnessy on for Mark. Again, just on the top six, is there any way you could give us some context around the size of these top six customers roughly? And maybe the next tier of customers? How much bigger are these customers to you in terms of size versus, say, that next tier? And I have one follow-up. Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, as you know, the two that we've been talking about are now a little over 5% of our revenue. And two of the other four are pretty small Akamai customers, but are big Internet entities. And so we did want to talk about that. I think there's upside in those accounts. And then, there's two more that are substantial Akamai customers. Well over 1% of our revenue. So you have four that are pretty large and you have two that are pretty small in terms of their impact on Akamai. Jim Shaughnessy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then a quick follow-up. In terms of upcoming renewals with any of these top six, have any recently taken place? And are there any upcoming, say, in the next few quarters that we should keep an eye out for? Thanks, guys. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. You want to think about these customers as coming up for renewal every one to two years is very typical. So we have experienced \u2013 some of them have had renewals recently. And we would expect renewals coming up over the next quarter or two. So that's an ongoing process with really all of our customers and these folks as well. Jim Shaughnessy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ed Maguire of CLSA. Your line is open. Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could provide a bit more context into the specific types of media traffic where you're seeing the insourcing activity and whether that's coming across all of the top six. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The insourcing of traffic is mostly around files where quality matters less and then it's easier to do. The extreme example being a background software download. At the other end of the spectrum, you might have live or linear broadcast where somebody's paying to watch it. And so as you get to the easier end of the spectrum, that's where I would say most of the traffic has moved in-house, software downloads and so forth or some videos where the quality might matter less. On the other side of the house, and as we talked about, our OTT business is growing very well, much faster than the Media business as a whole. And that's because you have \u2013 it's more difficult to do with a high-quality level, especially live and linear. And people are often paying to watch it. And so you really want to have a good experience there. Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. And could you comment on just the state of the sales force pipeline productivity rates and in particular, your degree of confidence around the pipeline and growth expectations for the second half of 2016 as it pertains to security and also performance as well? Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. Customers in the pipeline wouldn't be signed until later in the year. Then, of course, there's the integration and recognition of revenue. So you wouldn't start seeing a revenue stream from anything in the pipeline until next year. That said, the sales force has been productive. Bookings have been very strong. And so we're optimistic about the future growth there. Particularly in Cloud Security, a lot of the customers are now buying products first based on security and then adding performance. It's great to see that adoption of our security offer in the business. Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. Just following up on a previous question. It does seem like the big six now are building out a lot more of their own cloud capabilities, and some seem to be bundling in a little bit more CDN. So, Tom, it just seems to be different competition from what we've had in the past. I know Google, their CDN is in beta. Akamai's had their CDN out there for a while. I guess, you're obviously not concerned about competition from them, and a lot of investors are. Can you maybe tell us a little bit more detail why you're not concerned? Then are they really just competing on the Media side? Or do they also have Performance and Security applications out there or capabilities? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'm concerned about all our competitors. That said, we see much more competition from dozens of other companies than generally we would have from the large cloud providers. Our performance is a lot better. We don't really see the competition at all from them with the security product capabilities. It's primarily around delivery. We've been competing against at least one very large cloud company for nearly a decade that is known to bundle in CDN services. We have a lot of our customers use that company for hosting their website, either it's stored there or with compute, and they use Akamai to accelerate \u2013 to provide the delivery of the video or accelerate the delivery of applications or to secure the content. So I don't see any change in terms of the competition from these large Internet infrastructure companies against Akamai. So no change there. Now, for their own content, as we've talked about at great length, there's a couple of them that are delivering more of their own content. And that, of course, has had the impact on our overall revenue growth rates this year. But in terms of competing with other third parties, no. No change there in terms of the impact they're having on our business. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): But it does seem like, too, there's been a lot of new startups out there. And are they using some of the cloud infrastructure getting built? Or there just does seem to be a lot more news articles out there. Are you seeing any more competition from these startups? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: There are a lot of startups out there. I think that's always been the case, too. They don't use the cloud providers. What we do see is the attackers, they use the cloud infrastructure. And they can mask where they're coming from to make it harder to defeat them by coming from the big cloud companies. But we see the main competition is from the folks that have been doing it for a decade. And the one big change we've seen in the competitive marketplace has really worked in our favor and that is the major carriers. As I mentioned, several years ago, most of those major carriers competed actively against Akamai. And now the vast majority of those carriers partner with Akamai and make use of our technology. And that's been the one fundamental shift in the competitive landscape. And when I say competitive, I mean now an entity that's competing with us for third party content. So the major shift in the competitive landscape has been favorable. We've always had a lot of startups. For a long time we've had companies that have competed against us and they would be the majority of the competition. The cloud companies have been out there for, most of them for a long, long time, and no shift there. The only shift that's impacting our revenue is the DIY and a couple of large accounts, but that's not competing for third party content, and I don't expect it to. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Your line is open. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. I guess, first off, starting with the OTT opportunity, could you just highlight some of the key factors that you think will drive a more democratized marketplace? I guess, outside of the one or two dominant platforms out there. And where, in terms of product offerings or customer segments, do you see the best traction around OTT going forward? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think there's certainly a set of aggregators and they are growing and also the broadcasters going out directly as well. That is growing. And I think right now you just see all different avenues being explored by the major content owners and broadcasters. And so I don't see right now a single offer, an aggregated offer hitting the marketplace that would take over. I think you'll see a lot of seeds planted and flowers will bloom. And both aggregation and the broadcasters going direct with their content. And we service all of those entities. We're seeing strong OTT growth among the aggregators as well as the broadcasters who are taking some of their content and making it direct. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, can you just highlight your progress on some of the network cost initiatives that I guess have been underway for a while now? But do you expect to continue to see leverage in the colocation line \u2013 expense line? And I see server count picked up a bit again this quarter. So what should we expect going forward in terms of the server count? Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, yeah, we're always working on lowering our costs to try and to get more bits per second out of each square foot of colo, out of each kilowatt hour, out of each dollar of CPU. And we have a really great track record there. A lot of initiatives underway and I expect to see continued progress. As Jim noted, we're in a situation right now where we do have, in some geographies, capacity that's available. And so you see us in a situation where our CapEx for server purchases is a little bit less than our long term model. And as traffic growth reaccelerates \u2013 and if the traffic growth is quite strong outside of the few accounts that we've talked about, that fills up that capacity and that helps, as well. As you've got fixed cost and you have a little bit extra capacity in some markets that hurts the margins and your costs a little bit. But I think we've had good progress there. We will continue to have good progress, plenty of initiatives underway to improve efficiency. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is (01:03:17) in for Sterling. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of my questions were asked, actually, so maybe just quickly on any impact you might see from Brexit, if you can give us more color on that both on the revenue side and the cost side that will be really helpful. Thanks. James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. There's no real direct impact from Brexit that we see at this point in time. Obviously, there's been currency fluctuations. And so that can change the foreign exchange rates. There can be impact on the equity markets, but I don't see any real impact to our business. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one more question. The final question will come from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the last question. Yeah, hi, Tom, Jim. Give us color, if you may, on how you plan to fundamentally lower the cost of Media Delivery? I hear that you have some interesting technology from Octoshape, peer-to-peer media delivery. I'd like to better understand. Is this a work-in-progress and could it potentially impact Media business margins over the next few quarters? And I have a quick follow-up. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We're investing a great deal to substantially lower the cost of Media delivery. And that, in fact, the Octoshape acquisition, that was part of the acquisition thesis. We've been very happy with that acquisition. It also greatly improves performance at the same time. We are in the process of integrating their technology across our platform. And you will see us be delivering more of our content as we go forward from clients and client devices. In some countries, that is happening already. And it does substantially lower our cost and that enables us to pass on lower pricing for our Media customers. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then, quickly, Tom, on enterprise security, help us understand what is Akamai's sustainable differentiation in enterprise security. We do hear that Cisco, F5 and several of the security pure-plays are quite active in enterprise security, including cloud-based security. So I wanted to understand what would be your differentiation? What different angle would you take in enterprise security? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's a great question. And you will see as the market evolves, you have Akamai, which has expertise in the cloud, has tremendous capacity, has great performance capabilities now bringing very strong security technology into our platform. You have, on the other side, companies that have past experience in security as a box that is purchased and deployed in the enterprise's data center. That world is going away. The security technology needs to move into the cloud. And it's very hard to take technology that was dedicated to a single customer and operated by that customer in their data center and now make it in the cloud to try to make it work on a multi-tenant environment, give it sufficient capacity and make it perform well. And on top of all that make it be affordable. So we have tremendous home field advantage in the cloud compared to the companies that are trying to figure out how to move into the cloud. And I think it's because of this that you see several of the \u2013 some of the well-known box providers now being bought by private equity or looking for ways to evolve the company, because it is hard to take what they have and produce the kind of capabilities that Akamai can now offer in the cloud. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. This has been very helpful. Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Tom Barth - Head- Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, Latoya. And in closing, we'll be presenting at a number of investor conferences and events throughout the remainder of the quarter. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section at Akamai.com. And we thank you for joining us and wish everyone a nice evening. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Akamai Technologies Incorporated Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone, and we appreciate you joining Akamai's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. But before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and involve a number of factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on October 25, 2016. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was a strong quarter for Akamai with accelerated growth in our Cloud Security and Web Performance Solutions, an excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the third quarter was $584 million, up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q3 was $0.68 per diluted share, up 10% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $172 million, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $444 million, up 146% over the same period from last year. As we discussed during our last call, our overall revenue growth rates have been lower this year because of the do-it-yourself, or DIY, efforts by a few of the Internet's largest platform companies. If we exclude the impact of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix from our results, then our Q3 revenue was $526 million, which is up 15% over Q3 of last year. It's important to note that our future exposure to DIY on these accounts is now more limited than in prior quarters, since these six companies collectively accounted for 10% of our total revenue in the third quarter, down from 17% in Q3 of last year. As I stated in past calls, while any company could, in theory, build their own CDN, I believe that such an approach is simply not practical for the vast majority of our customers, especially when you consider the scale that is now needed to defend a website against cyber attacks. As a result, while I expect that there will be some further loss of revenue due to DIY efforts going forward, I believe that the continued strong growth of our core business means that we are very well-positioned to reaccelerate our overall revenue growth rate in 2017. I was especially pleased to see the accelerated growth rate for our Web Performance and Cloud Securities Solutions in Q3. Our Security products generated $95 million of revenue in Q3, up 46% year-over-year. Overall, the revenue from our Performance and Security products was up 19% year-over-year. Performance and Security were also top of mind for the over 2,200 attendees from 42 countries at our ninth annual Customer Conference in San Francisco last week. At the conference, we shared Akamai's vision for the future of the Internet and we demonstrated our next generation of services, which are focused on providing the utmost in quality, scale, agility and security for online applications. In addition, nearly 100 customers led discussions on topics such as the future of streaming television, personalized mobile experiences, the digital transformation of the enterprise, the proliferation of connected devices, and the evolving cyber security landscape. Many speakers commented on the unique value that Akamai is providing for their online businesses. One, in particular, described how improving the performance of their web applications had led to a $1 billion of increased revenue with 80% of this amount being attributed to their use of Akamai services. For those of you who are interested, videos of this presentation, as well as several others, including my keynote address on the future of the Internet, are available at our website at www.akamai.com. I'm pleased to report that the innovation engine at Akamai has been running at full speed and at the conference, we showcased some of our most exciting new solutions, including Image Manager, Enterprise Threat Protector, and Enterprise Application Access, as well as the next generation of our very successful Ion, Kona Site Defender, and Bot Manager solutions. We also demonstrated several new SDKs that are designed to enable our customers to easily embed Akamai software into their applications. By embedding our software into their apps, our customers can achieve faster performance, better video quality, stronger security, and in many cases, lower costs. We can also preposition content on the devices, which enables our customers to deliver a high quality experience, even when a device doesn't have good connectivity to the Internet. As you might imagine, the most pressing topic of concern at the conference was security. As the denial of service attacks last Friday demonstrate, the scale and sophistication of cyber attacks are rapidly increasing, along with the potential for disruption and damage. To make matters worse, attackers are now exploiting the Internet of Things to greatly increase the scale of their attacks. This is an area where Akamai's unique architecture and world-class security platform continue to make a critical difference. We have an excellent track record of successfully defending our customers against the web's largest and most nefarious attacks. That's because we have made substantial investments in innovative defense technology and because we place our servers at the edge of the Internet, where there is vastly more capacity than in centralized cloud data centers. As bad as last week's attacks were, I believe that much worse is yet to come. Hundreds of millions of devices are connecting to the Internet every year and most are just as vulnerable as the DVRs and security cameras that were used in the Mirai botnet attacks last week. Already this year, the number of DDoS attacks launched against our customers has more than doubled over 2015, and the number of reflection attacks is up by more than a factor of three. Soon, we'll likely be measuring the size of such attacks in terabits per second. To address these concerns, we are continuing to develop new and innovative security offerings. In Q1, we plan to expand our offerings with the launches of Kona Site Defender 5.0 and Bot Manager 2.0. The next version of Kona Site Defender will add protection for API endpoints to help secure not only websites, but also mobile infrastructure and other API-driven requests. Our next gen Bot Manager will feature enhanced bot detection and mitigation capabilities and stronger policy enforcement, based on business needs. In addition to protecting websites and applications, we have also been developing services to help protect enterprise employees and infrastructure against phishing, malware and data exfiltration attacks. Phishing is now the leading delivery vehicle for malware and ransomware, and malware is becoming increasingly more sophisticated, often bypassing existing blacklist based security solutions, and exploiting less protected threat factors such as DNS. In response to these growing enterprise security risks, we plan to launch our new Enterprise Threat Protector, or ETP, service early next year. ETP provides a cloud-based recursive DNS service for enterprises that blocks access to malware sites and data exfiltration botnets. At the conference, we also demonstrated our new Enterprise Application Access service for securing enterprise apps. This service leverages software obtained through our recent acquisition of Soha Systems, and it addresses the growing need for businesses to more easily and effectively manage application access to a growing mix of users with different risk profiles. For example, many companies want to manage access differently for their employees, contractors, partners, and other third parties. This is difficult to do using traditional solutions such as VPNs. Our new offering also removes the security risk inherent in traditional solutions of poking holes in firewalls to prevent access. And it provides access on a per app basis, which further enhances security over traditional VPN solutions. The apps themselves can reside anywhere. For example, they can be hosted in a data center behind a traditional firewall or in a public cloud environment. App access is simple to deploy and simple to manage. Customers can implement it in minutes and best of all, they can then easily leverage Akamai's other Performance and Security Solutions for all of their internal applications. Q3 was also an active quarter for our Media team. Our OTT business continued to grow at a strong rate, and we achieved several records for the broadcast of live events online. Following a record breaking Euro 2016, we delivered a highly successful Rio Olympics and provided 43 broadcasters around the world with more than 10,000 hours of support. Akamai monitored the entire event from our award-winning Broadcast Operations Control Center, and we delivered an unprecedented online viewing experience for over 100 million unique users. Our platform streamed over 3 billion minutes of Olympic content, most of which was live, and we set a new record of 255 petabytes in total traffic delivered over the 19 days of the games. Later in the quarter, we also delivered a keynote event for a customer that exceeded 11 terabits per second of live traffic which is a record for a single event. I believe that our experience and expertise in streaming high quality, global events at scale, reinforces our unique position to benefit from the increasing demand for high quality video online. In summary, I'm confident that Akamai's business and market position remains strong and I'm excited about the significant opportunities for growth that lie ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q3 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q4. Jim? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom just outlined, Akamai had a strong third quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Q3 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $584 million, up 6% year-over-year, or up 5% adjusted for foreign exchange movement, and up 15% if you exclude the six large Internet platform customers Tom just mentioned. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was particularly strong, coming in at $345 million, growing 19% year-over-year, and was the driver of our revenue overachievement in the quarter. Performance and Security Solutions now make up nearly 60% of our total revenue. We are very pleased with the continued revenue diversification into our more highly differentiated, higher margin offerings. Within this solution category, we saw an acceleration of year-over-year growth for both our Cloud Security and Web Performance Solutions. Our Protect and Perform go-to-market strategy continues to resonate with both our existing and new customer base globally. Third quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $95 million, up 46% year-over-year. Exiting Q3, our Security business is rapidly approaching an annualized revenue run rate of $400 million. We are extremely pleased with the continued strong customer adoption of our unique and differentiated Cloud Security capabilities, and our recently launched Bot Manager offering. And as Tom mentioned, we plan to continue to invest in product innovation, and broaden our capabilities in the security space to drive additional growth. Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $188 million in the quarter, down 14% year-over-year. As we have discussed over the past year, the impact of DIY efforts in a few of our large Internet platform customers continued to weigh heavily on growth rates in the solution category. Excluding the six large Internet platform customers, Media Delivery revenue was up 5% year-over-year. This growth rate was slower than what we've seen in the past several quarters, partially due to a difficult comparison to the strong Q3 of 2015 when we had several large favorable one-time items in our Asia Pacific region, and partially from more and more customers upgrading their services from basic Media Delivery products to higher performing Web Performance products. And while this product migration lowers our Media Delivery growth rates, we view it as a net positive for Akamai, since our Web Performance products tend to be stickier with our customers. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $51 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. We continue to see strong service attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise class professional services globally. Turning now to our customer division results, revenue from our Web Division customers was $285 million, up 17% year-over-year. We continue to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our Cloud Security offerings. Revenue from our Media Division customers was $284 million in the quarter, down 4% year-over-year, but up a healthy 12% excluding the impact of the six large Internet platform customers. Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $15 million in the quarter, up 43% year-over-year. Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q3, consistent with last quarter, and up four points from Q3 last year. International revenue was $180 million in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year, or up 17% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $3 million on a year-over-year basis and no impact on revenue on a sequential basis. Third quarter revenue from our U.S. market was $404 million, up 1% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers are based in the U.S., and weighed heavily on the U.S. market's results. Outside of these customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business. Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 76%, consistent with Q2 levels and down a point from the same period last year, and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 65%, up one point from the prior quarter and down two points from the same period last year. GAAP operating expenses were $268 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $207 million, up about $5 million from Q2 levels and coming in near the low end of our guidance. We received the first payment from Limelight in Q3, as part of the recent resolution of our long-running patent litigation. This expense offset was not factored into our guidance and was the main driver of why non-GAAP cash OpEx came in a little lower than we expected. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $238 million, up $7 million from Q2 levels and up $16 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41%, up one point from both Q2 levels and the same period last year, and above the high end of our guidance, driven by our revenue overachievement and the Limelight payment that I just mentioned. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $85 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million, down slightly from Q2 levels and below the low end of our guidance due to the timing of network deployments. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $164 million, up $7 million from both Q2 levels and the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28%, up one point from Q2 levels and down one point from the same period last year, and one point above the high end of our guidance. Moving on to other income and expense items, interest income for the third quarter was roughly $4 million, up slightly from Q2 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the third quarter was $76 million, or $0.43 of earnings per diluted share, down 12% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $120 million, or $0.68 of earnings per diluted share, up 10% year-over-year and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range, driven by higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and a slightly favorable tax rate. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $36 million, based on an effective tax rate of 32%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million, based on an effective tax rate of 29%. This tax rate is about a point lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was approximately 176 million shares, down slightly from Q2 levels, as a result of increased share buyback activity. Now, I will review some balance sheet items. Day sales outstanding for the third quarter was 56 days, down two days from Q2 levels. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $87 million, or 15% of revenue, and in line with our guidance for the quarter, 15% is slightly below our long-term model of 16% to 18%, as we continue to monitor traffic levels and invest in network expansion accordingly. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities. Cash flow generation continued to be extremely strong in Q3. Free cash flow was $172 million in the third quarter, or 29% of revenue, and $444 million year-to-date, or 26% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very healthy, with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $1 billion. During the quarter, we spent $95 million on share repurchases, buying back 1.8 million shares. As of Q3 end, we had approximately $773 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. And as we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. And given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, our share repurchase authorization is intended to continue our multi-year capital allocation plan, to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders, depending upon business and market conditions. In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q3, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, holiday seasonality plays a large role in our performance, driven by online retail activity for our e-commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. As a result, the fourth quarter remains the hardest to predict. In addition, we expect foreign exchange headwinds from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past few weeks. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q4 revenue of $3 million sequentially. Factoring in these variables, we are expecting Q4 revenue in the range of $593 million to $613 million. To frame this guidance range, if the holiday \u2013 online holiday season is particularly strong, we would expect to be near the higher end of the revenue range. If the online holiday season is not as strong, then we would expect to be towards the lower end of the range. At these revenue volumes, we expect Q4 cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 66%, both up one point from Q3 levels. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $222 million to $227 million, up roughly $20 million from Q3 levels. This sequential increase is larger than we have seen in recent years and is driven primarily by two factors. First, we will be absorbing both the Soha and the Concord acquisitions; and second, as I shared with you on the previous calls, we are continuing to make important investments to drive incremental R&D innovation, targeted spending in both areas aimed at fueling long-term growth and scale. Taking into account the items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of 39% to 40%. As I've said in the past, factors that would impact our EBITDA margin profile would be M&A activities and revenue volumes quarter to quarter. And as we absorb the Soha and the Concord acquisitions, they will weigh on the EBITDA margins in the near term. And while I'm not providing specific guidance beyond Q4, as I said in our last earnings call, EBITDA margins may dip into the high 30%s in 2017. Moving on to depreciation, we expect Q4 non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $74 million to $76 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 27% to 28% for Q4. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.65 to $0.70. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $49 million to $52 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $82 million to $87 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. For the full year, this level of CapEx would equate to 15% of revenue, slightly under our long-term model of 16% to 18% of revenue. In closing, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the business, and we remain confident in our strategy, and our ability to reaccelerate revenue growth and execute on our long-term plans. Thank you. And Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : And our first question comes from the line of James Breen of William Blair. Your line is now open. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Just two. One, I guess for Tom, the revenue for the big six came down just a little bit sequentially. What gives you confidence that that's moderating and eventually can grow from current levels or slightly below current levels? And then secondly, just on the M&A you did this quarter, was there any impact to this quarter's numbers from that? And can you just talk about the capabilities those two companies brought? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Hi, sure. On the big six, I would expect some small further declines in the revenue there in the near term. It's hard to predict the longer term. As we've talked about, they do have their own do-it-yourself platforms. I think we perform very well and offer a very compelling service at a compelling price point, but I think some companies are just so large that they feel its core that they have that capability themselves. Now, of course, the impact will be less going forward, because now it's 10% of our revenue, instead of a lot more. In terms of the acquisitions, I'll let Jim comment on the numbers there. But in terms of their capabilities, Concord Systems helps us with managing big data. We think it's important for our IoT initiatives, which are in the early stages. Soha Systems has a very compelling technology that we've been a customer of, and really thought it was very important. It allows you to grant access to an enterprise application on a per app, per user basis, without poking holes in your firewall, without reconfiguring your VPN, without shipping a laptop to an employee or a contractor or a partner halfway around the world. You're set up in minutes. You can grant access in minutes. And it's a heck of a lot more secure. It's also very synergistic with our services, because now it enables us, once we're providing the access for the app, we're actually delivering the app and we can accelerate it and provide security for the app, which is increasingly important as enterprise networks move into the cloud and the applications move into the cloud. Jim, do you want to comment on the revenue? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Sure. I mean, relative to revenue, neither company really had much of a revenue stream. And so there's really going to be no impact on revenue as a result of these acquisitions. Now, both of these companies combined probably have between 40 employees and 43 employees. So you can expect that they were going to now incur the expense for these employees. So as I mentioned in the EBITDA guidance, that adding these employees will probably add, call it, $3 million to $4 million of OpEx within the quarter with no corresponding revenue. That's roughly the impact of those two acquisitions. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Sanderson of MKM Partners. Your line is now open. Rob J. Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC : Hi, thanks. A couple of questions. The Web Performance business, this is the best quarter \u2013 result that we've seen in, I don't know, at least two years, I think. What was really the driver of the reacceleration in that business? And then likewise on the Cloud Security growth reaccelerated there as you mentioned in the script, was this really driven by the launch of new products primarily? And also since that's a recurring revenue SaaS business, is the revenue upside really imply a much greater outperformance on the bookings side? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So in Web Performance, we have the Ion product line which is really achieving scale now. We have a new solution with Image Manager and they both contributed to the strong performance in Q3 and I'm really excited about Ion 3.0 that'll be coming out early next year, which focuses on mobile apps and performance in difficult environments such as cellular networks and I think that is a great area of potential for us. In Cloud Security, bookings are very strong and we have the next generation of the existing products. Bot Manager is relatively new and doing great. We have client reputation, which is also doing well and now we'll have going out next year not \u2013 as Jim said, not contributing a lot of revenue now, but two enterprise security products. So I think we're very excited about the potential for future growth in the security products suite. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Operator? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks so much. Can you update us on the percentage of your customers that take your security products? And some of the larger denial of service attacks we've seen, were any of these customers, customers of yours or did you have any impact on those DDoS attacks? And I just had a quick follow-up. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, roughly a third of our customer base buy one of our security products. So we still have a lot of room to grow within our existing install base. And there's \u2013 certainly our install base is a little over 6,500 customers. So there's significant room to expand outside the install base with new customers as well. So there's a significant opportunity to continue to grow our security portfolio, not just from adding new adjacent offerings but also penetrating the existing offerings with both existing and new customers. And in terms of the customers that were impacted on Friday, as you know, that was a result of an attack against a DNS provider, called Dyn. If a customer was using Dyn to direct the traffic to a CDN, then there's nothing that we can do about it. Now, in some cases, we had customers that were using Dyn to direct traffic to the origin that we would have to go to. In that case, we were able to overcome Dyn's outage and actually get the content in real-time from those customers. Otherwise, this would have been a lot worse. So we were able to help a lot of our customers through the Dyn attacks. If they were using Dyn and only Dyn for just getting the original direction to a CDN, then there's nothing that could be done unless they were using another provider. That said, we do offer a service called Fast DNS, which has tremendous capacity for DNS resolutions and we have a lot of customers that use that and they were fine. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And Tom, just on the video-on-demand side on the Olympics, can you maybe just describe who your closest competitors are for that product? And how does your service kind of compare to your closest competitors right now for delivering that at scale? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I think at scale is sort of the key. There's a lot of competitors for delivering video and for delivering media, literally dozens. When it comes to delivering events at scale, I think generally, Akamai is where the major companies turn to. That's certainly the case in the Olympics. We handled it for 43 broadcasters around the world. And you see that for most of the major sporting events and online events. And that's because of our scale, because of our quality levels, because of the security. Those events are big targets for attackers, and so security is really important. So in those cases for the large scale events, Akamai is a go-to company. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, thanks. Yeah, hi, Tom, Jim. Congratulations, solid results. Yeah, my question for both of you is on your enterprise business. It seems interesting, the new driver of growth, I would like to understand from both of you the scope and the investment levels you have in mind for this business and would it be primarily targeting, like, application delivery on premises VPNs, or do you have a broader mission for the business? And how should we think about the enterprise business driving top line growth, for example, over the next year? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Well, let me talk a little bit about what the strategy and vision is there, and then Jim can talk about some of the numbers. The goal is to enable enterprise networks to move into the future where their applications are outside the firewall or maybe they're in the cloud. The users are mobile, outside the traditional enterprise structure and to provide acceleration, off-load and security. Starting with access to the application, managing that in a secure and efficient way and then delivery of the application to make it be really fast, to make it work in mobile and cellular environments around the world, to provide security for the enterprise applications so that they are not compromised by malware. Also to protect the enterprise employees, so they are not compromised by malware to protect the enterprise infrastructure. So their emails or their intellectual property is not exfiltrated from the enterprise. And finally to make the enterprise networking be more efficient, enterprise networks are about to go into their next generation, it will look different in the future. And off-loading from congested pipes into branch offices becomes important because the enterprise wants to do things that by training that makes use of video that clogs the enterprise pipes. So the vision is really to support everything the enterprise needs as it evolves its network into the future. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: And I would say from an investment perspective, I mean this business, as Tom mentioned, this is still early stage. And so, if you think back, it was not that many years ago, just three years or four years ago that our security business was kind of called single digit millions and that's roughly the size of what our enterprise business is today. And so you can expect that we're going to continue to invest organically and inorganically as you have seen with the most recent acquisition with Soha in the enterprise space. And as Tom's talked about in the past that we believe the revenue potential in the enterprise business is equivalent, if not bigger than that of our Delivery business and Media, as well as our Performance businesses. So, we are very early stage. I think it's going to be a significant driver of growth for the company. I think it's going to take a while for that business to ramp, but I think we have a proof point of what we have done in security, and this is about basically taking, again, the Akamai platform and now applying it to the enterprise use case. So I think we're quite bullish on the growth opportunities in the long-term for enterprise. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. That's a much longer answer than I expected. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell of JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Hi, this is Rishi Jaluria dialing in for Greg. Thank you for taking my questions. First, just a quick housekeeping question. I know in the past, you've discussed approximately what percentage of revenue came from your two largest customers, separate from the top six. Can we have an idea of what proportion of revenue the top two customers represented in Q3? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: We are not going to disclose the top two. What we've tried to do, and we did it last quarter was to ring-fence the six customers that are large Internet platform customers. Notably, I can tell you that the revenue decline that we saw in that grouping of, call it the big six, that was notably from one of those top two customers. So that will give you a little bit of color based on what we said before. But I think the better way of understanding what's going in the business is to understand what's happening with the large Internet platform customers of the grouping and not specifically nitpicking one or two customers. Because I think, in general, the dynamic that's going on there is, as Tom said, these are all customers that have DIY capability and I think it allows investors to draw their own conclusions around what they think could happen with that customer set. As he mentioned, that customer set represented about 10% of our revenues in Q3, down from 17% Q3 of last year, so you can certainly see that that's about a 40% drop in revenues year-on-year, notably being driven by the top two that we did mention, and more notably, one of those top two is the one that actually declined sequentially. Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And if I'm not mistaken on the last earnings call, you had expected to see revenue reaccelerate in Q1 of 2017. Is that still the expectation that will happen in that quarter, or could it be later than that in 2017? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: We are quite confident that we're going to see a reacceleration of growth in 2017. We did say in the second quarter that we thought that we would see growth in Q1. I think that's certainly our expectation, that I think for sure, we're going to see growth acceleration in 2017. I think based on what we see now, we (40:06 \u2013 40:12). Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Okay. Next question, operator. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you might touch on international, very strong. I understand it doesn't have the headwind of the Media side that the U.S. has, but can you give us an indication of which countries are doing well, which products are doing well, and what your expectations are there? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, we are quite pleased with the performance of our international growth, that we grew 17% in the third quarter. That's a little bit less than what we grew in the first half. We had some difficult compares in our Asia Pacific region. We had a particularly strong Q3 of last year, growing very well in Asia Pac, growing well in Japan. In particular, very notably, there are markets within EMEA that we're growing well in. I think there are still certain markets in the southern economies of the southern markets of Europe that are still a little bit sluggish. But I would say in general, it's across our broad solution set, we are growing well in Media and we're growing well in Performance and Security. As we've said in the past, we have been weighting more of our sales investments over the last few years to the international markets and given the nature of our business being \u2013 especially in the Performance and Security Solutions, more of a subscription business, it takes a while for the revenue to grow and I think you are starting to see the payback from the investments that we have made over the last few years. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: And the headwind \u2013 the currency headwinds that you mentioned, the $3 million, is that everywhere or is that particularly located someplace? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Well, I mean you've seen it. It's mostly in the euro and greater British pound, obviously, fears of what's going on with Brexit have had some volatility with the foreign exchange market. So we are certainly not immune to that. That's largely where we are seeing the revenue impact from. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is now open. John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. This is actually John on for Colby. As it relates to your Performance and Security businesses, were there any one-time items that helped growth within each segment this quarter? And then can you maybe also provide an update on the competitive landscape and the pricing trends you are currently seeing in the marketplace? Thanks. Bye. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Sure. So, yeah, we had very strong growth in Performance and Security of 19%. It was strong, as Tom mentioned, in both Cloud Security and in Web Performance. I'd say, we did get a bit of a benefit that we have a custom government business where we do have some special projects with the federal government, and we had a couple of large deals that closed within the quarter, call it, that probably accounted for a point of growth, but for the most part, it was across all of the product sets that did well. And I forget what your second question was. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I'll get that. Yeah, the competitive landscape in Performance and Security really hasn't changed. There's a lot of companies. Pretty much all of the CDNs will have some sort of acceleration product and a lot of them have some sort of security product. I think what differentiates Akamai is our scale, our track record to really defend against the hard attacks and to give the utmost in performance, especially in mobile and cellular environments, which, of course, are increasingly important. John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. And if I could have one quick follow-up, to what degree are you seeing your customers increasing leveraging a multi-CDN strategy, maybe today versus what you were seeing a year ago? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I don't think there's any real fundamental change there. You see that more commonly in big media accounts. And that's been around forever. I don't think there's any real change in terms of customers that are pursuing multi CDN. Now, in some cases, customers will even tell us that it actually lowers their reliability and quality, because now if one of the CDNs goes down or has a problem, it does take a while for them to deal with that, and so it increases the chances for difficulty. It also increases their overhead, trying to manage several CDNs. The CDNs have different capabilities. Akamai offers a lot of very useful functionality that the other CDNs don't, and so that means you can't always take advantage of it if you are trying to share traffic among CDNs. But it exists, particularly in media and I don't think there's any fundamental change there. John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. I was just taking a look at the CDN revenue ex the Internet platform customers and it decelerated on a year-over-year basis again. I'm just wondering why is this, given the Olympics tailwind that you highlighted. And also, what's the outlook for this segment on a combined basis in 2017? And what's your outlook for the non-Internet platform business in 2017 for the CDN side of the business? Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Right. So you're right, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, that the Media product growth rate slowed from what was, call it, the low double digits in the first half to 5% ex the Internet platform customers in the third quarter. And I mentioned a couple of drivers of it. One is it is a difficult compare in our Asia Pacific region in particular that had very robust Media growth last Q3. And what we're seeing more and more is we're seeing more of our Media customers that were buying kind of a basic Media Delivery product. They're now upgrading. They're upgrading to a higher performing Web Performance Solutions. So some of what you saw for growth deceleration in Media, you saw corresponding growth acceleration in the Web Performance business as customers kind of shifted their products from a Media product to a Web product. The only thing that's important to note is that that's going to happen. One of the reasons why we went to the divisional structure for the company, which is more of a division of customer lens is if you look at our Media Division, its growth rates were 12%. And so product migrations that go from Media to a Web product, when you're looking at it from a customer basis, that it doesn't matter. And so the growth rates in \u2013 when you look at it across the division lens that we had strong growth rates in Web customers. Web customers were 17% growth. We had strong growth rates in our Media customers at 12%. It just so happened that our Media product set that we've seen a little bit of a shift of customers as they migrate from one product to another. And actually, when they do that, they're actually a bit stickier. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So I get that. I guess I'm just wondering \u2013 so the Olympics this year doesn't help offset the comp in Asia-Pac last year. I guess that's one follow-up. And the other question would be then based on what you just expressed and how people are changing their buying, should we expect the CDN business to continue to decelerate then the way you just talked about the reporting and how customer buying is changing? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I'll answer them separately. So certainly on the Olympics that we've said it all along that the Olympics doesn't necessarily drive huge revenue. It drives a little bit of revenue. There are more notable events for what's capable for serving kind of live content across that many people. So it's really a display of capability, more than it is a display of incremental revenue. So it's not as notable as kind of people might think. And I'm not going to provide guidance for 2017 for each one of these segments, but you're right. You may see a bit \u2013 when you look at the product segments, you may see a bit of a share shift from Media to Web. We'll have to see that it \u2013 I think what we've seen notably is some large customers that have migrated from a Media product to a Web product, I don't know how much more notable that's going to be going forward, but there's a possibility that you'll start to see a shift from Media to Web Performance products, but again, when you look at it in a division lens, which I think is a more important way to look at it, that it's strong growth across all the customer sets. And as we said to you that we tend to find that our Performance and Security Solutions are stickier. It represents 60% of our revenue. So from an investor perspective that we're actually starting to see growth acceleration come from the part of our business that is stickier with customers. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. So as you work through the excess capacity created by customers who took CDN traffic in-house, do you see potential for gross margins to stabilize and maybe even improve? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Well, you saw that. Actually our guide shows gross margins expanding in the fourth quarter that we stabilized gross margins at 76%, gross margin guidance for Q4 is 77%, and 66% on the GAAP gross margins. So what we said to you over the last few quarters is exactly what transpired. We built out last year in anticipation of traffic for an OTT offering, didn't happen. It had an impact in the near term on margins. And we said that we would obviously dial back investment in alignment with what we saw for traffic projections. And it's just a matter of what you're starting to see is you're starting to see that play out. So you're starting to see the margins come back to the levels that they were last year. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. That's helpful. And then just one more, if I may. What percentage of your revenue from the top six customers is CDN versus site Performance and Security? Should we just assume that the bulk of that is CDN? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I want to say it's like 80%. 80% plus of it is customers buying a Media product. Now, all those customers sit within our Media Division. So from a customer lens perspective, they're all in our Media Division, but the products that they buy are, I think, 80% plus are Media products. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. But there is some Performance and Security in that disclosure? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes, there is. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and a really nice quarter. I think this is going on a previous question when we were talking about the potential for mix shift into 2017. But how should we think about the margin implications there going more towards Performance and Security versus just the Media? Should that be a positive for operating margins as we've head into 2017? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I mean there are lots of factors that are going to affect the operating margins. I think you're right at the highest level, the gross margins for those products are higher. I think as Tom mentioned, in talking about enterprise that you're going to see us make continued investments in R&D, and so what maybe, if you start to see a mix shift more to Performance and Security, it may benefit gross margins but we're going to make sure we're making the right investments in this new enterprise space. And so I I'm not going to call margin expansion on the operating margin perspective in 2017. In fact, what I said in the prepared remarks is I actually thought that kind of operating margins going into 2017 would likely be pressured because I think what we're going to do is some of the areas that we plan to grow in, in the enterprise space are going to require investment. And we believe that there are huge, huge growth opportunities for the company for the long term. And we're going to make those investments now. And until revenue growth reaccelerates in a more substantive way, that's going to have pressure on EBITDA and operating margins while we make those investments. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And if I could sneak in one follow-up. There's a lot of sort of industry discussion about steep sort of price discounts on sort of the core Media business this quarter. One, is that something that you guys would be willing to talk to, whether there was steeper discounts coming from you guys? And two, is that part of what pressured sort of the non-top six Media growth in the quarter? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No. No. I know what you're referring to that, yeah, there have been bloggers that have talked about pricing. And I can tell you that we look at pricing on a regular basis. And one, I will tell you the Media business is a very competitive business. Price points are always very aggressive, but the pricing environment and our response in the pricing environment is consistent. So we're not seeing a significant change up or down in the pricing environment. It is a very aggressive pricing environment, and we will price to ensure that we maintain and grow share. But I haven't seen it necessarily get better or worse. It's pretty consistent. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Excellent, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire of CLSA. Your line is now open. Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. I was wondering if you could provide a bit more color on the dynamics of Media customers that convert to Performance customers. You talked about the new SDKs that customers can drop into their apps. But could you walk through what really that transition would look like? And how \u2013 where there's the breakpoint in how those customers get classified? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, they might have an object delivery product and which is just basic caching and delivery, if you want to think of it as basic CDN. But they want to have the delivery be faster. They want it accelerated. They want to have more dynamic content and have it be accelerated. So then they might upgrade to a DSA or an Ion. Increasingly, media companies really care about security, so they want all of their content to run through Kona Site Defender and the entry level delivery product there would be DSD, which is a web product. So, what you see them doing is moving from basic object delivery, basic caching into Performance and Security product and that's good. That's a good thing. It is a higher margin business, as Jim said. It's stickier and then from there, once they are more deeply on the platform, we can sell other capabilities, things like Image Manager, Bot Manager, so it's a good mix shift for us. Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. And just a follow-up. With the recent Soha acquisition, the Enterprise Application Access offering does get you into a market that is competitive with the likes of Check Point or Citrix for remote access. Do you have to do any different types of development or how are you thinking about selling this product as there may be a different buyer from who you traditionally have served? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: That's a \u2013 yeah, great point. The buyer is a little bit different for our enterprise products. Now, there's a commonalty with the Chief Security Officer, commonality with the CIO. But the person who is worried about the enterprise network or the enterprise app security or the enterprise apps is often different than the person whose day-to-day job is the enterprise website. That said, we have great relationships in many major enterprises and so it's easy for us to cross over. We do have folks that have special training around the new enterprise products. The beauty of both Enterprise Threat Protector and Enterprise Application Access is they are very easy to integrate and to turn on. And the value proposition is, I think, relatively easy to explain, much easier than things like Kona Site Defender and Ion, for that matter. So I'm very optimistic that it will have success in being able to cross over with the enterprise products. And, yes, we will have a new suite of competitors as we move into the enterprise market. We will be probably seeing the big box providers who are trying to figure out how to move into the cloud. And the big advantage we have is that we know how to work in the cloud very well, with high performance and high security, and then with a shared platform. And that's a big advantage. Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. On these very large DDoS attacks, can you give us a sense of what the cost to actually defend against them? Because I think before Friday's attack, there was a similar very large attack against KrebsOnSecurity that you guys were defending kind of pro bono. I think you stepped away. So is that a material cost to defend the size of one of these attacks? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes, the Krebs attack did share some of the same attacking entities as the Dyn attack, but it was different in that it wasn't going after DNS, it was going after the site itself. And when you have attacks that say are maybe just downloading the site at massive scale, issuing GET requests, you want to think of one of the costs there is just the cost to support all the traffic. Because you may be delivering the traffic or even if you are filtering the traffic, it's coming in to us and that is a cost. Not to mention with very large scale attacks, the human cost of monitoring it, making sure everything is fine and that there's no downstream impacts. So it's like running a very large-scale event at some level for however long the attack goes. So it can be expensive over time. And we \u2013 it gets hard to do that for a long period of time in a pro bono situation in terms of the interest to our shareholders and to the interest of our paying customer base. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Kind of where I'm headed with this is are we seeing an increase in frequency? And there's some concern that the frequency and size of attacks will be increased and actually start to erode gross margin? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No, I don't think in terms of the security business, it's an issue in terms of gross margins. We are certainly seeing rapid increases in the number of attacks as I talked about and rapid increases in the scale and sophistication of the attacks. And that's an area where Akamai really excels. So I think as awareness of what's happening out there increases, that helps drive customer adoption for Akamai because we are really uniquely capable of defending against those kinds of attacks. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. That makes sense. And just last question. We talked about the non-top six, but within the top six, how should we think about 2017 and the different contracts that might be up for renewal on both sides of the fence? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: You are asking about the non-top six? Obviously, with the top six that I think we had shared last time that one of those customers renewed in the first quarter that you can expect that these customers, all of them have contract lives between one and two years each, and so you probably had each one of them are renewing, call it, one of them is renewing each quarter, roughly speaking. And so that's roughly how it's going to continue. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks. I just have two quick ones. First, this is probably splitting hairs and maybe you can't answer it, but at this point, we're just curious how many of the six identified potential DIYs are 2% or more of revenue? Is it just two of them or is it more than that at this point? And second, what is the pace of sales force additions look like at this point? It seems like for two years or three years in a row, you were adding 100 salespeople per year. Are you still adding to that in a big way or is it more maintenance mode for the sales team of plugging holes versus making net adds to the team? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, as far as the big \u2013 the six large net platform companies, I think we said in aggregate, they're 10%. We said the top two in Q2 were 5.5%. They were a little bit less than 5% combined this quarter. So it gives you a frame that there's really none of them beyond our largest customer that \u2013 they are all about 2% or less below them. Actually customers five and six are relatively small. We have included them in the grouping just because they fit the classification of an Internet platform giant. And as far as the sales force is concerned, we continue to make investments in the sales force. We continue to make investments in go-to-market capability all the time. We are not disclosing specifically the number of sales reps. We did that a few years ago because we were kind of doubling down in a much more substantive way, that we were doubling the size of the sales force over the span of a couple of years. So we're not growing the sales force at that rate, by any means. But we continue to kind of add to the sales capability and as Tom mentioned, we will add it based on what we think the growth opportunities are and hire the appropriate skill sets. So you can expect that we will continue to do that going forward. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Bowen of Pacific Crest. Your line is now open. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I guess my question would center around \u2013 with the growth in Media ex the top six around 5%, is that kind of something \u2013 is that range kind of the new normal we should think about? And then second question. With regard to the good holiday selling season, as we watch the holiday season, what are some of the metrics that you would point us to that you guys would define as good or solid as we try to watch the quarter and kind of prognosticate where you are going to be coming in as far as your revenues? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So I will take them in order. So it's tough to say what the Media growth is going to be ex the digital (64:16) platform guys. Yes, they grew 5% in the third quarter. As we've said in the past, that the Media product category is really about traffic and there is a lot of things that cause traffic to kind of ebb and flow, big software releases, gaming releases, more video delivery. So, I don't know if I would say 5% is the new normal. I mean obviously 5% is what we did in the third quarter. I do think it's going to be pressured in that we have had some large customers that have transitioned from buying a Media product, to now \u2013 to a Web product. So in that case, it will be pressured, but I still think there's a significant opportunity for growth in our Media products and \u2013 which is one of the reasons again going back to the divisional lens that we introduced a couple of quarters ago, that's one of the reasons why we grouped customers the way we have, because I think seeing what those customers are doing as a composite, I think, is a more important and meaningful way to look at it. And relative to the holiday season, I mean, you can look at some of the things that we do. You can look at announcements, announcements of, it could be gaming releases. It could be announcements of things that are going to cause more consumption possibly of online activity. It could be the introduction of new offerings, potentially new offerings for over-the-top bundles, things of that nature. Looking at things like ComScore, around what their predictions are going to be for the online e-commerce season. So there's a bunch of things that you can look at to kind of get a gauge. You'll see statistics \u2013 you can't always directly correlate them to how we're going to fare, but they're probably reasonable proof points around whether things are trending in the right direction. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : And if I can sneak \u2013 thanks for that. And if I could sneak one extra one in. When you talked about some of the Media revenue, basically some of that being supplanted by Web Performance. And I don't know if you can answer this, but is some of that Media revenue bleeding off to some of the competitors? Would that be fair to characterize? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No, no, no, this isn't about customers leaving the Media product category and churning. These are customers that are literally the sales rep and the customer having a discussion, as Tom mentioned. And they're upgrading to a higher performing product which happens to sit in our Web Performance product category. So, no, this is not a function of they're migrating and they're migrating, either churning or migrating to a web \u2013 they're migrating to our Web Performance products where that's been the case. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, Michael Turits. Thank you. Two questions, guys. First, you sort of answered this about the reacceleration of growth in 1Q. But first question is, should the top six bottom as you expect it as a percentage of revenue in 1Q? And secondly, you said that there was only the government one point that was a one-timer from P&S. But you are guiding in line with the Street at the midpoint, which kind of implies, assuming the same trajectory in Media, that the P&S returns to its prior growth rates at least based on the guide. So what am I missing? It seems as if there would be more one time based on the guide. So those two questions. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, so I'll take \u2013 relative to the large Internet platform customers that \u2013 again, what we've said is our visibility for these customers in the near term is pretty good. Our visibility for these customers beyond kind of, call it, the next quarter or the next two quarters is certainly less. And it's hard to pick a percentage as you know, because it's a function of what happens with the rest of our business as well. I can tell you that roughly where \u2013 the revenue volumes, as Tom mentioned, we can expect that they're probably going to go down a little bit from where they were in Q3. I don't think you're going to see \u2013 notably, I think these customers as a grouping, they're still going to be a sizable revenue contributor in 2017, whether they're contributing at the levels that they are now or something less than that, it's hard to predict. But I think that they'll still be reasonable sized customers as a grouping, at least for 2017. And relative to \u2013 I'm not exactly sure what your question is around Performance and Security that \u2013 I think the point is that Performance and Security growth rates were 19% in Q3. We saw an acceleration in Web Performance. We saw an acceleration in Cloud Security. What I was suggesting is that outside of that, we had a modest benefit in our custom government projects which probably contributed to about a point of that growth. So call it, the 19% growth. It would have been more like 18% growth had it not been for a couple of large projects. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I guess what I'm just trying to figure out is if that 18% is really a sustainable acceleration, because the guide kind of implies that it's not. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, again, it depends upon what happens, as you know, Michael, in Q4, especially for the Web Performance products in particular. The online commerce season is a big factor on how well that product category will do, because certainly that traffic for the commerce season affects the Web Performance products. And so I'd say there is certainly a chance that its growth stabilizes in Q4 if there's a good and strong online holiday season, or it might dip, but I don't think it'll dip substantially. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Tom. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Will Power of Baird. Your line is now open. Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, great. Thanks. Yeah, a couple of questions. I guess a bit of a follow-up to a couple of earlier ones. I was just thinking about the Q4 revenue guidance. It looks like the implied sequential growth is a bit below past couple of years. It sounds like FX may be a piece of that and then perhaps a further decline in those top six customers. I wonder if it's just that or are there some other pieces we should be thinking about in terms of the sequential compared to past years? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No, I think you're thinking about it exactly right that some of the reasons for the sequential growth in prior periods or prior years was what was going on with the large Internet platform customers, the big two that we talked about in the past that they had been large contributors to Q3 to Q4 sequential growth in the past. That's obviously not the case now. If you exclude those customers, where we look, we expect that the sequential growth rate outside of those Internet platform customers to be roughly consistent with what they've been seasonally the last couple of years. Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just probably not quantitatively, but perhaps qualitatively. You've got some big OTT launches coming from AT&T, the DirecTV Now product here in November. You got Hulu, Google, others, the products in 2017. Yet, it feels like you may be downplaying some of the growth opportunities in Media a little bit. So I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about the magnitude of those opportunities. What they could mean to you if we start to see more meaningful online traffic. Is that something you think could still be a meaningful driver of your business in 2017 or beyond or something maybe changed on that front? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No, absolutely, I think the future of OTT is bright. We have a strong growth already in our revenues for OTT. I do think there's a good chance you'll see numerous OTT efforts launched over the next one to two years. I think we're in a very good position to benefit from many of them, including some of the ones that you mentioned. And I think that can be a very strong driver for revenue growth for us in the future. It's hard to predict how successful each one will be, but I think everybody thinks it's going that way. And as it starts to really materially get there, that's a good thing for us. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, Will, I think we're definitely poised to benefit from that. I think we're obviously a bit cautious, given what we called last year. And obviously it didn't happen to the volumes and levels that we thought. So I think when it does come, I think we will be poised to benefit from that at the time, but when it happens, it remains to be seen. Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Operator, we have time for one more question. I know there's several probably in the queue, but we have time for one more. Operator : Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Your line is now open. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for getting me in. Good evening. Just one more question on the security side, if I could, given the continued increase in size and scale of the DDoS attacks. Could you just kind of give us an update on the competitive landscape? I guess specifically in terms of how quickly do you think the TAM is growing for DDoS mitigation? What customer segments are showing the strongest demand growth? And lastly, have you kind of begun to see an uptick in competition from either carriers or traditional software vendors that are angling more towards cloud-based security products? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I think we are positioned very well in the competitive landscape. The traditional landscape has been dominated by companies that sell you devices that you install in your data center and that just doesn't work anymore. The scale of the attacks makes it really impossible to defend yourself successfully that way. You can't afford enough and you can't get enough connectivity with these large attacks. And what you need really is Akamai because we have such large-scale with our platform, and where we place our service at the edge of the Internet. Even the large cloud data centers cannot scale with these kinds of attacks. So we're uniquely well positioned to defend against the large attacks. I think every enterprise needs to worry about it and I think there will be increased awareness after Friday's attacks that this is a big deal. So I think there's tremendous upside in the TAM across really all of our customer segments. And that's just for the DDoS attacks. Of course, we also sell the Kona Site Defender solution that adds application layer defenses. That's where the bad guys are trying to come in and corrupt your website, and trying to steal your confidential information. And then beyond that, as we talked about, we'll be entering the enterprise security space and that's where the bad guys are trying to infect the employees with malware, trying to exfiltrate sensitive corporate data such as emails, and that's potentially an even larger market down the road. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up \u2013 sorry, if I missed this before. But what was the per share impact of the litigation settlement this quarter? And also how much on a per share basis is factored into your 4Q guidance? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: It's about $4.5 million a quarter and it's recorded as an expense offset. So roughly speaking, call it, roughly $0.02. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And that's \u2013 fourth quarter will be the end of that? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No, the way it has been structured is we are going to receive this over the next three years. And so you will see a quarterly payment of $4.4 million a quarter for basically the next 11 quarters. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So just to square that up with the EBITDA margin guidance, you said that you were positively impacted in 3Q. Does your 4Q guidance incorporate that offset or is it normalized? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes, it does. The 4Q guidance assumes we get $4.4 million again. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Okay. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: So, I want to thank everybody. And in closing, we will be participating at a number of investor conferences and events in both the Americas and in Europe throughout the fourth quarter. Details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And we want to all thank you for joining us and have a nice evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's program, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's fourth quarter and year-end 2016 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements included in this call represent Akamai's view on February 7, 2016. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to further reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, please let me turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai with accelerated revenue growth and excellent earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $616 million, up 7% year-over-year on constant currency. The strong revenue result was driven by robust seasonal traffic in Media, the continued rapid growth of our Cloud Security Solutions, and the success of our recently launched new products. Of particular note, revenue from our Cloud Security Solutions was $102 million in Q4, up 41% over Q4 in 2015. Non-GAAP EPS for Q4 was $0.72 per diluted share, consistent year-over-year and up 8% when adjusted for the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit that benefited Q4 of 2015. Cash generation continued to be strong, free cash flow of $106 million in Q4 bringing full-year free cash flow to $550 million, up 72% from 2015 levels. As we discussed during our recent calls, our overall revenue growth rates in 2016 were lower because of the do-it-yourself or DIY efforts by a few of the Internet's largest platform companies. If we exclude the impact of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix from our results, then our Q4 revenue was $558 million, which is up 15% over Q4 of last year in constant currency. Revenue for 2016 as a whole was $2.3 billion, up 7% year-over-year and up 15% excluding the six large Internet platform companies. Our exposure to DIY in these accounts continue to diminish as they collectively accounted for less than 10% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter, down from roughly 16% a year ago. As a result, our overall revenue growth rate accelerated in Q4 due to the continued strong growth of our core business. As I look back at 2016, I'm especially pleased with the success of Akamai's innovation engine. We released several new products last year, including Bot Manager, Image Manager and Enterprise Application Access, and their reception in the marketplace has been very positive. Bot Manager, in particular, has proven to be our most popular new product in several years. Bot Manager identifies nearly 1,400 types of bots and enables our customers to customize their response to requests based on the type of bot. We sell Bot Manager across all our major verticals and for a variety of uses. I recently spoke to one major enterprise that is saving many millions of dollars a year because of Bot Manager's ability to identify and mitigate price scrapers. Our recent acquisition of Cyberfend is intended to further enhance Bot Manager's market-leading capabilities by providing even greater defenses against credential abuse. For many of our customers, a large fraction of the login attempts are from bots checking to see if stolen user credentials are valid on their sites. Validated credentials are then sold to criminal organizations for exploitation. By incorporating the Cyberfend technology into Bot Manager, we can more effectively stop these attacks then tell our customers which user IDs have been compromised. Our new Image Manager solution has also gotten off to a very strong start in the market. Image Manager automatically optimizes images by creating and delivering the right size image for each user in real time based on the device type, browser type, and quality of connection. The solution enables our customers to accelerate their time to market, improve performance and conversion rates, especially for mobile apps and also to reduce their costs. Last year we formed our Enterprise and Carrier Division, and I'm happy to report that we're now entering the market with two exciting new products to improve enterprise security, Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Detection. Using technology acquired from Soha Systems in October, Enterprise Application Access, or EAA, addresses the growing need for businesses to more easily and securely manage application access for a growing mix of users with different risk profiles. EAA does not require enterprises to poke holes in their corporate firewall to enable access, which greatly improves security over traditional VPN solutions. EAA is also much easier to integrate and use than traditional remote access solutions. Close on the heels of EAA is our new Enterprise Threat Protector or ETP service. ETP is now in beta with 15 customers. It helps companies block access to malware sites and data exfiltration botnets. Just like EAA, Enterprise Threat Protector is very easy to set up. Unlike most enterprise security products, ETP can be deployed and configured in under 30 minutes. Nearly all of the customers in our beta program have been able to get it up and running totally on their own. EAA and ETP are attractive solutions for a wide variety of enterprises providing Akamai with an opportunity to pursue new customers and verticals. For example, manufacturing companies will be able to use ETP to block threats without needing to deploy and maintain on-prem hardware. In addition to our successful new product introductions, our core business also remained strong in 2016 with a especially robust growth in our OTT business. Following a record-breaking Euro 2016 and Rio Olympics, we set a new record for a news event on the night of the U.S. elections, with 7.5 terabits per second of peak delivery, and during the holiday season the Akamai platform achieved a new traffic record of 46 terabits per second, doubling our 2014 peak of 23 terabits per second. The global adoption of OTT has continued at a strong pace, not only in the U.S. but also in EMEA and especially in Asia and Latin America. Our experience and expertise in streaming video at scale with quality and reliability around the world means that we are in an excellent position to benefit from the increasing demand for high-quality content online. Of course, security remains the most pressing concern for many of our customers, as the scale and sophistication of cyber attacks have continued to escalate along with the potential for disruption and damage. In 2016, the number of DDoS attacks launched against our customers grew by 75% over 2015. We're very proud of our excellent track record of successfully defending our customers from some of the Web's largest and most malicious attacks. We believe that our unique approach of leveraging a distributed network of servers at the edge of the Internet, where there is enormous capacity, continues to be a critical differentiator for Akamai. Just this morning, we announced our new Web Application Protector service, which is designed to provide online businesses with a low touch way to protect their websites from the most common attacks. We also announced enhancements to our flagship Kona Site Defender solution to defend APIs from a wide range of both DDoS and application layer attacks. APIs are emerging as a popular target for attackers as the usage of mobile devices continues to grow. Over the last four years, we've grown our Cloud Security business from a little more than an idea into a $400 million market leader. We believe that our remarkable success in Cloud Security demonstrates that with prudent investment, we can create substantial new and profitable revenue streams beyond our core CDN business. As we look to the future, we see several opportunities with similar growth potential, and so we are planning to increase investment in 2017 to capitalize on these opportunities to further accelerate our long-term revenue growth. Our goal is to replicate the success that we've had with our Cloud Security business in other adjacent areas where the scale, resiliency and security of our unique distributed edge platform can enable us to provide compelling cloud solutions to our customers. This investment strategy will pressure margins in the near term, but we believe it will help accelerate revenue growth in the longer term. Of course, as always, we'll continue to keep a close eye on overall expense and to carefully track performance as we grow the business. We'll talk more about our plans for product expansion at our Investor Day on March 14, and as we make key investments. In summary, I remain confident in our business strategy, our market position and our ability to execute on the significant opportunities for growth that lie ahead. I have never been more optimistic about our future. I'll now turn the call to Jim to review our Q4 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q1. Jim? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom outlined, Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom lines. Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $616 million, up 6% year-over-year or up 7% adjusted for foreign exchange movements. Revenue was up a healthy 15% if you exclude the six large Internet Platform Customers Tom just mentioned. Revenue growth continued to be solid across the business with the overachievement versus our guidance driven by a higher-than-expected uptick in holiday season traffic with our Media Solutions and customers. I mentioned in our last call that holiday season traffic would play a large role in where we would land relative to our fourth quarter guidance, and it did. Media-related traffic was particularly strong in the quarter. Before I get into the revenue details, please note that all revenue growth rate references will be in constant currency. Revenue from our Media Delivery Solutions was $196 million in the quarter, down 10% year-over-year, but up 8% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers. We saw healthy seasonal traffic growth in both our gaming and software download verticals and continued robust growth in video delivery. Turning to our Performance and Security Solutions, revenue was $367 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. Within the Solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines. As Tom mentioned, we have been seeing strong traction with our recently launched Image Manager and Bot Manager solutions, and we have continued to see significant growth and demand for all of our Cloud Security offerings. Fourth quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $102 million, up 41% year-over-year, capping off another tremendous year of revenue growth and customer adoption of our security solutions globally. Exiting Q4, our Security business now has an annualized revenue run-rate of over $400 million. We are very pleased with the growth and execution of our Cloud Security business over the past few years. This growth was driven by targeted product innovation and go-to-market resource investments, as well as a very successful acquisition. We plan to maintain this aggressive investment posture to further broaden not only our Cloud Security offerings, but also our Web performance and emerging enterprise solution capabilities where we see substantial long-term growth potential. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $53 million in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. Turning now to our Q4 customer division results, revenue from our Web Division customers was $300 million, up 14% year-over-year. We continued to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our Cloud Security offerings. Revenue from our Media Division customers was $301 million in the quarter, roughly flat year-over-year and up 15% excluding the impact of the six large Internet Platform Customers. This strong growth rate was driven not only by Media Division customers driving more holiday season traffic. but also from upgrading and penetrating more of Akamai's solutions deeper into this customer base. Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $15 million in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year. Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q4, consistent with the prior quarter. International revenue was $193 million in the fourth quarter, up 19%, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of just under $2 million on a year-over-year basis and a $6 million impact on a sequential basis as the dollar strengthened significantly through the quarter. Revenue from our U.S. market was $424 million, up 2% year-over-year. If you exclude the large Internet Platform Customers, which are based in the U.S., revenue growth was a solid 13% across the rest of the business. Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, up 1 point from Q3 levels, consistent with the same period last year and in-line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, up 2 points from Q3 levels, consistent with the same period last year and a point higher than our guidance due to the strong revenue achievement. GAAP operating expenses were $289 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $230 million, up $23 million from Q3 levels. This was above the high-end of our guidance, driven by increased year-end commission costs associated with the revenue overachievement, as well as a significant uptick in litigation spend associated with our Limelight patent infringement cases. Moving in to 2017, we expect to see similar elevated levels of litigation spend. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $247 million, up $9 million from Q3 levels, and $10 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down 1 point from Q3 levels and from Q4 last year, and in line with our guidance. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $84 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million consistent with Q3 levels and at the low end of our guidance due to the timing of some network deployments that shifted into Q1. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $174 million, up $10 million from Q3 levels and up $6 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28% consistent with Q3 levels and down 1 point from the same period last year and at the high end of our guidance. Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the fourth quarter was about $4 million, consistent with Q3 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $92 million or $0.52 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $126 million or $0.72 of earnings per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range driven by higher revenues and a slightly lower tax rate. Adjusting for the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in Q4 2015, earnings grew 8% year-over-year. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $34 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 27%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $50 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 28% and coming in about 2 points lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings. For the full year, the 2016 non-GAAP effective tax rate was just above 29%. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 175 million shares and in line with our guidance. Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Day sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was 54 days, down 2 days from Q3 levels. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $78 million and slightly below our guidance for the quarter primarily due to the timing of network buildouts that moved into Q1. For the full year 2016, capital expenditures came in at 14% of revenue and below our long-term model as we grew into our existing capacity from the significant 2015 buildouts. We expect 2017 capital expenditures to be back in line with our long-term model range. Cash flow generation continue to be strong in Q4. Free cash flow was $106 million in the fourth quarter and $550 million for the year or 24% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you'll factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $1 billion. During the quarter we spent $79 million on share repurchases buying back roughly 1.3 million shares. For the year, we spent $374 million buying back approximately 7 million shares. In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of growth for the company. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see a normal sequential revenue decline for seasonality, perhaps a bit more pronounced in the recent years due to the particularly strong media performance this past quarter. In addition, we expect further currency headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar over the past few months. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue of just under $4 million sequentially and $5 million compared to Q1 of last year. Factoring in both of these variables, we are expecting Q1 revenue in the range of $596 million to $610 million. At the higher end of this range, year-over-year growth would be 8% constant currency, a slight acceleration from Q4 levels. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 76% and GAAP gross margins of 65%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $217 million to $222 million, down seasonally from Q4 levels primarily due to less commission spend and fewer customer events. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 39% to 40%. And as mentioned earlier, we plan to significantly increase our investment levels in 2017 in new product innovation, service delivery enablement and platform scaling \u2013 important areas we believe will help us enable to drive accelerated, sustainable long-term growth and scale. And while we're not providing specific guidance beyond Q1 during this call, we want to be transparent about our plans to grow investments throughout 2017 at a faster pace than revenue growth. Our goal is to re-accelerate the top-line growth back into double-digit levels in the longer-term. We are confident the success we have had with our Cloud Security investment strategy can be duplicated in other areas of the business, most notably in our new and emerging Enterprise Solutions portfolio. We also plan to broaden our offerings within our Security, Web Performance and Media Solutions portfolios. This deliberate investment strategy will result in EBITDA margins in the high 30s in 2017 and for the foreseeable future. Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $74 million and $76 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 27% to 28% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.69. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $48 million to $51 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of just under 29.5%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 175 million shares. On CapEx, we expect a significant uptick from recent spending levels in both the first quarter and throughout 2017. This increase is driven partly by some platform deployments that shifted from Q1, but mostly by our desire to continue expanding our secure delivery network and increasing capacity to support our rapidly growing Security business. We expect to spend approximately $90 million and $96 million, excluding equity compensation. It's also worth noting that our planned investment increases in product innovation and scaling our platform will impact CapEx as well as OpEx as we capitalize more R&D development. As such, we expect CapEx spending to return to our long-term model range of 16% to 18% of revenue in 2017. And with the increasing CapEx, you will also see an uptick in depreciation levels throughout 2017. In closing, Akamai accomplished a great deal in 2016, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and future trends at our upcoming Investor Summit in Boston on March 14. Thank you. And now Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. You talked about these \u2013 the contribution from the three newer products \u2013 Bot Manager, Image Manager and the Enterprise and Carrier Division products. Could you help us think through the revenue ramp? In other words, how widely sold across the verticals are all three of those products? And when do you think that they'll be at a point where they'll be fully penetrated? Does that take 6 months, 12 months, 2 years? Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I'll take that. But as you can imagine with new products, it's going to take a fair amount of time to actually fully penetrate them at installed base. But as Tom said, for both of these products, Bot Manager launched earlier in the year, Image Manager launched mid-year. Bot Manager in particular, this is the fastest-growing product we've had in a long, long time, and so the penetration is still early days. But it was a reasonably meaningful contributor to growth in Q4, in particular, our Performance and Security portfolio. You'll see that continue to ramp and further penetrate in 2018, but it's probably going to take a couple of years to see it kind of fully penetrated. As an example for Cloud Security, which we've been in market now for a little over four years. I think about 38% of our customers via Cloud Security Solutions. So still a lot of ramp to go even in Cloud Security, so it takes a while to have those customers ramp, but you can certainly see that we started a few years ago from roughly a few million dollars in Cloud Security to now over $400 million. So I think these new product offerings are kind of again proof points to Tom's comments that innovation is alive and well, and there's more to sell to the installed base to accelerate growth of the company. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Maguire from CLSA. Your question, please. Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could discuss the competitive environment for your anti-DDoS services, particularly with AWS getting into the market. What sort of competition are you seeing there, and are there also other opportunities where you are seeing cross-selling and attach for the anti-DDoS services? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. We're in a good position with the DDoS solution because of our unique distributed platform. We're in a position to defend and absorb the largest attacks out there, and we've got a great track record and there's a lot of other folks that offer scrubbing services or DDoS services of one kind or another, and they've all pretty much had high profile failures. AWS, we don't see really much in the marketplace. For DDoS, it would be a different kind of approach. So we don't see that as being a significant threat to the DDoS business. And DDoS is relevant for most of our customer base, so there's a lot of cross-selling that takes place and the Security Services, in general, were leading with a sale there and a lot of new accounts where they will join with Akamai because either our DDoS solution or our application layer protection capabilities with Kona and that brings new customers to Akamai. Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. And just to follow up on the \u2013 with the declines in revenue from the Internet Platform Customers, do you believe that you've reached a point of stability where the predictability of the migration away from your platform has reached an equilibrium of sorts? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. As we talked about, they're now collectively less than 10% of our revenue so the future impact is obviously limited, and we expect to see some further decline, but nothing to scale that we've seen over the last one to two years. Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz from Stifel. Your question, please. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wondering if you could go in a bit more detail about some of the enterprise opportunities you're investing in outside of security, I guess, specifically on the Web performance side, and how you see those kind of markets transpiring today from a sales standpoint whether there's head count additions you need to make to broaden the distribution and kind of how those products are attaching alongside the Security Solutions? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Right. As we talked about with Image Manager that's a Web Performance Solution, very pleased with the early traction there. The new Ion 3 (31:30) solution has an SDK for a substantially improved performance especially for mobile devices and prepositioning of content. And as we make major investments this year, we'll talk about those as we make them. And we move into a new product area, then we'll talk about it then. Of course, it will be important that it's synergistic with the existing business and that can leverage Akamai's unique distributed platform. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then just one other on the share count guidance. It looks like you're kind of looking at a flat year-over-year share count. Just wondering if the increased CapEx expectations is at all kind of limiting the buyback in 2017 relative to what you repurchased in 2016? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Not at all, not at all, that our balance sheet has a lot of firepower to do M&A, to do CapEx purchases and to do our share buyback. And as we talked about, our share buyback is intended to offset dilution, but it's a programmatic trade that buys more shares when the stock price is lower and buys fewer shares when the stock price is higher. But we have ample firepower to do full CapEx purchases, share buyback and M&A. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha from B. Riley. Your question, please. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thank you very much. I can understand if you don't want to talk about some of these new adjacencies that you're entering into, but can you give us what the profile of the company would look like? Are these products primarily SaaS-based so that you have an initial CapEx spend, but maybe at a later time that CapEx spend goes down and you get what you listed as a recurring revenue stream? And the second question would be, any initial take on net neutrality? Obviously, the new administration is taking a pretty tough stance. Where do you think you stand on that? And do you think you'll benefit from it or potential negatives some point down the line? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, of course. We're in a business with recurring revenue streams, and so any new areas we would go into you would think would be consistent with that model. So I wouldn't expect any major deviation there. In terms of acquisitions we've done over the past, there's technology tuck-ins. Sometimes there's a product like Prolexic that's an adjacency that fits very well with our existing business, but is a new product that's very synergistic. And occasionally, over our 20-year history we've done some roll-ups. It's less frequent, I would say. And I don't think there would be a major difference in the kinds of things that we're planning to do this year from what we've done in the past. With net neutrality, I think there's going to be changes there with the new administration. I think a lot of rules that existed before may go away, and I don't think that really makes much difference to our business. We weren't regulated in the first place, and I don't see anything coming there that would be bad in any way for Akamai. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thank you Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell from JMP Securities. Your question, please. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is Richard Deloria (35:04) dialing in for Greg. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to kind of follow up on the head count question that was asked earlier, I mean because we did see a bit of an uptick in hiring this quarter. With the increased product development focus and maybe a little bit more of a vertical focus within the Enterprise Division, how are you thinking about head count going forward not just for next quarter and later into 2017 but kind of beyond that? Can you see a return to normal head count growth that we've seen in the past? Or is it going to be a little more deliberate? And I have one follow-up. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. We're certainly going to see a step-up in head count investments. You're right that we have a little bit more head count ramp here in the fourth quarter, but we hired for the year about a little over 400 people, I think, including some acquisitions. I think in years past, we averaged more than 1,000 hires per year. I think what you're going to see is that this step-up in investment is that our head count ramp is probably going to be more similar to what it's been historically than it was this past year, and as I mentioned it's going to be targeted but very heavily focused in new product innovation. There's also investment we're going to need to be making in our service delivery enablement that I mentioned, that our Services business is growing quite rapidly. And we're going to be making investments in continuing to scale the platform. So you should expect head count more similar to what it's been in the past than basically what it's been in 2016. Unknown Speaker : Okay. And then just kind of a quick follow-up. Jim, you did say just in terms of looking at the Q1, we can expect a bigger sequential decline from Q4 to Q1 on a revenue basis than typically we've seen, and just wanted to understand how much of that is being driven by, like you said, the outperformance on the Media side? And how much of that is a continued expectation of \u2013 and I know it's not as significant as before but just the continued declines of revenue from the top six Internet Platform Customers? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Well, yeah, I mean, as Tom mentioned that we probably will see continued decline in the Internet Platform Customers in the first quarter; one, because seasonally they declined Q4 to Q1 anyways, because they also have a seasonally stronger Q4. But I'd say the bigger component of it is not that, and it's more that we had a very strong Q4 for Media. Media traffic was kind of seasonally very, very strong. We had a large number of gaming releases, a fair number of software download events that the Media business can be a bit spiky that way. So some \u2013 I'd say the bigger part of the sequential decline is driven by the Media business, certainly not the performance in Security Solutions. Unknown Speaker : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Hi, Tom, Jim. A consistent question I hear from clients is whether Akamai is an episodic growth story, and I think where they're coming from is the Media Delivery business does extremely well during live events. We saw recently the elections, holiday season, on and on. I think what they're looking for is any data points or trends you could help us with to get all of us comfortable about the slow to mid-teens trajectory for the Media business now that we're lapping to DIY customers. And 2017 is a prime number year, so how would we feel comfortable with no major live events on the calendar this year? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I don't know if it has too much to do with prime numbers. Even years there are more events, but as we've talked about in the past, any given event gives us some revenue, but it's not really swinging the needle. Now sometimes with Olympics and so forth new devices will come out and someday like VR, for example, we've started to do some of that, and that can drive traffic levels on a more sustained basis afterwards. But I wouldn't read a lot into that, and I think the Media business is very healthy. We're seeing very strong growth in OTT, very strong growth in our gaming customers and just Modulo the very big, the six platform companies that are doing more on their own, the Media business has been very good. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I think it's also fair to comment that even outside of Media that I think the company is certainly much more diversified now than it was kind of even a year ago or two years ago, that our performance in Security business now represents 60% of the company's revenue, you include kind of services, call it 70-plus percent of the revenue. So Media is becoming a much smaller percentage of the company's revenue, and we know that the Media business can have variability just given the nature of the business. So I think what you're going to see going forward is that you're going to see more stability in the company's growth rates. I do think that there is an opportunity for Media to reaccelerate growth rates, but I think the catalyst for that is really going to be a significant uptick in Over the Top viewing. And I think we're seeing steady growth in that area right now. But if you see that become more mainstream, I think we're poised to benefit significantly from that. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. A quick follow-on would be, do you see any cross-sell, upsell synergies between your gaming customers and DDoS? A common complaint from gamers is performance is weak because of DDoS attacks, hacker attacks, et cetera. And I think, they complain no matter what, but still do you see any synergies in gaming and the Security business? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, you're right. I think the gaming vertical is probably as attacked as any. And so they are large adopters of DDoS prevention services from Akamai. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Nice quarter, guys, and thank you for taking the question. Following up on OTT, just to kind of help us mark-to-market, you talked about the steady growth. One, are we getting to a point where it's actually sort of materially driving the numbers in either Media or Performance in terms of that's a significant driver of revenues today? And two, when we think about the uptick in CapEx spend into 2017, is that by any means based upon an anticipation of more OTT revenues, or is it more of the traditional businesses that are growing out that (41:48) CapEx? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I'll parse that. So, certainly on the OTT side that, yeah, we're seeing very steady growth in OTT. It's been that way for some time, but it's steady growth, so it's much more consistent growth in Over The Top than say gaming or software downloads, which tend to be much more variable based on games that get released or software updates that occur. And I'd say that has been the bigger catalyst driving growth in the Media business that those \u2013 the gaming and the software download area tends to be much more spiky. And you'll have surges at times and then it won't at other times. So I think the catalyst for growth in the Media business is going to be OTT. I don't think you're going to see the catalyst. You may see even a catalyst, as Tom mentioned, as you see more VR and things like that in the gaming space that require performance to work well, but I think that between things like that and OTT, that's going to be the cause of kind of re-acceleration in the Media business. And on your CapEx question, I'm glad you asked, because we certainly are not trying to signal that we're doing a build-out for some anticipation of further OTT. Actually, the build-out that we're doing is, as you can imagine, our Security business now is on an annualized run-rate of over $400 million. It's rapidly growing. And so there's build-out we're doing to support our Security business. And there's also build-out that we're doing with our secure delivery network. More customers want to have their traffic served over a secure delivery network, so we're building out capacity in that area. So it's really for other parts of the business. It's not so much for the Media business. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you. That was very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. On the Security business, you mentioned like it's already $400 million run-rate, while also you invested and you made a few tuck-in acquisition second half of last year and also introduced new products, I'm wondering how big is an opportunity at this point to cross-sell this within your installed base. How much penetrated at this point? And how sustainable is this 40% growth in Security business? And I have a follow-up. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Well, the cross-sell opportunity is very strong. And as I mentioned earlier, we also entered new accounts leading with security quite often. So it's good both ways. Growing at 40% is really great to see. That obviously gets harder as the numbers get larger, but we're excited about Bot Manager and the Cyberfend acquisition, as well as the new products that we're bringing to market in enterprise security. So that's an area where we'll be continuing to make investments in order to maintain strong growth rates. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities : And with this new introduction of those new product and acquisitions, are you making any changes to your go-to-market strategy, or what are the other investments you're planning to do? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: With the new enterprise products, we have an overlay team, but we expect with those products that our existing sales force can sell them. They're both easy to explain. And as I mentioned, easy to use and integrate and get going. And so I think our existing sales force is going to be able to sell those. And right now, we're helping them with an overlay. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company. Your question, please. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you. You mentioned, too, you're obviously going to be investing in the business, and for the year, we should see EBITDA margins in, I think, you said high 30s. And I think you also mentioned that the intention is to get back up to double-digit growth. So I guess my question is for the company to continue to grow at double-digit growth beyond 2017 into the next few years hopefully, do you think that you have to remain in the high 30s and therefore, that's the new long-term operating margin for the business \u2013 or EBITDA margin for the business? Or do you think this is more of a one-time investment through 2017, and then as we go into 2018 and beyond, we can potentially get back up to that 40% type EBITDA margin? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Colby. I mean, we'll cover it more at the upcoming Investor Summit, but I still think the long-term model for the company in the low 40s is the right one. I do think that what you're going to see in 2017, and I said for the foreseeable future, because I think you're going to hear in 2017, you're going to hear about new product adjacencies that we are going to enter. And I think what you're going to see is we're going to make investments in those areas. Those investments are probably going to extend beyond 2017. And so I think the interim model for the company, not the long-term model, I think, the interim model for the company is going to be the high 30s. But I do think that once those businesses get to a level of scale, because they'll be kind of early-stage businesses, I think once they get to scale, I think that we will be able to get the company model back to the low 40s EBITDA. But I think that even beyond 2017, we intend to operate the company in the high 30s. And I think that given the nature of the adjacent areas, I think that they have significant opportunities for EBITDA that's more like our Performance and Security EBITDA. But obviously, it's going to take a time for those businesses to ramp to be able to realize that, and I think what we want to do is we don't want to constrain investment. We want to make sure we're investing to capitalize on that because now is the opportunity. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Breen from William Blair. Your question, please. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Just want to clarify one thing, and then just follow up the question. On the CapEx you talked about significantly going up, but still within the 16% to 18% range? That's my understanding. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes, yes. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: That means we were 14% in 2016. We'll be back in the 16% to 18% range in 2017. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. And then just on new sales and where the revenue growth is coming from as you look across sort of Security, Performance and Media as three separate segments, is it adding new customers? Is it existing customers taking more services? And does that differ across those segments? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I would say that the more of the growth has been coming from selling more into our installed base. We've been able to take the offerings that we have and further penetrate them into the installed base. I think Tom's right that Security's been a product category that we've been able to penetrate with new customers, and then once you get in you can Land and Expand them. You can expand it via other offerings. But I'd say more of the growth to date has come from penetration into the installed base. And there's still a significant opportunity to do more there. I mentioned earlier that 38% of our customers buy security, so that means there's an opportunity for 62% of customers to actually buy one of our Security Solutions. And so I think you're going to see that we're going to further penetrate the offerings, and I think as we bring more innovation to the table, there's more of an opportunity to sell more into the installed base. And then I think you're going to see us do more in the way of new customer acquisition, Land and Expand model, and I think some of the new offerings are actually going to help us with that. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Power from Baird. Your question, please. Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Yeah. Just to maybe come back on the Security area. Tom, you referenced the strength in Bot Manager, that being one of the most successful newer products you've had in the last couple of years. And you've got a couple of the new Enterprise Security products, which I realized are early, but I'm wondering if you could just help us maybe frame how we should think about the market size opportunities for each of those, Bot Manager and Enterprise, perhaps relative to your DDoS market, and what you're doing in Security today? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I think they're very large. Now Bot Manager fits in with our Kona Site Defender and the Web security product space. And Bot Manager's market is at least as big as Kona, and we're seeing that in terms of the ARPUs with customers that are adopting that. EAA and ETP are on the Enterprise side, and that's a new market for us to go into. That's a market that's traditionally used devices that are purchased by the IT manager, operated in the private network. I think as we go to the future, you're going to see those capabilities sold as cloud services in a recurring revenue market, and we're bringing those kinds of products to market now to help that fundamental change in enterprise architecture and enterprise security. In the long run, I think the services for enterprise networking and security have a bigger TAM than Web delivery and security. Of course, it's just at the beginning, so it'll take a long time to catch up, but there's a lot more money spent in enterprise networking than there is in Content Delivery. And I think the term often you'll hear in the industry is enterprise networking is turning inside out, and I think you'll be seeing the adoption of cloud services replacing the purchase of devices operated by the IT manager and the WAM (52:07). Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your question, please. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Can I see if we could maybe put a finer point on the top six question? I know you said it would decline in 1Q, but is 1Q the point where it bottoms as a percentage of revenue? And is there any \u2013 especially the top four because those are the material ones, that might be up for renewal later in the year where there might be some risk to that bottoming out of those six as a percentage of revenue? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No. As we talked about, I think as a percentage of revenue we expect or certainly prefer to see a decline in percentage of revenue. First, you have the rest of the business, the core business over 90% growing at a very strong clip, and I think these six of which there's really three that are larger today quite possibly could decline in the revenue they pay us, which would mean their percentage would continue to decrease. And as we look to the future sort of that's the way we're thinking, of course, we're going to do everything we can to maximize revenue in those accounts. I think we provide them tremendous value and three of them are still sizable customers, and I think will always be sizable customers for Akamai. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And then as I said, any of the top four \u2013 I guess, the top three are that ones that you're focusing on, that would be a risk in the back half of the year as far as renewals? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I don't think there's so much of an issue there and the impact that any one of them can have is now much less than it used to be, so I don't think that's an issue really to be thinking about. I think the key is they're less than 10% today. We're anticipating further declines certainly as a percentage of revenues through the year and potentially in the future. But I don't think there's any giant event in a single quarter associated with any one customer. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I'm going to try and squeeze one more in, sorry, but I don't know if you guys want to, but any thoughts about trying to give us a sense for what depreciation should be for next year, so we end up getting not just EBITDA but below the line right as well? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Well, I think, again, I think you should look at our depreciation expense (54:31) as a percent of revenue to take the depreciation expense that we've been incurring as a percent of revenue. And as you ramp CapEx, as a percent of revenue you should be ramping depreciation as a percent of revenue in a similar way. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Your question, please. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. So just two clarifications. Tom, can you give us your best guess maybe on the top six of what's going on? Is it just one or two that are still kind of really seeing declining revenues and maybe a guess on where they can bottom out as a percentage of revenue? Is it 8% of revenue, 4% of revenue, just any more color around that would be great? And I had a quick follow-up. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. No, we're not giving guidance at that level of detail, (55:15) to say we expect some further declines not at the rate we've already seen, obviously, because now they're less than 10% of our total revenue. And this is associated with these companies spend billions of dollars a year in infrastructure generally, and they're doing more the delivery themselves. I think we still provide them significant value. And of course, I'd like to see the revenue there increase as we go forward, but we're not expecting to have that happen. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. And then on the OTT video side, can you maybe talk about why is it accelerating now? What's kind of come together? And a few of the offerings seem to be off to a rocky start in terms of quality, can you talk about it? Is that because of the CDN bottleneck, or is there some other bottlenecks? And maybe just lastly on the OTT front, how do you think your quality is kind of comparing to your competitors in the OTT front? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I'd say OTT is growing at a very solid pace. It hasn't exploded. At times people think that might happen, but that's not taken place. I think there's a lot of new offers out there \u2013 continue to be new offers. People are going to try lots of different kinds of things, and some will have more success than others in the marketplace. It is a very hard thing to do. Just even the delivery of the videos at high levels of quality is very hard, and that's where we really excel. And so we get a significant share of that market and as it grows, we should be in a position to benefit from it. And there's other things besides the delivery that are complicated technically, things involving ads, with ads supported OTT, very complicated to do, and there's a lot of players in the ecosystem in getting everything to work just right. There's problems sometimes. Again, this is where Akamai really helps their customers in being able to make sure that OTT, it is delivered reliably, can handle large-scale at high bit rates, which means high quality pictures and at a reasonable price point because as that industry grows they need to see the cost per bit delivered come down. And so that's a place where we've got great strength, and I'm very optimistic about the future growth of our OTT business. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut from Guggenheim Securities. Your question, please. Jonathan Schildkraut - Guggenheim Securities : Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions here. Listen, I'd like to maybe do a little bit of follow-on on to the large Internet Platform question. Even this quarter and last quarter, you've been \u2013 the revenue numbers have held a lot better than we were anticipating, and I'm wondering as we think about that customer group if it is still sort of overflow that you're receiving in terms of traffic, or if there's been any sort of change in terms of the workloads maybe that they're handing off to you versus the ones that they're keeping on their own do-it-yourself platform. Or maybe even alternatively, we've seen them push into some of the new product offerings that you guys are out there with. That incremental color would be helpful. Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. We don't really operate on an overflow basis. So it's whatever you're seeing is not really attributed to that. I don't think there's really been a fundamental change in the Internet platform companies in terms of their utilization quarter-to-quarter. Generally, the trend that we expect to see is they're going to try to do more of the delivery themselves. Obviously, they'll take the easier stuff and work on that first. That's one thing that we've seen in the past. That said this stuff is hard to do and to do well and actually to do affordably. So I think that we will continue to have business with these customers. I just think it'll be a lower percentage of revenue going forward. Jonathan Schildkraut - Guggenheim Securities : All right. Understood. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. So in terms of the increased investment that you're planning on making, I want to understand, I know you don't give guidance beyond the March quarter, but just philosophically, is it a front-end loaded investment in the year where there's more hiring upfront and maybe the non-head count investment happens in the back half? Just how do you layer it in? So do we just step down to the high 30s and then it's a stable EBITDA? Or is there going to be a gradual move down to a trough and then an improvement off the bottom? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No. I think you're going to see a steady increase in investment throughout the year. I think you're going to see that investment occur, it's going to begin in the first quarter. You won't see it manifest itself significantly because it's going to take a while to get the head count on board and the spending to ramp. So I think you're probably going to begin to see that effective in Q2. And then my expectation is that, again, it'll stay in the high 30s thereafter. So I think you'll probably \u2013 I'm not going to specifically guide for Q2, but as I said beyond the first quarter, which I said 39% to 40%, and I think that it will be 39% to 40% depending upon where our revenue lands in the range. But I do expect that kind of in Q2 and beyond that it's going to operate in the high 30s. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then my follow-up question is I think you gave us a comment on the top six customers and what you expect in terms of the further decline in the March quarter. I want to make sure I heard you correctly. Does that leave the rest of the customers actually need to accelerate in terms of growth? And if that's the case, where's the source of that acceleration going to come from? Is it the Security side or the Performance or Media side and why? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Well, part of that is, again, when you talk about acceleration, you're talking about year-on-year. So as Tom mentioned, the declines we've seen in these large customers were much more significant in 2016. So the wraparound impact of that really began a little bit in Q4 and you're going to see that continue in Q1. And so some of it is the wraparound effect of these customers not having nearly the impact on the company growth rates as they did a year ago. My comment was more of a sequential comment that Q4 to Q1 we always see some seasonal declines in the company revenues and also with these big customers, and I expect to see that happen. And as I mentioned, I think some of the seasonal decline is going to be much more notable in the Media business, and I think you're going to see steady growth in the Performance and Security business. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So basically at the midpoint of the range outside the top six you're expecting the same performance in March as you just saw in December? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, roughly, yes. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Isbell (01:02:22) from Pacific Crest Securities. Your question, please. Unknown Speaker : Hey, guys. Tom, just a quick question. Hey, can you guys talk a little bit about your relationship with Microsoft? And if you're seeing any sort of adoption from public cloud users purchasing your product on their platform? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. You can click to buy Akamai Whole Site Delivery on Azure. A lot of companies have done that. It's not a material amount of revenue to us. The Microsoft relationship, on the other hand, is very important to us. We have a substantial number of customers and revenue that flow through Microsoft. And of course, they're a large customer themselves. Unknown Speaker : Great. And then it sounds like you guys are seeing a little bit more success maybe on the outbound sales side, particularly with Security. What do you need to do to sort of turn that equation around to get more of a pull in effect? I know you guys are stepping up your sales force to go after that growth, but if you could talk a little bit about that, that would be great. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, we have a new CMO, Monique Bonner, and really making substantial progress in our digital marketing effort, and I think that'll help quite a bit in terms of generating more efficient inbound sales. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Your question, please. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, good afternoon. Just to clarify, when you talked about getting back to double-digit revenue, were you suggesting that happens in 2017 or beyond 2017, or you weren't saying any timeframe at all? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I wasn't referring to a specific timeframe. I think you know the company has been operating in double-digit revenue growth. This is actually the first year we have not. I think you know that certainly the driver of that has been what's been going on with these large Internet Platform Customers. The company growth rate outside of them has been growing in the mid-teens. So we have been growing in the double-digits. I think that my point was that as we make these investments, these investments are going to take a bit of time to see revenue ramp, and so you're going to see the dividends from these investments more in 2018 and 2019. And I think that is what's going to lead to consistent double-digit growth for the company. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Thanks. And then for international, it's been growing, but it still remains around 30% of revenue. Is part of the investment in 2017 focused at all on initiatives that maybe over-indexed internationally? It seems like that could be a huge opportunity. Is product set or getting the right sales team in place the key factors to drive international to a higher percent of revenue? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: We're pretty pleased with our international growth, but you're right that our international growth has been growing very fast and growing very fast particularly in our Asia-Pacific region. So our investments are much more weighted, I would say, on R&D innovation, to be frank. Our investments are not heavily weighted towards more go-to-market. I actually think the go-to-market side of the equation \u2013 we will make some investments there. It's a matter of giving our existing sales force more products to sell. Our sales force is pretty confident that penetrating our products into their installed base set of customers is a matter of giving them more products to sell, and I think that by stepping up investment in R&D, getting more products announced, I think will lead to kind of more revenue. And we've proven we can do that, Security being the most recent example. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Jonathan, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee from Craig-Hallum. Your question, please. Unknown Speaker : Yeah, hey. Good evening, guys. This is Ryan (01:06:13) sitting in for Jeff. Just for Ion, I know at the last Analyst Day you mentioned 53% penetration with the product in your customer base. Any update you can provide on base penetration? Or where you see the penetration peeking out? And the price uplift you're seeing from that? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think in general that we continue to get good traction in upgrading Ion to our customers that buy our Web performance products that you can imagine that it's kind of a hierarchy of \u2013 it starts with customers that really, really care about performance. And so I think we have a further room there, but I think that kind of the customers that are going to buy Ion \u2013 many of them are already buying their products. While there's more to sell there, I'd say that probably not a significant, significant opportunity there. And, yeah, we have seen when customers upgrade to Ion that there is an ARPU uplift at times, but I also think there's other things to sell for our Web Performance Solutions. As Tom mentioned, Image Manager is another offering to sell into the installed base. So if they're buying Ion, now they can buy Image Manager. If they're DSA, now they can buy Imagine Manager. And I think you're going to see us have other adjacencies like that within Web Performance as well. Unknown Speaker : Great. Thanks. And then back to the top six customers of platform customers, is there any change you guys are seeing in terms of your share of the traffic that you're delivering relative to what the platform company may be doing themselves for using a multi-CDN strategy for? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: With the top six, we have obviously lost share to the do-it-yourself effort. We're not seeing lost share to other third-party CDNs. It's an issue with the DIY, which is the big company has their own platform and they want to try and do more of it themselves. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thanks. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, everyone, and we appreciate you joining us for today. And in closing, as Jim mentioned, in addition to our 2017 Investor Summit on March 14, we will be presenting at a number of investor conferences in February and March and details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Thank you all for joining us, and have a wonderful evening. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Akamai Technologies Q1 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you very much, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 2, 2017. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. Also please note that all growth rates references will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai performed well in the first quarter with solid growth on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue in Q1 was $609 million, up 8% year-over-year; our strongest year-over-year growth rate in several quarters. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.69 per diluted share, up 5% year-over-year. Our strong results were driven by our Performance and Security Solutions with revenue growth of 18% over Q1 of 2016. These solutions accounted for over 60% of our overall revenue in Q1 and they contributed very attractive margins. As we discussed at our recent Investor Summit, the EBITDA margin profile for our Performance and Security Solutions has been about 50%. And this figure includes the substantial investments we made last year to innovate and bring compelling new products to market. For example, Ion 3.0, which we launched last month, dramatically improves the mobile experience for end users. For a customer like ZALORA, an Asian fashion retailer, mobile performance is critical because a significant amount of their business comes from mobile users. With Ion 3.0, ZALORA performance was 225% faster over cellular and 250% faster over Wi-Fi. That has translated into higher sales for them and a better experience for their customers. Through our recent acquisition of SOASTA, Ion is now complemented with two exciting new products : mPulse and CloudTest. These innovative solutions will provide our customers with the ability to measure, validate, and improve the business impact of their websites and applications. For example, Lowe's use the full suite of SOASTA capabilities to correlate site performance with sales and then drive e-commerce sales to over $1 billion through increased traffic and conversion rates. On the security front, scale has become critical as typical attacks now contain tens or hundreds of gigabits per second of malicious traffic, more than enough to overwhelm the traditional defenses of even the most well-equipped data centers. To address this expanding threat, we launched Kona Site Defender 5.0 and Web Application Protector in Q1. The new version of Kona Site Defender includes protection for API end points to help secure websites, mobile infrastructure and other API-driven requests. Web Application Protector is designed for the mid-market, providing customers with low touch and virtually maintenance-free protection from the most common DDoS and Web application attacks. We also launched Bot Manager 2.0 earlier this quarter. The new version of Bot Manager features enhanced bot detection and mitigation, along with advanced policy enforcement capabilities. This summer, we expect to further enhance Bot Manager to include innovative machine learning capabilities to better stop account takeover attacks. This technology was obtained in part through our recent acquisition of Cyberfend. We're also planning to bring new enterprise security and networking products to market this year. Our vision for these products is to secure, optimize and accelerate the enterprise network as a service in the cloud. We're doing this by utilizing the power of the Akamai platform to support new services that are simple to understand and easy-to-use, allow customers to try before they buy, allow for a land and expand sales motion, and to create synergies with the rest of our product portfolio. For example, at our recent Investor Summit, we demonstrated our new service for securing access to enterprise applications. Enterprise Application Access, or EAA, leverages software obtained through our recent acquisition of Soha Systems. It addresses the growing need for businesses to more easily and securely manage application access for a growing mix of users with different risk profiles without poking holes in the enterprise firewall. EAA is easy to deploy and simple to manage. Customers can implement it in minutes and then take advantage of Akamai's other performance and security solutions for all their internal applications. At the Investor Summit, we also demonstrated another exciting new offering called Enterprise Threat Protector or ETP. ETP is designed to protect enterprise employees and infrastructure against phishing, malware and data exfiltration attacks by providing a cloud-based recursive DNS service to block access to malware sites and data exfiltration botnets. It's currently in beta with 17 customers, all of whom are able to self integrate and use the product to block malware that evaded their other security systems. ETP is expected to launch this summer. Branch Accelerator is also now in beta. For users in the branch, their enterprise connectivity to the Internet may not be sufficient to support video or downloads without impinging on their ability to do other kinds of work. Branch Accelerator puts Akamai's software in or near the branch office to provide caching, enforce quality of service and ensure protocol optimization, all with the goal of improving branch performance. Our enterprise business is just getting started, and I expect significant growth ahead as we ramp up and launch these new products. Next, I'd like to talk about our Media business. As we discussed in our analyst calls over the last year, our Media business continues to be heavily impacted by the do-it-yourself efforts of six of the largest Internet platform companies. Our Q1 revenue from these companies was $51 million, a 29% decrease over Q1 of 2016. Traffic from our other media customers has continued to grow at a rapid rate, but at a slower pace than we've seen historically. As we discussed in the past, media traffic growth rates are highly variable over time and depend on a variety of factors. Pricing in the media sector remains aggressive, but the rate and pace of price declines continue to be in line with historical trends. The net effect of all these factors is that as we look forward to the rest of 2017, we believe that the revenue growth rate for our Media business will continue to be below the growth rates we've historically seen and that the growth rate for Akamai's overall revenues and margins will continue to be impacted as a result. That said, I want to be very clear that I believe Media is a good business for Akamai and that it has a very bright future. Over the longer term, I believe that the impact of the large platform companies on our Media business will lessen and that the business overall will return to historical levels of performance. One of the reasons for my optimism is our OTT business. A recent study predicts that over-the-top viewing will exceed traditional broadcast viewing within five years. Even if this prediction is only approximately correct, there is the potential for a very large amount of video traffic to move online and Akamai is very well-positioned to benefit as a result. At last week's National Association of Broadcasters, or NAB convention in Las Vegas, I met with executives from several of the world's leading media companies, and they were all talking about the growing demand for OTT content and how Akamai solutions can and do meet their needs. At NAB, we demonstrated two new products that dramatically improve the OTT experience for viewers : Media Services Live and Media Acceleration. Media Services Live was recognized with two awards in the convention. Streaming Media named it as one of six Best of NAB winners. And TV Technology presented Media Services Live with a Best of Show award. Media Services Live features breakthrough technology designed to eliminate the large latencies that are typical with Internet streaming, resulting in a viewer experience that is comparable to or better than traditional broadcast TV. We recently used this new solution to deliver nearly 100 million live video streams for a major sporting event with a 100% ingestion success rate and greater than 99.99% availability for viewers. In addition, we recently launched our new Media Acceleration capability to more efficiently communicate between end-user devices and the Akamai network, thereby providing a much higher-quality video experience for viewers. When Media Acceleration was used for a recent major sporting event, we achieved 72% fewer video start errors, 24% less rebuffering, 23% more HD viewers and 25% more 4K viewers. Better quality video, like HD and 4K, requires higher and more consistent throughput to end-users, which is an area where Akamai excels. Across the world, media companies have come to appreciate that it is very difficult to replicate our ability to deliver online video with broadcast-level quality, scale and security. It's also our belief that Akamai is leading the competition in inventing what's next while improving on what's now. That's always been our heritage. So while today's viewers are consuming live streams over IP, we're anticipating what's coming next : virtual and augmented reality delivered seamlessly anywhere in the world over wired and wireless networks with virtually zero latency. That's the future of the digital media experience, and Akamai is already working hard to enable it. In summary, I'm pleased with our Q1 results and I'm even more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as enormous volumes of video move online, billions of devices get connected, cyber attacks explode in size and sophistication, and enterprise networks undergo a massive change as they turn inside out. I believe that Akamai is uniquely positioned to solve the challenge faced by companies across the world as they try to cope with these major technology shifts. Personally, I'm as excited as ever to be at Akamai. I remain confident in Akamai's future, and even though I'm already a large holder of Akamai shares, I'm happy to announce today that I'll be continuing my personal stock buyback program through a 10b5-1 plan that will purchase $1 million of Akamai stock every month for the rest of 2017. Now let me turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed look at the quarter and then we'll answer your questions. Jim? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom highlighted, Q1 was another solid quarter for Akamai with both revenue and earnings coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Revenue in the first quarter was $609 million, up 7% year-over-year or up 8% in constant currency, and up 13% if you exclude our six large Internet platform customers. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was particularly strong, coming in at $369 million, growing 18% year-over-year and was the driver of delivering to the high end of our guidance in the quarter. Performance and Security Solutions contributed over 60% of our total revenue in Q1. We are very pleased with the continued revenue diversification into our highly differentiated, higher margin and more stable subscription model offerings. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines with particularly strong growth continuing in our Cloud Security Solutions. First quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $110 million, up 37% year-over-year. Our Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of $450 million. We are pleased with the continued strong growth and execution of our Cloud Security business, led by our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic offerings and our continued portfolio expansion into new areas, like bot management and Enterprise Application Access. And we plan to further broaden our performance, security and enterprise offerings where we see substantial long-term growth potential. And our recent SOASTA acquisition, which closed in early April, is a good example of extending our market-leading Web acceleration offerings into the natural adjacency of Digital Performance Management focusing on cloud application monitoring and testing and aligning performance to business value. Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $187 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and up 3%, excluding our large Internet platform customers. This revenue growth rate was lower than the past several quarters and below our expectations, driven by a moderation of traffic growth throughout the quarter in our Americas region and within our gaming vertical, most notably. It is important to note that while the pricing environment in the Media business remains highly competitive, aggregate price per bit declines remain roughly within historical norms. As we've discussed in the past, the drivers of the Media business, namely traffic volumes and price, can lead to revenue variability from period to period given the timing of customer renewals at lower price points; the size, timing and delivery mechanism of software and gaming releases; as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities. And while Media growth rates have moderated more than we expected in the near term, we continue to remain bullish on the longer-term secular growth trends for our Media business, particularly in the OTT area, as more video content moves online. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $53 million in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year. Turning now to our Q1 revenue results by customer division, revenue from our Web Division customers was $305 million, up 15% year-over-year. We continued to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with Cloud Security offerings. Revenue from our Media Division customers was $285 million in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year and up 11%, excluding the impact of the large Internet platform customers. This growth rate was lower than 2016 levels driven by the moderation in media traffic that I mentioned earlier. Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $19 million in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year. Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 33% of total revenue in Q1, up two points from Q4 levels. International market revenue was $203 million in the first quarter, up 19% year-over-year or up 21% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia Pacific region. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a year-over-year basis and $2 million on a sequential basis. Revenue from our U.S. market was $407 million, up 2% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers who are based in the U.S. continued to weigh heavily on the U.S. market growth rates. Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q4 levels and the same period last year. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 66%, down 1 point from Q4 levels and consistent with the same period last year. GAAP operating expenses were $288 million in the quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $228 million, down seasonally from Q4 levels, but above our guidance range, driven by higher commissions and performance incentives as well as increased recruiting-related spend associated with an uptick in hiring activity. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $241 million, down $6 million from Q4 levels, due to seasonal revenue declines, and up $7 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 39%, down one point from Q4 levels and down two points from Q1 last year and within our guidance range. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $87 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $75 million, up slightly from Q4 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $165 million, down $9 million from Q4 levels from the seasonal revenue declines and up $1 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, down one point from Q4 levels and down two points from the same period last year and within our guidance range. Moving on to other income and expense items, interest income for the first quarter was $5 million, up slightly from Q4 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the first quarter was $81 million or $0.46 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $120 million or $0.69 of earnings per diluted share and at the high end of our guidance, driven by the strong revenue achievement. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $34 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 175 million shares, unchanged from Q4 levels and down 2 million shares from Q1 of last year. Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 58 days, up four days from Q4 levels and down two days from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $94 million and at the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow generation continued to be solid with cash from operations of $143 million in the first quarter. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is just under $900 million. During the quarter, we spent $72 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.1 million shares. As we discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us with the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times, including the repurchase program. Over the past five years, we have lowered the company's share count by over 7 million shares or 4% while also spending nearly $1 billion in strategic acquisitions, thereby deploying capital in areas that we believe are in the best long-term interests of the company and our shareholders. In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q1 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company. Before we look ahead to Q2, I wanted to spend just a minute on our recent Investor Summit. For those of you that joined us in person or via the webcast, the themes we shared this year were the same as in prior years. There has been a level of consistency in what we've talked about every year, the favorable market trends, the uniqueness in differentiation of the Akamai platform, the leadership position we maintain and the very rapidly changing and evolving cloud ecosystem and a tremendous amount of innovation we've seen across the business and new product adjacencies as well as continued enhancements within our existing core offerings. Innovation is alive and well across all the divisions, and we believe it will be a key enabler for accelerating growth back to double-digits for the company. The fundamentals of our business remain strong. We're continuing to innovate rapidly. And while our investments in new adjacencies will pressure margins in the near term, we believe they will drive significant future top-line and bottom-line growth. As I said at the Investor Summit, we are committed to balancing both top-line and bottom-line over the long term. And I certainly believe that if we continue to execute, we will remain a compelling investment proposition for investors. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect Media growth rates to continue to moderate from Q1 levels and within Americas gaming vertical, most notably. While it is also possible that Media growth rates moderate in the back half of 2017 as well, we remain bullish in the medium- to long-term growth prospects for this business, especially the potential for an increase in the amount of video traffic that could move online. Factoring in the anticipated moderation of Media growth, we are expecting overall Q2 revenue in the range of $597 million to $609 million. At the high end of this range, year-over-year growth would be 8% in constant currency, consistent with Q1 levels and up 2 points from Q2 2016 levels. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on revenue of $6 million compared to Q2 of last year and a positive impact of $3 million sequentially. At these revenue ranges, we expect GAAP gross margins of 65% and cash gross margins of 76%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $235 million to $241 million, up roughly $10 million sequentially at the midpoint. This increase is driven partly by our continued investment in new product innovation, service delivery enablement and platform scaling and partly from absorbing our recent SOASTA acquisition. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate EBITDA margins of roughly 37%. And while we are not providing specific guidance beyond Q2 during this call, we want to be transparent about our plans to continue to make investments in the business throughout 2017 in the areas outlined earlier even while the Media business experiences a near-term moderation in revenue growth. We believe these are important investments that will enable us to drive accelerated, sustainable, long-term double-digit top and bottom line growth. We are confident we can manage the company within our 37% to 39% EBITDA model, while we may go through some quarters where EBITDA margins fall slightly below these levels, possibly even in the second half of 2017. As I've said in the past, our ability to maintain EBITDA margins within our stated ranges is heavily dependent on revenue volumes, possible M&A and needed investments in the business. Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $77 million to $79 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 24% for Q2. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.61. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $42 million to $44 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 174 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend $110 million to $115 million, excluding equity compensation in the second quarter. This is an uptick from Q1 levels, primarily due to some planned facility and IT upgrades as well as continued expansion of our Secure Delivery Network and Prolexic scrubbing capacity. In summary, I am very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Akamai and our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. Our first question is from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I think the first question that really jumps to mind is the Investor Summit wasn't that long ago and it really feels like there's a change in tone around the Media business. When did that become apparent? Was it apparent earlier in the quarter and you just wanted to focus on the high level of the investment summit (sic) [Investor Summit] (28:54) or is this something that you were expecting better volumes at the end of the quarter type of thing? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, let me start with, we are very bullish on the Media business. So that has not changed. Nothing has changed about what we believe are the growth prospects for the Media business. Relative to our Investor Summit is that what we did see is that we did see traffic growth moderate, as I mentioned in the Americas region in particular and very notably in our gaming vertical and it moderated throughout the quarter. So it was relatively strong in January and then it moderated in February and then it moderated further in March. And that was really the driver of kind of, I would say, missing our internal expectations. But I'd say we are very, very optimistic about the Media business long-term. And as we said to you guys before, the nature of the Media business is it does go through periods where traffic spikes, traffic softens at times. But over the long-term, we think this is a very good business and it will be a very good grower for the company. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then maybe one follow-up question. Can you help us parse maybe the data this way? You give us the geographic and we see the North America weakness in the comments that you made. But if you were to split the platform, the big six out from that, what did North American growth look like, just so we can kind of go to the non-big six in North America to understand what's happening there. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes. Well, you got to be careful because the Americas also includes our Media customers as well as our Web customers. I think Americas' growth, if you exclude the large Internet platform customers, was roughly 10%. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from James Breen of William Blair. Your line is open. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Just a couple questions. One, the guidance for next quarter. As you look at that number, approximately SOASTA closed in the beginning of the quarter and I think you had said to be about $20 million of revenues. Is that included in that guidance number just comparing that relative to where consensus is? And then on the big six, you obviously saw pretty good absolute step down in the first quarter from the fourth quarter and the third quarter last year. Is there anything in there that's seasonal in that? And then as you see think about your largest customers now, how big are your top two or three customers as a percentage of revenue? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: So I think the large Internet platform customers for the most part came in line with what we expected in Q1. They do seasonally drop Q4 to Q1. That Q4 seasonally is a large quarter for all \u2013 actually, all of our large media customers in particular. So the step down there was not unexpected, pretty much in line with what we thought. Those customers now represent about 8% of our revenues. So the good news is that as we go through this, the diversification of the company's revenue, as I mentioned in the Investor Summit, we are much better diversified from a customer perspective; we're much better diversified from a product category perspective; and we're much better diversified from a geography perspective. So I think the health and diversification of the company's revenue is much better now than it has been. And I think relative to the giants and maybe what we expect them to do kind of longer-term, I think as we've said before, we do expect a further deceleration with two of those six. And we expect them to further kind of decline as they serve more of their traffic themselves. So nothing there has really changed and what we've seen here is very much in line with our expectations. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: And then just on the guidance side, so that guidance will include some portion of the SOASTA revenue since the deal closed in April? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes. Yeah. As I said, we're not going to guide specifically on SOASTA's revenues and margins. I said at the Investor Summit that SOASTA probably will generate, call it, roughly $20 million for the remainder of 2017. It could be a little bit less than that. But what you're going to have in the first quarter with SOASTA is, as you know, with purchase accounting, we're going to take a very large deferred revenue haircut. So the revenue in the second quarter will certainly be less than and it will be in the third and the fourth quarter. So it's not that material. We're going to embed that in our Web performance business and we're going to report that within our Performance and Security category. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: And just, finally, just as you look across the division, it seems as though performance and security continue to perform well. So really the weakness we're seeing is mainly in the media side. Around that gaming vertical, is it multiple players? Is it one or two players that you're seeing having the most pressure? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: There's a lot of competition in media and I would say especially when it comes to software downloads, which is where the revenue comes from the gaming vertical. And as the traffic shifts more towards updates that can be done in the background as opposed to a new game where you're sitting there waiting for it in real time, well, that means performance matters less, means pricing is lower, and competition is even stiffer. And we've talked about that before. And I think that's part of what we're seeing here. But there's lots of competition in media, particularly for software downloads and especially if it's in a background kind of mode. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes. And, Jim, your comment about Performance and Security, it continues to be a very strong growth for the company. The 18% growth in Q1, last year it consistently grew kind of in the high-teens. So what you see here really is just a little softening in media growth kind of in our Americas region and in the area that we mentioned. Again, this tends to be the nature of the Media business. And I think we've gone through these spells before where media surges and you start to see media accelerate. So it's not uncommon to go through these periods. But I believe we're optimistic about the long-term growth potential, not just for OTT, but also within gaming. That as gaming becomes more and more latency sensitive and performance sensitive, as you see more and more things like AR and VR that, I think, that all of a sudden, the differentiation for Akamai becomes more and more apparent. So we're bullish about the prospects for media. I think we're going to go through some near-term slowing in media, but optimistic about the long-term for media. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Will Power of Baird. Your line is open. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: We'll move to the next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great, guys. Could you give us maybe some color on your Media business percentage where you think you have kind of fairly differentiated services that are not as commodity like we're seeing on software here? And Jim, maybe just give maybe a little more clarity what you're seeing on the guidance on the Media side, how much it'd be down sequentially? Maybe I kind of missed that. But it seems like I'm having a tough time getting to that type of overall revenue guidance that you're providing for the second quarter. Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I'm not sure what else to tell you about the guidance. We don't guide necessarily by product category that our media products were about 3% growth kind of excluding the large Internet platform customers. And our Media Division customer growth was about 10%. So we expect that to further moderate to the areas that I mentioned, which is in the Americas and notably within gaming. We do expect to have continued strong growth in Performance and Security, continue to expect to have good growth within Services. So I think what you're going to see here in the guide is you kind to do it at the midpoint. At the midpoint, you're going to see a further moderation of media growth rates and that's really kind of what it's all about. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And on Media, can you maybe give us some color on what do you think is more commoditized versus where you have more for a differentiated product? I mean, I think some of your OTT video was fairly unique in terms of quality and scale. Where you're at, at this point, in the business? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. No, I think you characterized it well. At one end of the spectrum, you've got background software downloads, which is not performance sensitive, and that's the best opportunity for competition. Obviously, pricing lower there as well. The other end of the spectrum, you've got live and linear OTT where performance is very sensitive, and it's very challenging to deliver high quality at scale. And you see the great work that we're doing there with the kinds of awards we win at NAB. We're the go-to player for the major events that you watch online and traffic growing well there. And I think really key for us is to see OTT adoption continue, even better if it accelerates, quality levels to improve as broadcasters move more content into the higher-quality formats, HD and someday, 4K. Those are all very good areas for Akamai. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Just switching to Security business. Security this time grew around 35.5% year-over-year. That's a deceleration from last year of 47% and even Q4 of 41%. I'm wondering, for the remaining of the year, I know you don't guide, but are you expecting any kind of new product that's coming in contributing, because if I look at your 2015 to 2016, it decelerated from 49% to 44%. But as you look 2017, what's your expectation in terms of trends and contribution from the newer products? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Well, let me start and then I can have \u2013 Tom can talk a little about the products. I think you're right that the growth rates in Security were in the kind of the high-40%s and then the low-40%s and now they're in the high 30%s. This is a business that is now a annualized run rate of $450 million. Five years ago this was just a idea. So this business is growing very, very rapidly. Its growth rate on a percentage basis is lower because it's on a much, much bigger base. So we're very, very positive about the Security business and our execution in the Security business. And you've got to remember, this is all subscription model offerings. This is not license model. This is literally a subscription model business that now is approaching $0.5 billion. So Tom can talk a little bit about the product categories, but there's a lot going on there. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes. I talked about in the prepared remarks that we have the new version of Kona out now, and that includes now protection for API end points. And the way to think about that is for your mobile apps where as you have more mobile apps deployed, the attackers are now going after those and we have a really unique capability to very nicely defend against those. You have the new version of Bot Manager, and that manages the response given to the automated entities that are coming to your websites and apps. There's a wide variety of those. I guess, price scrapers and account takeover attacks being maybe the worst there. And as I talked about with our new machine learning capabilities to be deployed this summer and then the next version of Bot Manager, we're very excited about that because that'll provide even better capabilities to stop the people trying \u2013 checking stolen IDs, and there's a ton of stolen IDs out there today. Then on the enterprise side, we're really just getting started in the market. There's two security products there. We're in the market selling Enterprise Application Access today. That was released in Q4. And we're in beta now with Enterprise Threat Protector, and that will become more generally available this summer. So there's a lot of new activity and products and innovation on the security side of the house and I'm very optimistic for continued very strong growth rates in our Security business. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on that last question regarding the Security business. I'm just curious, do you feel that your security products in aggregate are growing at market rates or potentially above? And to that point, what's the ability to sustain that? It looks like \u2013 well, it shouldn't look like. When I look at the new product that are coming out, I'm just curious, are those \u2013 in the security segment \u2013 are those anticipated to sustain the glide path, if you will, in terms of deceleration in growth that we're seeing? Or is there risk of a more prominent step down? And I guess, the reason I'm asking this is that with the Media business being weak or weaker than anticipated, obviously, the Security business has really been what's supported that. And it's difficult I think for all of us to really explicitly quantify exactly what that growth deceleration is going to look like. I think any color that could help us in that regard would be helpful. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Let me start with that. It depends on who you want to compare to, but I think for most all choices our growth rate in our security solutions is very strong compared to the competition. The traditional competition there is we have box providers and that just doesn't cut it anymore when you have the scale of attacks being so large that you can easily overwhelm the data center defenses. In fact, you can't afford to buy enough boxes to defend yourself against the large-scale attacks. In addition, we're now, as we talked about, just getting into the area of enterprise security. And just so I'm clear about that, almost all of our revenue today comes from what I would call web security or application security, and that's defending websites and defending web apps against things like DDoS attacks or site takeover attacks, that kind of thing. With our new enterprise line, we're now going to be defending enterprise users and the enterprise network against attacks like phishing attacks, malware attacks, attacks where maybe some device has been infected in the enterprise. The bad guys have gathered up all the internal data and now they're going to exfiltrate it. And we're going to be stopping those kinds of attacks. So really it sounds like security still and it is, but it's by our different capabilities and in the long run, a much larger market for us. So I do think that we have every opportunity to maintain a very strong growth rate in our Security business as it gets larger. We don't provide forward-looking guidance. We will keep you advised on how the new enterprise line is doing once it gets some critical mass. But I'm very optimistic about the future, very strong growth of our security products. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: I guess, maybe just one other question. You made three acquisitions in the second half of 2017 : Concord, Cyberfend, and Soha. I think you mentioned that ex FX and ex the top six customers, growth was 13% year-over-year. Can you give us like what's the organic growth? Is it fair to assume maybe 1% or 2% of that was a result of those acquisitions? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No, because Concord was just a handful of people with technology we really like, a very small acquisition. Cyberfend has not yet been integrated. As I talked about, we'll be releasing capabilities with the next version of Bot Manager this summer with Cyberfend technology. And Soha, we're just getting started their (46:23) sales. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Colby, there was really no revenue for any of those. Those were more technology tuck-ins. There's certainly some revenue that comes with SOASTA, as I mentioned, but the first three that you mentioned really were more of technology capability acquisitions. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, hi, Tom, Jim. I have a question on your overseas business and also back here in the States. The strength you're seeing overseas is a bit counterintuitive. I mean several equipment suppliers we track have noted weak demand trends especially in Europe. So is emerging markets primarily driving the strength you're seeing overseas? And then back here in the States, any of your big media customers kind of indicating to you they've increased their OTT programming volumes through the Akamai network heading into the back half or into next year? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes. No, you're absolutely right about the international growth, that the growth rates are very different in the European markets than the Asia Pacific markets. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're seeing very, very strong growth in the Asia Pacific markets. We are not seeing nearly the same level of growth in the European markets, but we have pretty good growth rates also in Europe. They're not the same as in Asia Pacific, but I'd say international growth rates at 21%, heavily fueled by Asia Pacific with decent growth in EMEA. And that's probably not uncommon. We certainly have more opportunity in our Asia Pacific markets where we're not nearly penetrated. And you could take the OTT question. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes. I think when you talk to the leading executives, I think they are more bought in than ever that a lot of the video content is going to move over the top. And I think the approach they're taking now is to try lots of different vehicles. A typical broadcaster might have their own OTT offer for their content and they might participate in several aggregated packages. And I think at this point, they don't really know which ones will be the most successful. So I think they're trying a variety of alternatives with the idea being that one way or another, a lot of the content is going to move online. And they don't want to get caught short making the wrong bet, so they're trying lots of the alternatives. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Kelleher of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Want to get back to the media side. Is there a steady-state level of revenue for Internet platform customers? Or does that go right to zero? Does that $51 million level out somewhere? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I mean, I think at the end of the day, it's tough to tell what's going to happen with the Internet platform customers that we certainly know that two of them have an intention to serve more of the traffic themselves. So as we said over the last couple quarters, we expect those two customers to continue to serve more traffic themselves which means less traffic will be served by Akamai. I think it's more difficult to call some of the other large Internet platform companies. Many of them have a culture of wanting to do more themselves. They do a lot with us today. I think it's really a matter of the use case and the capabilities that we possess. And if the capabilities we possess match the use case that they have and they don't have that capability, then we will continue to grow with them. So the reason we ring-fence them for you is because I think that investors have their own views of what's going to happen with those large companies. And I think it's difficult to call. I think that what we've tried to kind of provide some guidance on for you is that our expectation is they will continue to decline kind of over time here. So I don't know if they're going to go to zero, but I'm not sure we're ready to call that yet. But we expect that they're certainly going to continue to go down. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: And as a follow-up to that, if your other media customers are a little \u2013 the gaming sector are little slower, where do you stand with capacity utilization? And can you pull back on CapEx because you've got less media revenue to support? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: To be clear, media traffic is growing at a substantial rate. So we are continuing to build out. And of course, OTT traffic is growing at a substantial rate. So it's not a situation of underutilization. It's just that the growth rates, as a percentage, are less than they were before, of course, led by the largest platform companies. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: So you're not adjusting your CapEx for short-term weakness? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No, I think we always plan our CapEx in alignment with where we believe traffic growth is going to be. And I think, as Tom said, traffic is still growing very rapidly; it's just not growing as rapid a pace as we had projected. So, yes, we will dial CapEx in alignment with our revised projections, but we need to continue to build out as traffic grows and we don't have CapEx just for our Media business that while our Media business is certainly the most CapEx intensive that we do build our CapEx, as I mentioned, with our rapidly growing Security business, we're building out more attack capacity for Prolexic. And so there is a level of investment that's going on in CapEx. Even though security is not heavily CapEx-oriented business, it does have some CapEx. The other thing is, as we continue to make investments in R&D, we're going to capitalize more R&D, which is basically new product incubation. So there's a bunch of areas of CapEx many of which will continue to grow. Our expectation is that we'll manage CapEx and align it with traffic and revenue projections. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good evening. I have two questions. So first is on a comment about EBITDA margins possibly dipping down in the second half below 37%. Is that just a function of lower topline? Or is it higher expenses? And then the second question is, given the what sounds like a worse at least medium-term market on the gaming side, do you feel like you're still in a position to get Media back to double-digits and the company back to double-digit overall by 2018? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I'll take those and then Tom may, if he has anything else to offer. So we're not guiding necessarily, Michael, for the back half. I did signal that because I think you know that EBITDA is a function of a lot of things, revenue and volumes being the most notable. And as I mentioned that there are important investments that we believe we need to make that are in the best interest of the company and our shareholders long-term, which are investments in some of the enterprise areas, some of the security areas, some of the areas that we mentioned that are going to be very significant we believe top line and bottom line growers. And so we don't want to curtail investment there. And so my caution for the back half was more that we're going to continue to make investments, and should you continue to see a top line moderation in Media, and again we don't know whether that's going to be the case. I think we're really talking about Media in particular. I was just being cautious that if we do dip below 37%, I wanted to make sure that people realize our intention is to manage the company to 37% to 39% EBITDA. There may be a quarter or two where you go through something lower than that, but we'll manage it back accordingly. And I forgot what your second question was? Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Double-digit growth? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So we certainly have the expectation that we're going to return to double-digit growth in 2018. That's still where we believe we can be. You're right with the moderation in media that I don't believe this moderation in media is going to be a long-term phenomenon. So we may be going through a spell here for the next couple quarters where media growth softens. But, as you know, we've been through these periods before and then media growth roars again. So I think there's enough opportunity in media that we can get media growing again and get the company back to double digits. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Hart of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. There have been a bunch of questions about the Media Division, but I'd like to throw in just one more. This quarter we saw the media customer revenue growth outperform the Media Delivery product growth for orders of that trend (55:46). And wondering does that mean that your customers are buying Performance and Security offerings more than buying traditional Media Delivery offerings. And if that is the case, can you provide some more color on what solutions those customers are purchasing Performance and Security products for? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I would say that the media customers are certainly buying Performance products, especially Security. But they would not be buying more of that than the media products. The large majority of the Media Division revenue comes from our media products. And the large majority of the revenue is from those that have the most media to deliver. The largest several hundred customers would comprise a lot of the revenue. And those folks are big names. And so they really care about their brand. They are big targets for attack, and they care a lot about our security solutions. And so that is why you see the Media Division or the customer revenue for our media customers be growing at a higher rate than the media products per se. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thank you. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the question. If we take a step back, what would we have to see in terms of the growth rates that you're seeing in the business that would cause you guys to maybe dial back on the investments? Is there a certain level of growth that you want to sustain? Or what would you have to see to cause you guys to potentially pare back on the incremental investments on the Enterprise and Security side? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I would say that we manage the company as a portfolio and we look at all the investments that we want to make in product areas and what we believe kind of the return on investment is going to be for each one of them. And as Tom said in his prepared remarks, that our Performance, Security, and Enterprise offerings, have 50% EBITDAs even with the investments that we've been making. And so the Media business goes through spells like this, and what ends up happening is when the Media business goes through a softening, it does pressure near-term margins for the company. I can remind you of a couple years ago when the Media business was growing significantly. You see margin expansion happen very, very rapidly. That's a bit of the nature of the Media business. And so it wouldn't be wise for us to curtail investments in the business because of some short-term disruption in Media growth rates. I don't think that would be in the best interest of our shareholders or the company. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. No, we certainly saw that in 2014 when the Media business was growing north of 20%. So definitely your point's well taken there. If I can just sneak one more on the Media business. If we could get more explicit on the sources of competition, to what extent are you seeing incremental competition from the public cloud providers, AWS, and that cohort versus your (59:11) competitors and then maybe potentially more of the private guys, more of the private Silicon Valley startups? Is there any one group that's being more aggressive than the other? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No. I think when it comes to that Media business, it's aggressive across the board with the entities that you just talked about. And it's been that way for a long, long time. In fact, one group you didn't mention that you would have three to five years ago is the carrier. The carriers were aggressively competing with us three to five years ago or in the past and now they're mostly standardized on Akamai's capabilities. But I think we'll continue to see competition from startups, from the traditional players, and from the cloud providers. And we fare well against the competition, especially in situations where quality matters. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, hi. Thank you for the question. I actually had two of them. One was related to OTT. And I was just wondering what's the potential for the players that are trying to get big in OTT to generate the same problem down the road that you're having with the big platform providers today where the biggest companies who get all the subs end up investing to do this themselves. Like, what are you hearing from them? Is there anything you could share with us to help maybe mitigate those fears since OTT is one of your drivers that you're holding out? And then the second thing was just your comments about the carriers. In particular, can you share with us with the transition to these unlimited data plans and people forcing if you use those to go from HD to SD quality and obviously, the size of those files then becomes smaller. How do we think about that having any positive or neutral or negative impact on the growth that you're seeing through the network? Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Okay. The first question on are we worried about the big broadcasters as they start their own services and grow and so forth, doing more themselves? I don't think so. I think it's going in the other direction. Generally speaking, those folks are taking, doing less in-house maybe than they did before. I think they've recognized this is not their core area of expertise and doing more outsourcing going forward. So I don't see that's an issue. Obviously, these giant platform companies, most of those guys spend billions of dollars a year in infrastructure. And they're just at a different scale where it becomes possible for them to think about spending hundreds of millions more, trying to do some content delivery. So I don't see that being an issue in terms of OTT going forward. If anything, it's going in the other direction. With the carriers, I think we're seeing actually the quality levels for video increase as opposed to a scenario you're describing where it would decrease. And there's competition there and their users, the end viewers, demand the higher-quality video as you get better devices into the home, I think just the opposite happens. You get higher quality levels and we see the carriers already experimenting with sort of super-high quality, which means more traffic. So that, I think, it's more likely to go that way then to lower quality levels. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of them from me. First on the gaming side, it seems to me the shift to background updates has been happening gradually. Was there a specific event or a specific customer that drove what seems to be a bit more \u2013 it feels like the messaging is that this was a bit more sudden than I would perceive sort of the gradual shift to play out as. Any color there? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I don't think there's any specific customer. And like you say, this shift has been taking place. And it's having an impact on traffic growth. So it's not one event, no. I think it's been a trend in the industry. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay. And then with respect to the Ions or the acceleration side, have you seen on renewals pricing \u2013 how would you describe pricing on renewals around Ion and acceleration pricing trends now, say, versus 12 months, 18 months ago? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I think when you come to a renewal for the same product, they always want to lower price. On the other hand, maybe there's more traffic, which helps. And the best part is we've got a lot of new products. There's Image Manager, there's Bot Manager, there's the next generation of Ion focused on mobile, the next generation of Kona, again, focused on mobile. So there's more to bring to bear in the account, which helps us hold price or grow revenue in the base. And so we are seeing revenue growth in the base of customers with our Performance and Security products. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : And how about the actual net customer count growth? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: We don't actually report customer count. We have done that for some time. So really not much to comment there. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay. And then, I guess, just one last one. Just a clarification. You commented on expenses being a bit above the expectations on the back of higher commissions and more aggressive hiring. Both seem a bit counterintuitive given the business trends. Can you just expand a bit on those? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Well, actually, we performed well in Q1. So it shouldn't be surprising that commissions then would be a little bit higher. And relative to my comment about getting recruiting related spend that as I mentioned, last year was a period where hiring was a pretty low period for the company. And our expectation is we're going to step up hiring a bit more this year and so we incurred more kind of recruiting-related spend in the first quarter than we expected, which means we moved a little bit faster than we thought we could. So those are really the two big drivers. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Jeff. So, I think, operator we have time for one more. I know we are running little bit long. So want to be cognizant of that. So maybe we will take one more question. Operator : Yes, sir. Our last question is from Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, one more on the Media Solutions category. Can you give us the split between gaming, video, social and software downloads? And then what are your expectations for some of the new services coming out? I mean, Hulu, potentially Comcast products, potentially Verizon product. For those companies that already have a CDN capability, would you expect that traffic to continue to go to you guys or would they have that traffic on their own platform or it might be a hybrid of both? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Okay. So I'll take those. A lot of the business is video and a lot of it is software downloads. Now gaming, most of the gaming business today is software downloads, just in the gaming vertical. We don't give out the splits, but both are significant sources of traffic and revenue for us. On your comment around Hulu, Comcast and Verizon, the answer is it depends. With Comcast, they have their own delivery mechanism for their own networks. So to get to their own subscribers, they may use their own delivery network. We also have many Akamai Edge servers within the Comcast networks. So we deliver a lot of content to Comcast users as well. Same with Verizon. Verizon has a competing offer, but we deliver a lot of content within Verizon's network. You take a Hulu, that's more of a direct aggregator of content and that's a situation where Akamai would be in a good position to deliver their content. And even in cases where there's a big content provider that maybe is in the same parent company with a big network, even if they have their own capability to deliver in their network, you might well see us doing the delivery of the content for that content provider. Generally speaking, there's a couple of exceptions. But generally speaking, a lot of the video delivery that's done, especially live or for-pay content, we'll be doing that today. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at a number of investor events in May and June in both the Americas and in EMEA and details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. So thank you for joining us, and have a wonderful evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participation in today's conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect.

Baird Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to your Q2 2017 Akamai Technologies Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session, and our instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Tom Barth : Thank you very, Brian. Good afternoon, and thank everyone for joining Akamai\u2019s second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai\u2019s filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company\u2019s view on July 25, 2017. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statement reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today\u2019s call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. Also, please note that all growth rates references will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered solid overall results in the second quarter. Revenue in Q2 was $609 million, up 7% over Q2 of last year in constant currency and at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $0.62 per diluted share, $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range and up 4% over Q2 of last year when adjusted for foreign exchange and the dilution associated with the recent SOASTA acquisition. The second quarter featured continued strong growth from our Web Division customers, who contributed $315 million in revenue, up 16% over Q2 of last year in constant currency. It\u2019s worth noting that Q2 was the first quarter where our Web Division customers accounted for the majority of our revenue. This milestone reflects the success we\u2019ve had in diversifying and growing Akamai, both in terms of new product lines and in terms of the kinds of customers who buy our products. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve grown well beyond our origins as a pure-play content delivery network into the world's largest and most trusted cloud delivery platform. We\u2019ve broadened our product portfolio to include application acceleration in cloud security services, and we substantially broadened our customer base beyond media companies to include many of the world's largest financial institutions, retailers, airlines and auto manufacturers. Innovation has been a cornerstone of our success in developing new product lines, especially in the area of cyber security. Our cloud security business delivered $115 million of revenue in the second quarter, up 34% over Q2 of last year in constant currency. Looking forward, we believe that we can continue to grow this industry-leading business at a rapid pace, with annual revenue expected to exceed $1 billion within the next four to five years. This belief is fueled in part by the opportunity we see for further penetration of our Kona Site Defender, Prolexic, Bot Manager and Web Application Protector product lines. The latest version of Kona Site Defender protects API endpoints for customers, such as leading footwear retailer, DSW, to help secure their websites, mobile infrastructure and other API-driven requests. Our most recent Bot Manager product, Bot Manager Premier, was released earlier this month after a very successful beta with customers such as Hyatt Hotels. Bot Manager Premier features the machine learning technology that we acquired from Cyberfend that is designed to sort even the most sophisticated account takeover attacks. Of course, scale has become even more critical for cyber defense, as typical attacks now contain tens or hundreds of gigabits per second of malicious traffic, more than enough to overwhelm the traditional defenses of even the most well-equipped data centers. This is another area where Akamai Solutions are differentiated in the market due to the enormous capacity contained in the Akamai platform, which can be leveraged by all our security solutions. We\u2019ve also been seeing good traction with our latest web performance products, Ion 3.0 and Image Manager, both of which can greatly enhance the user experience, especially on mobile devices. Mobile applications have become an important area of focus for our customers like the Telegraph Media Group in the U.K., Billabong Sports Retailer and Six Flags Amusement Parks, due to the widespread use of mobile devices and the challenges that can arise with performance and this is an area where we believe Akamai\u2019s superior capabilities can make a big difference. In addition, Ion is now complemented with two new products that we obtained as part of the SOASTA acquisition; mPulse, and CloudTest. These highly differentiated solutions are designed to help customers, such as Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Churchill Downs, measure, validate and improve the business impact of their websites and applications. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of our Web Division. Looking forward, we believe that we can maintain a mid-teens annual revenue growth rate from this customer base, with the potential for acceleration over the longer term as our new enterprise products gain traction in the market. As all of you know, enterprises are rapidly moving their applications to the cloud, and this is leading to changes in a way that IT managers architect their networks and manage their security. Traditional devices located in enterprise data centers are being replaced with cloud services, and we believe this shift creates a substantial opportunity for Akamai to do for the enterprise what we\u2019ve done for the Internet, namely, to make application access faster, more reliable and more secure. Each of our new enterprise products addresses a fundamental need arising as part of the transformation of IT that\u2019s occurring within enterprises today. Enterprise Application Access addresses the growing need for businesses to more easily and securely manage application access for a growing mix of users with different risk profiles and without poking holes on the enterprise firewall. Thus far, adoption of our Enterprise Application Access solution has tracked along the same growth trajectory that we achieved for Kona Site Defender in its first year. This is an encouraging sign that our emerging enterprise business can become as successful as our web security business. Following a very successful beta, we launched Enterprise Threat Protector in late Q2. Enterprise Threat Protector is designed to protect enterprise employees and infrastructure against phishing, malware and data exfiltration attacks by providing a cloud-based recursive DNS service to block access to malware sites and data exfiltration botnets. Enterprise Threat Protector leverages the massive amount of security data that Akamai collects every minute to provide customers like Norwegian Cruise Lines with a layer of intelligent security across all their offices and cruise ships around the world. As a result, Akamai is now protecting, not only the company, but also their employees and passengers from complex targeted attacks. I\u2019d now like to shift gears and talk about our media business. Our Media Division customers accounted for $276 million of revenue in Q2, down 1% year-over-year in constant currency. As has been the case in recent quarters, the performance of our Media Division was impacted by the six large Internet platform customers. These customers contributed $51 million to our revenue in the quarter, down 17% over Q2 of last year. In Q2, they accounted for 19% of our Media Division revenue and 8% of Akamai\u2019s overall revenue. More generally, and as we signaled in our last quarterly call, the traffic from our media customers overall has not grown as fast as we had expected for the year. To be clear, the traffic from our media customers has been growing. In fact, if you pull out the contribution from the six large Internet platform companies, the year-over-year traffic growth rate for our media customers has been well above the 24% growth rate that Cisco reports for the Internet overall. The issue is that our current traffic growth rate is lower than it\u2019s been historically and lower than we\u2019ve been expecting. And this impacts the revenue that we receive from media customers for our media products as well as our web performance solutions. This leads to two important questions; what steps are we taking to improve the media business in the near term? And how do we think the media business will perform over the longer term? I\u2019d like to start talking -- by talking about the longer-term prospects for the media business. As we look to the future, we continue to believe that there is significant upside potential for the media business from the increasing consumption of video online. Already, video accounts for the majority of the traffic on the Akamai platform. And our video traffic has been growing at a substantial rate, faster than the growth rates that Cisco reports for Internet video overall. TGG Research has predicted that over-the-top viewing will exceed traditional broadcast viewing within four years. Even if this prediction is only approximately correct, there is the potential for a very large amount of video traffic to move online, and we believe that Akamai is very well positioned to benefit as a result. That\u2019s because Akamai is widely regarded as the go-to provider when it comes to delivering high-quality video at scale online. We believe that we have an unmatched ability to help our customers offer their viewers the highest-quality viewing experience no matter what device they are using, no matter where they\u2019re located around in the world and no matter how they\u2019re connected to the Internet. Our video support services are another differentiator for Akamai, especially when it comes to live and linear delivery. All this means that media is an important business for Akamai, one that we believe will contribute significant revenue and profit growth in the future, even as we expect the media business to comprise a smaller share of our overall business as we continue to diversify and grow our web and enterprise businesses. Of course, we are very aware of the impact that media customers are currently having on our overall financial results, and I want you to know that we are taking several steps that are intended to improve the media business in the near term, both in terms of accelerating revenue growth and in terms of decreasing cost. First, the media business is now managed by Adam Karon, who has had a long track record of success and operational excellence in growing Akamai\u2019s services business while also tightly managing cost. Adam took on a leadership \u2013 took on the leadership of our media business in March, and he\u2019s implementing aggressive plans with the goal of increasing our traffic share through a heightened focus of providing the best possible service to the top 250 global media companies. These companies account for the vast majority of the traffic on our platform. Some of them also make use of other vendors to deliver a portion of their content, and this provides an opportunity for Akamai. While our share of their business is substantial today, we believe that we can do even better by providing focused support for each customer\u2019s individual needs. In some cases, this means customized integration of unique Akamai capabilities such as accelerated NGS, broadcast operations support, low latency streaming technology and Akamai client software. In other cases, it means differentiated pricing to better conform to customer needs for background downloads, peer-assisted delivery and subscriber-based pricing. And in still other cases, it means leveraging our deep carrier relationships to provide regional pricing and dedicated managed CDN services. Of course, we\u2019ve always worked hard to reduce our costs in the media business, and under Adam\u2019s leadership, there is a renewed focus and sense of urgency to further drive costs down, with an emphasis on the large operational and CapEx costs associated with delivering very large volumes of traffic. Lowering our cost structure will help improve our profitability while also allowing us to pass on some of the savings to our customers so that our services will be even more attractive in the marketplace. It\u2019s important to note that the media business is a cash generator for Akamai today and that it helps to pay for much of the infrastructure that we use to defend the world\u2019s leading enterprises from large-scale cyber attacks. Through the steps we\u2019re taking, we believe that we can further increase the cash flow from this business while also positioning ourselves for the future upside from over-the-top video. As we work to improve the media business, I want you to know that we intend to manage costs in a way that will keep overall company EBITDA margins in the mid to high 30s. We believe that we can do this while still making the investments needed to fuel the growth of our new enterprise business and our highly profitable web business. In summary, I believe that Akamai is very well positioned for future growth, thanks to our world-class and highly innovative technology, our broadening portfolio of services, our diversifying base of customers and our highly talented employees. These are some of the reasons why I remain so confident in Akamai\u2019s future and also why I\u2019m continuing my personal share repurchase program through the rest of the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim to go over the financials in detail, and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Jim? Jim Benson : Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom highlighted, Akamai delivered a solid Q2, with revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range and earnings slightly above the high end of our expectations. Revenue in the second quarter was $609 million, up 6% year-over-year, or up 7% in constant currency, and up 10% constant currency, if you exclude our six large Internet platform customers. Before I dive into the revenue details, please note that all revenue growth rate references will be in constant currency. Looking first to the Q2 revenue results by our customer division lens. Revenue from our Web Division customers was $315 million up 16% year-over-year. We continue to see solid growth and diversification into this customer base, particularly with our cloud security offerings, with over half of Akamai\u2019s second quarter revenue now coming from our Web Division customers. Revenue from our Media Division customers was $276 million in the quarter down 1% year-over-year and up 3% excluding the impact of the large platform customers. As we had projected in our last call, media growth rates are lower than the past several quarters driven primarily from a continued moderation in traffic growth across our media delivery and lower end web Performance Solutions. As Tom outlined we are working diligently to improve the media business. We are confident that our action plan to aggressively increase traffic share could improve our traffic and revenue growth trajectory. We are beginning to see early signs of traction, but it will take a few quarters to realize the full benefits of our actions. Finally, revenue from our Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $18 million in the quarter, up 10% year-over-year. Turning now to our Q2 results for our solution categories, revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions remains strong coming in at $376 million growing 16% year-over-year and contributing 62% of total revenues in Q2. We continue to see very strong growth for these products from our Web Division customer base, although we saw a down tick in revenue from our traffic related web Performance Solutions sold to our Media Division customers. Within our Performance and Security solution category, we saw particularly strong growth continuing in our Cloud Security Solutions. Second quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $115 million up 34% year-over-year led by our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic offerings and our continued portfolio expansion into new areas like bot Management. Our Cloud Security business is now nearing an annualized revenue run rate of a $0.5 billion. Our Media Delivery Solutions revenue was $179 million in the quarter down 9% year-over-year and down 4% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers. As I just mentioned, this revenue moderation was due to further traffic growth deceleration in our Media Division customer base most notably in our Americas theatre. Finally, revenue from our services and support solutions was $54 million in the quarter up 13% year-over-year. Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international Markets represented 34% of total revenue in Q2 up one point from Q1 levels. International market revenue was $206 million in the second quarter up 19% in constant currency driven by strong growth in our Asia Pacific theatre. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $5 million on a year-over-year basis and a positive impact on revenue of $4 million on a sequential basis. Revenue from our U.S. market was $403 million up 2% year-over-year and up 5% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers. Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 76% down one point from Q1 levels and the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin which includes depreciation and stock based compensation was 65% down one point from Q1 levels and up one point from the same period last year. GAAP operating expenses were $307 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $239 million up $11 million from Q1 levels and in line with our guidance. The sequential expense increase was heavily impacted by the absorption of the SOASTA acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $224 million, down $17 million from Q1 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 37%, down two points from Q1 levels, down three points from Q2 last year and in line with our guidance. Approximately 1.5 points of the EBITDA margin reduction is driven by the impact of the SOASTA acquisition. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $89 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $77 million, up $2 million from Q1 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $147 million, down $19 million from Q1 levels and down $10 million from the same period last year driven by the areas I outlined earlier. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 24%, down three points from Q1 levels and from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. Moving on to other income and expense items. Interest income for the second quarter was $4 million, down slightly from Q1 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $58 million or $0.33 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $108 million or $0.62 of earnings per diluted share and slightly above the high-end of our guidance driven by the strong revenue achievement. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $30 million based on an effective tax rate of 34%, up from 29% in Q1 due primarily to the accounting for the SOASTA acquisition. Taxes included in or non-GAAP earnings were $44 million based on an effective tax rate of 29% consistent with Q1 levels and in line with guidance. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 173 million shares, down 2 million shares from Q1 levels and down 3 million shares from Q2 of last year driven by increased share buyback activity. Now I\u2019ll review some balance sheet items. Day sales outstanding for the second quarter was 60 days, up two days from Q1 levels and from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q2 excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $105 million and slightly below the low-end of our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to the timing of some planned network investments and IT projects that shifted into Q3. Cash flow generation continued to be solid with cash from operations of $225 million in the second quarter. Our Balance Sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on-hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $725 million. During the quarter, we spent $105 million on share repurchases buying back roughly 2 million shares. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us with the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times including the share repurchase program. In summary, our Q2 top and bottom line results met or exceeded the high end of our guidance. We continue to see a robust pipeline of innovation and strong revenue growth in our web and enterprise divisions and have put in place plants we believe will improve the performance of our media business. Looking ahead to the third quarter and as signaled in our last call, we expect Media Division revenue to continue to moderate from Q2 levels. In addition, this is a particularly difficult compare period, given last year\u2019s Olympics and various selection coverage events. We are confident that our action plan to aggressively increase traffic share can improve our traffic and revenue growth trajectory. We\u2019re beginning to see early signs of traction, but it will likely take a few quarters to realize the full benefits of our actions. Overall, we are expecting Q3 revenue in the range of $604 million to $616 million. At the high end of this range, year-over-year growth would be 6% in constant currency. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive impact on Q3 revenue of $3 million compared to Q2 and a negative impact of $1 million compared to Q3 of last year. At these revenue ranges, we expect GAAP gross margins of 64% and cash gross margins of 76%. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $241 million to $246 million, up roughly $5 million sequentially at the midpoint, driven by targeted investments in our web and enterprise divisions. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate EBITDA margins of roughly 36%. While we are not providing specific guidance beyond Q3 during this call, we believe continued targeted investment in select areas is the right decision for the medium and long-term growth prospects for the company while we work through our media action plan. In the near term, we intend to operate the company and the mid-30s EBITDA. As we work to improve our media performance and deliver continued strong growth from our Web Division customers, we would expect to see EBITDA margins return to the high 30s. And we remain committed to balancing both top line and bottom line growth over the longer term. Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $80 million to $82 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 22% to 23% for Q3. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.57 to $0.60. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $40 million to $41 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 172 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend $110 million to $120 million, excluding equity compensation. This amount is an uptick from second quarter levels, primarily due to the timing of planned network and IT investments that shifted from Q2 into Q3 as well as some additional infrastructure investments for our Security Solutions. In closing, we remain confident in our ability to accelerate growth rates for the business, execute on our continued product and customer diversification strategy and delivering a compelling financial model for our shareholders. Thank you, and Tom and I would now like to take your questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Just a little more color please on the traffic slowdown. I know you called out the Americas as a region where you had that traffic slowdown. I think last quarter, I think you also called out verticals and you talked about the gaming vertical. Could you spend a little bit more time on which industry verticals were behind that, that you\u2019re seeing are behind that traffic slowdown? Thank you. Tom Leighton : Yeah, sure. As we talked about the deceleration in traffic and remember traffic is still growing, the deceleration is primarily due to the six large internet platform companies that we\u2019ve talked about and as we talked about on the last call, there was some share loss and some large gaming customers in the Americas and that is exactly what happened I would say in Q2. Beyond that, we don\u2019t see any evidence of major share loss. In fact, there\u2019s a lot of accounts where we\u2019ve increased share and our traffic is growing. If you take out the six large platform companies, it\u2019s actually growing faster than the published results for the internet as a whole. So, it\u2019s just the issue is it\u2019s not growing as fast as we\u2019d expected and it\u2019s not growing as fast as the historical trends and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re putting in place some pretty significant steps to increase traffic share and get revenue growing and at a stronger pace including the six largest internet companies. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Tom. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. Mike Olson : Hey, good afternoon. You mentioned that as you drive costs lower in media delivery; you can potentially offer lower pricing to those customers. Is that a big part of the strategy going forward to reduce the gap in pricing between you and your competitors for media delivery? Thanks. Tom Leighton : It\u2019s not a big part I would say, but it is a part. We want to be sure we\u2019re offering competitive pricing. When I talked about several of the steps that we\u2019re taking, a lot of it is around providing the very best service and really customized service to the world\u2019s largest media companies and we\u2019re focused on the top 250 and we\u2019ve got a lot of unique capabilities that I mentioned earlier that we are going to be helping those customers integrate into their platforms. And I think we've much greater focus with those accounts providing exactly the services they need and in some cases, it will involve differentiated pricing if they\u2019re doing a background download or they\u2019re working in a particular geography or if they\u2019re using our client-assisted delivery software that the pricing can be more tailored for them. But pricing is I think a component, and as you know pricing always decreases on an annual basis and we are seeing and as far as we know we\u2019ll continue to see price decreases within historical norms. So, I would say it\u2019s mostly a focus on providing better and differentiated services with a lot more focus and energy there on the top 250 global media companies. Mike Olson : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please proceed. Matthew Heinz : Hi, thanks good afternoon. If I could just go kind of in more detail on your commentary around traffic, it seems as if your traffic is still growing faster than market, but I think the comment was not as fast as we\u2019d like. I\u2019m just trying to square up. Have you lost share, where would you say your share stacks up versus maybe a year or two ago and is the issue more broadly defined in terms of the traffic slowdown and if so, I guess how do you think, why do you think your initiatives will be successful in kind of clawing that back? Tom Leighton : Sure. As we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve lost significant share in the big six internet platform companies due to their do-it-yourself efforts and we\u2019ve talked about that a lot that they drive a lot of traffic on the internet. And just to be clear, even counting that, we\u2019re still growing traffic on the Akamai platform at a good clip. And in fact, if you take out those big six, it\u2019s growing faster than the internet as a whole. In terms of share and as we talked about, we did lose some share in a few large primarily American gaming companies. We\u2019re actually working hard at getting that share back and I\u2019m optimistic about that. Otherwise I don\u2019t see any share loss compared to say last year and in fact, our goal and we\u2019re working hard to do this is to increase share and as I talked about, I think we see strong potential to do that. As Jim mentioned, already the steps we\u2019re taking we\u2019re beginning to see some acceleration in traffic and increase in share. It\u2019s very early and as Jim mentioned, I think you really want to be thinking about a few quarters to see the full benefit from the action we\u2019re taking, and it really is centered around greater focus and energy and customization of what we do for the world\u2019s largest media companies. And as you might imagine, aside from having a lot of traffic and a lot of end-users they have special needs and we\u2019re in a great position I think to satisfy those needs with the right packaging of capabilities for them. And we believe that by doing that we can increase our share, which is already large in the world\u2019s largest media companies. We can increase it and drive revenue growth going forward. Matthew Heinz : Okay, thanks. And then as a follow-up just on the enterprise initiatives, enterprise networking initiatives specifically, I think you made mention that you expect that business to track similarly to how the Cloud Security business kind of ramps in the early days. Can you just provide a little bit more insight around kind of where you are in those conversations, how your Cloud Security products are enhancing your conversations with customers and if there\u2019s sort of synergy there, and how quickly we can expect a meaningful revenue contribution from that business? Tom Leighton : Sure. The buyer of our Enterprise security products is not the same person as the buyer of our web security products, but they do track up to the same CSO and CIO, and our reputation as now the world\u2019s largest pure play web security provider really is very helpful in our customer base and is I think really going to help us jump start our Enterprise security business and the products there today are Enterprise application access and Enterprise Threat Protector. Now, as we look over the long-term, we believe that the market for the Enterprise products is in the long run larger than the web security products and our goal is to grow that business on the same trajectory that we grew the web security business and in the first year, that\u2019s been the case. If we look at our -- the Enterprise Application Access product that we launched through an acquisition late last year, it\u2019s tracking ahead of the first year of where we were with Kona Site Defender, which was our flagship product to get the web security business going. And in terms of the question about when can we see meaningful results, we\u2019re optimistic that we can start seeing results that will make a difference, and then we maybe starting to talk about in terms of the dollar volumes for enterprise security towards the end of next year. And if we stay on the same track we\u2019re on now, that would \u2013 that should be possible, it should make a difference in our results towards the end of 2018. Matthew Heinz : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Hart with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed. Michael Hart : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. The first question I had, I\u2019m trying to piece together the commentary around the pricing actions you\u2019re taking in the Media Division and the efforts around increasing customization as well as your comments about the long-term margin. And I just was wondering if you can offer some color on what you think the long-term impact to margins will be from increasing customization for these customers in the context of also taking actions to maybe provide differentiated pricing to these customers? Tom Leighton : Yeah. I think, in the long run, not only does it grow revenue, it also improves margins. Growing traffic is generally a good thing. And it\u2019s not just about pricing. We\u2019re driving a lot of our costs out of the delivery, and that improves our margins. It does enable us to pass through some of the savings to customers, which we always do, and that keeps our products competitive in the marketplace and not just an issue of competition, but as you look at OTT, which we look as driving a lot of the future growth for the media business, the cost is an important component for our media customers. The broadcasters come from a world of satellite delivery, and in the satellite world, every additional subscriber is free. Now in the Internet, that\u2019s not true. And so, we have to do work to decrease costs to help enable the increasing growth in OTT. Now in terms of what we\u2019re doing with the largest customers, as I mentioned, we\u2019re working hard to take unique Akamai capabilities and integrate them better into our largest customers platforms, things like accelerated NGS, broadcast operations support, low-latency streaming technology, Akamai client software. And these are all things that improve the end user experience, several that do lower costs for everybody for the ecosystem, so that\u2019s a good thing. And there is \u2013 for some of our customers, they need differentiated pricing models to make it work for their businesses. For example, subscriber-based pricing, peer-assisted delivery, folks with background software downloads. In that case, our cost is lower. It makes sense to be able to pass that on to the customer. And in some cases, customers need us to be leveraging our deep carrier relationships in countries around the world. And they need regional pricing, and they need things like dedicated managed CDN services. These are all capabilities Akamai has and, generally, uniquely capable of providing. And they\u2019re going to see and you\u2019re going to see a lot more focused support for the largest customers, and we\u2019re really putting our effort there. And we think, by doing that, we can increase \u2013 we have a large share today. We can increase it substantially. That\u2019ll improve revenue. It will improve our margins and be good for the business. Michael Hart : Okay. Thanks. And then one quick follow-up, the SOASTA acquisition, Jim I appreciated the commentary about some of the impacts to the financials, but one thing which I think I missed was did you offer some color on what the topline contributions for SOASTA was in 2Q and also what you\u2019re expecting for 3Q and maybe when you think SOASTA could be accretive to the EPS line? Tom Leighton : Sure. I spoke about that beginning of the investor summit and a little bit on the last call that because of the deferred revenue impact in purchase accounting, there was a few million dollars for SOASTA revenue in our Q2 results and we\u2019re managing that business as part of our web performance business unit and that\u2019s where it resides. We aren\u2019t going to guide to it specifically each quarter, but what I said during the investor summit is that that business kind of on an annual basis, once we work through the purchase accounting impact of deferred revenue, could be roughly a $30 million business, so that\u2019s the rough profile of what you should be looking for going into 2018. Michael Hart : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Please proceed. Sameet Sinha : Thank you very much. I wanted to actually dive a little deeper into the performance unit. Can you talk about kind of the trends in the marketplace there? And of course, you made the acquisition of SOASTA. Can you talk about where is the demand, is it coming from mobile, is it coming from -- just kind of use cases there and the competitive environment and then I have a follow-up question? Tom Leighton : Yeah, no I think you nailed it. The biggest trend in performance is around mobile performance where the conditions can be particularly challenging for a good end-user experience. That\u2019s what our Ion 3 is all about. Image Manager makes a huge difference for mobile performance. We\u2019re seeing great traction with that new product. And of course, the SOASTA acquisition with mPulse and CloudTest are all about measuring performance, helping our customers optimize it in a way that maximizes their business, and I would say mobile is front and center there. Of course, security, also very important for those customers and that\u2019s partly why you see our security business growing so rapidly as really the industry leader and the only company capable of providing the kind of security that major Enterprises need online today. Sameet Sinha : The follow-up question, I wanted to speak about the margin guidance. I mean you had opportunities to bring that down in the last couple of quarters and now it\u2019s taken another step down. Can you talk about the rationale that you did mention continued investments so if you can delve into specifically where you\u2019re investing in? What product lines that will kind of give us a sense of where we can expect leverage? Thank you. Tom Leighton : So obviously, we talked about the media business and when the traffic has been less than we\u2019d expected and therefore the revenue less than we\u2019d expected. That put pressure on our margins in the near-term and as you know, we\u2019ve just talked about we have an active plan to improve the performance there. When you look at our Web Division there and you see very high margins, you see excellent growth rates; I think it\u2019s really important that we continue the investments there to fuel the growth of that business. If you look at our Enterprise business which is very early days, we now have two products in the market off to excellent start, and we think that has an even better longer-term potential for growth. And so, the last thing we want to do is do anything to interrupt the great performance and growth that we\u2019re seeing there. So, we are incurring lower EBITDA margins in the near term as we work through and improve the media business. And as we talk about, as we do that, and as we continue to drive very strong growth for our highly profitable web business, and as the enterprise business starts to make a difference in our numbers next year, we do expect to see margin improvement. Sameet Sinha : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Vijay Bhagavath : Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, hi, Jim, Tom. Tom Leighton : Hi. Vijay Bhagavath : So, my question is really on the new enterprise opportunities you guys are pursuing. Help us understand the magnitude of the opportunity next year. And when should we start kind of baking it into the model? Would it be as early as the fourth quarter of this year? Would it be front half of next year? And roughly, what are the components of the enterprise opportunity? Would it primarily be this behind the firewall security opportunities? Also, some, like, corporate video offload? So, anything and everything you could help us with this new enterprise opportunity would be very helpful. Thanks. Tom Leighton : Yes, I think it\u2019s everything you mentioned and more. For example, Enterprise Application Access is all about authenticating in a much safer and less expensive way, enterprise employees to get access to enterprise apps. In the past, this was all behind the firewall. And of course, as you know, Enterprise Networks are turning inside out. As cloud -- as enterprise applications move to the cloud, as you need to give access to contractors and third parties and enterprise employees on the move, you need to give them access to those applications. You need to be able to do that, and the traditional approach just isn\u2019t effective anymore. In fact, access that wasn\u2019t intended is the number one cause of data breaches today. And this is an area where you need new ways of doing it, and that\u2019s exactly what Enterprise Application Access does. And that product is now tracking faster in terms of adoption in revenue than our Kona Site Defender product. If you look at Enterprise Threat Protector, which just came out of a very successful beta trial, that\u2019s all about stopping malware, blocking phishing attempts and stopping data exfiltration, which is probably the biggest threat and the biggest expense for enterprises. When they get hacked and they lose their internal data, it\u2019s pretty disastrous. And just in the beta trial alone, we found examples with major enterprises, where we did exactly that. We caught, through this product, data exfiltration happening from, in one case, an air-conditioning unit, that nobody was really thinking that it\u2019s connected. It has a CPU and a full communication stack. Lo and behold, it was infected, collecting the corporate data and exfiltrating it. So, I think the eventual market for these products is very large. You look at the traditional enterprise security market, and traditionally, that was done on your private network, buying devices, that\u2019s a much larger market than web security. And that market is getting turned inside out along with the enterprise network. And those are going to be services that will have to be purchased in the cloud. And we\u2019re in a great position to offer those services. It\u2019s new technology. So, it really is different. It\u2019s not just taking your box and putting it out there in the Internet. That\u2019s not good work that way. These are going to work that way. These are going to be platform cloud services, and Akamai has a lot of experience doing that. Vijay Bhagavath : Thanks. Very helpful. A quick follow-on for Jim. Price competition is a strategy, would that be kind of near term onetime? Or would it be structural in terms of looking to get back some large business in gaming or in software or even in over-the-top video? Thanks. Jim Benson : Well, I think Tom covered that pretty well, as outlined. The plans that we\u2019re going through to increase traffic share in the accounts, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much more to comment on. Tom Leighton : Yeah, it\u2019s not a pricing strategy. Obviously, pricing drops every year, it has for 20 years. And it\u2019s dropping within historical norms. I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s going to change that. Now getting the right pricing model and how the services are packaged which can vary for each major customer that certainly, we\u2019re working on with the major broadcasters and video customers. Vijay Bhagavath : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Sterling Auty : Yeah. Thanks. Sorry for the background noise. But you mentioned this customized solutions for the large media customers. Will that actually take extra investment to customize and for each customer? Or is there a way to make that efficient? Tom Leighton : Yeah. What we\u2019re doing is reallocating investment within the Media Division to weight much more heavily in the top 250 customers and for smaller companies to handle those in more efficient ways. So, this is not a net increase in investment. In fact, Adam is working very hard to lower the costs in our Media Division. Sterling Auty : And that\u2019s the perfect segue. I guess I don\u2019t understand what types of products you would be able to take out on \u2013 to lower the overall cost of products? Tom Leighton : I didn\u2019t quite understand the question. Are you \u2013 so can you restate the question? Sterling Auty : Yeah. So what types of cost, I think you mentioned using background delivery, but what specific costs can you actually take out of that media delivery business? Tom Leighton : There\u2019s lots and we\u2019ve been working to reduce our costs for 20 years there. Every year, pricing comes down, and so does our internal cost. There is things all the way from better CPUs that we buy, better use of that through software improvements so per dollar of CPU, per dollar of Co-Lo, we deliver a lot more traffic. There\u2019s better use of our infrastructure to optimize what each server is doing and when. When you do have opportunities like background downloads, we can schedule the delivery at times to non-peak times. So, you\u2019re taking advantage of Co-Lo. And maybe if we\u2019ve acquired bandwidth as use it or lose it, we would then use that for the background downloads. So, the marginal costs would be vastly less for us, and we can pass some of that on to our customers. We can use peer-assisted delivery and are doing that in some cases. Again, lowering the costs of the ecosystem. It lowers our costs dramatically, and we pass some of that on to our customers. Greater use -- bandwidth costs are different amount in the many hundreds of cities where we\u2019re located around the world, and better use of that can lower our costs. So, there is a lot of things that we do and have been working on for a long time. We have a lot stronger focus and allocation of resources to that endeavor today. And on the go-to-market side, there\u2019s better and more efficient use of our people in terms of interacting with our customers and as we talked about, be a lot greater focus of those resources on the largest media companies and there\u2019s relatively a small number. It really is about 250 customers that comprise the majority of our traffic and very large majority of our revenue today, in media. Sterling Auty : Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed. Michael Turits : Hi guys, Michael Turits, thanks. I wanted to just make sure the two clarification EBITDA margin guide. I think when Tom finished his section he said mid to high 30s and then Jim, I think you said mid 30s. So, I just want to make sure that\u2019s right so it\u2019s mid-30s I assume in the near-term which I would think as kind of a one-year timeframe. Is that how to think of it? Tom Leighton : Yeah, I mean that\u2019s why -- I mean what Tom highlighted is we intend to offer the Company in mid to high 30s. So, we expect to get the model back to the high 30s as we\u2019re going through our media improvement plan as Tom outlined it and as I said it\u2019s going to take a few quarters to see the full benefit of those actions. And so, what we\u2019ve said is in the near-term as we go through that, we\u2019re going to be operating a Company in the mid-30s to make the investment that we need to make in the Web Division, in the Enterprise division in the areas that Tom had outlined. And so, the plan is to do both. Near-term mid-30s, once we start to see the media improvement plans take hold, which is in both on the revenue and the cost side, our expectation is you should then begin to see margin expansion. Michael Turits : Okay and then there\u2019s been a lot of discussion on the call that you guys mentioned about the traffic slowdown, and caution around that and yet, you beat revenue this quarter. You actually guided nicely above the street and it looks like revenue growth is stabilizing a bit instead of decelerating and I don\u2019t know if part of that is but I noticed the Internet Platform Customers are actually flat quarter-over-quarter. So, what\u2019s despite these headwinds from traffic slowing, what\u2019s sustaining the level of growth right now? Is it that the IP guys are just not moving off quite as fast right now or what\u2019s holding you in there? Tom Leighton : Well we do have a little bit of stabilization in the big six customers. We have a great security business which is really meaningful in terms of revenue and growing at a really good clip. We have new product introductions and we\u2019re particularly excited about our Enterprise products and that as I mentioned should start to be noticeable towards the end of next year and those are all very helpful to growing our revenue. The Web Division customer base growing at a very solid clip which we think we can maintain mid-teens there, and so really, the area where we\u2019ve got and we\u2019re planning to do better is around media, and that\u2019s growing share and providing a better service to the top media customers and that will help us grow revenue and I think with some of the technologies we talked about grow margin. Michael Turits : Thanks, Jim and Tom and Tom I\u2019d love to drill down a little bit more in areas of security at some point, but obviously not on this call. Thanks very much. Tom Leighton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please proceed. Colby Synesael : Great. Most of my questions have been answered but just to follow-up on Michael\u2019s question. Last quarter, I think the commentary was that margins could dip below 37% and now we\u2019re saying mid-30s. And I\u2019m just curious is that a difference or are you just using different nomenclature to describe margins and if it is different and you are signaling this quarter versus last quarter some increased pressure, where exactly is that coming from? I know we\u2019ve been talking about media, but is for example, gaming getting worse? Is there now a new sub-segment that\u2019s pushing on that? Is the security business even though it\u2019s growing very strongly, just not growing strong enough to make up for everything? Just a little bit more specificity to understand what\u2019s changed and how that\u2019s impacting margins versus the comments you guys made last quarter would be helpful. Tom Leighton : Yeah, I don\u2019t think anything is substantively changed, Colby. I think what we said last quarter was that we were seeing traffic moderation in the media business and we had even said that we thought it could persist into the back half, and we also said that at that time that we thought that the EBITDA margins would dip below 37. So, kind of mid-30s is we\u2019re not that precise, and we certainly guided to 36. And I think what we\u2019re signaling now is consistent with what we said then. It\u2019s just a matter of I think we\u2019re trying to be very candid about working some very specific actions in the media business. We\u2019re starting to see some of those actions take hold, still early. We think it\u2019s going to take a few quarters to see the full benefits of them and that really is the sole reason why you\u2019re seeing pressure on EBITDA margins, which is challenges in the Media Division customer base that we have our arms around and that we\u2019re working. And I think we\u2019ll be able to work through that in the next few quarters. EBITDA margins in the mid-30s will allow us to make the investments we think we need to in critical areas of the business that will fuel growth for the Company longer term which are huge catalysts for growth of the company that we don\u2019t want to constrain right now. And so, think of it as mid-30s for kind of the next several quarters. And once we start to see the media actions take hold, we expect that we should be able to see expansion from there. Colby Synesael : And then just on the other question, Michael asked around the top six being flat quarter-over-quarter. Was that an anomaly, just something, guess more coincidental or would you expect that the worst of that reduction is behind you and that sub-segment of customers will may now grow effectively in line with the rest of the business? Tom Leighton : Well, clearly the worst of it is behind us by the fact that only 8% of our revenue. And as you know, they were more than double that. Not so long ago. So, the worst is behind us. I think it would be prudent to plan that there could be some further erosion there. That said, we\u2019re working very hard to grow with those customers. I do believe that it makes sense for them to grow their business with Akamai. I think we can do a better job at a lower price point. And you know, in the past we have seen some of those folks that had DIY and they were taking share reverse course and then put more traffic on Akamai. It does take a little while for a particular DIY project to run its course, but at the end of the day I think we do offer a better service at a lower price point. And so, we are working hard to grow that business. That said, I think given what we\u2019ve experienced in the last year, it is prudent to be planning for further declines, but certainly nothing like it just can\u2019t be, because it\u2019s only 8% now like what we\u2019ve seen over the past year or so. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Rob Sanderson with MKM Partners. Please proceed. Rob Sanderson : Yeah. Thanks for getting me in there, guys. So, on the media business you\u2019re talking about a greater traffic and top line deceleration than expected and obviously heading into a cycle of deleverage as that comps together. So, what I want to revisit is what Jim said at Analyst day about the -- I think the comment was that media operated about 25% adjusted EBITDA in 2016 and still have a low 30s long-term target. Can you give us some commentary around where you\u2019d expect this \u2013 the media business to perform from a margin perspective over the next few quarters and against that baseline? And then also, any reason to think the long-term target should also come down? Thank you. Jim Benson : Yeah. Let me preface it with that, we\u2019re a one-segment company. So, we go through an exercise once a year to attempt to take the Akamai cost structure and cut it into our kind of three solution categories. But we actually don\u2019t manage the company internally that way. And so that \u2013 those profiles are kind of our best effort as trying to allocate costs that way and to basically look at general profit models for those businesses to give investors a flavor of what\u2019s the general profile of our media business, our performance in security business and our services businesses and where we think we\u2019re trying to drive them to. And nothing is going to change. I don\u2019t think the models that we\u2019ve outlined, as far as target models for those businesses, has changed in a material way. I do think it\u2019s fair to say that the EBITDA margin pressure that you\u2019ve seen for the company over the last few quarters is specifically driven by the media business. So, the profile that we provided for 2016, if we were to go through that allocation exercise right now, you would see the EBITDA margins for that business have come down. But as Tom said, it\u2019s still a free cash flow generating business. Margins are down from where they were in 2016. I think the actions that we\u2019re taking to reaccelerate growth to drive down costs should yield both revenue acceleration and margin expansion, but it\u2019s going to take time for these initiatives to take hold. Tom Leighton : This is Tom, Brian. I think we\u2019re running a bit over. So why don\u2019t we take one more question. Operator : Yes, sir. Our last question for today will come from the line of Will Power with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. Will Power : Oh, great. Okay. Yeah. Thanks for sticking me in. Tom, just kind of stepping back, I was interested in some of the long-term media commentary and optimism I think video is one of the key. I think you also said that video was already a majority of revenue. So how do investors get confidence that this video growth is really going to help you we accelerate revenue relative to what you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years? Any further color there with respect to just traffic trend, pricing, et cetera would be helpful? Tom Leighton : Sure. Video today is now the majority of our traffic. And that said, we still have a substantial portion of traffic. We have other media customers, software downloads, gaming, some social networking and so video is not yet all of it. Video is growing at a good clip. And I think as you look at the estimates and the modeling that people are doing about the rate at which TV and typical delivery of video moves online, that leads to a very good place for Akamai. And I think it depends now, who will be delivering that. But I think by the models that you look at, a lot of that is ideally suited for Akamai. We do a lot of the delivery for the world\u2019s major broadcasters and also a lot of the world\u2019s major aggregators of video. So, I think it\u2019s not \u2013 you can\u2019t say the next year everybody is going to be watching their video online, but it\u2019s certainly growing. The industry is certainly planning in the long term to have the majority of the video be watched over IP. And that is an excellent outcome for Akamai. And it will probably take us some time to get there, but already it\u2019s a majority of traffic. It is growing at a good clip and it\u2019s growing faster for Akamai than it is for the industry as a whole or the internet as a whole on video. Will Power : Okay. Thank you. Tom Barth : Thank you, Will, Tom. Again, I want to thank everyone for joining us on this call this evening. In closing, we\u2019ll be presenting at a number of investor events throughout August and September and details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com and I want to thank you and again for joining us and have a nice evening. Brian back to you, please. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.",

Welcome to the Q3 2017 Akamai Technologies Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, we will host a question-answer session, and our instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Great. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining Akamai's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on October 24, 2017. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. Also, please note that all growth rates referenced today will be in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered strong results in the third quarter, driven by the continued rapid growth of our security offerings and strong traffic acceleration in our Media business. Revenue in Q3 was $621 million, above the high-end of our guidance range and up 6% over Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP EPS in Q3 was $0.62 per diluted share, also coming in above the high-end of our guidance range. The fastest-growing part of our business last quarter was our Cloud Security portfolio, which grew 27% year-over-year to $121 million in revenue or about 20% of Akamai's total revenue. Our leading Kona Site Defender solution continue to be a primary driver of this growth, and I think recent events can help you understand why. By now, almost everyone has seen the headlines about the breach at a major credit reporting agency that exposed the personal financial data of more than 140 million people. According to published reports, the attackers exploited an Apache Struts vulnerability in a public-facing website to gain access to the confidential data. The company's leaders believe they patched all their sites and apps after the vulnerability was identified. But when there are a lot of sites and apps to update, it's really hard to be sure they're all covered. As it turns out, they missed one and the gap was exploited, with bad consequences for their customers, their brand, and their market cap. This is one of many scenarios where Kona offers significant value. Kona examines all the traffic coming to a website to determine whether it's safe, attack traffic trying to exploit the Apache Struts vulnerability, or other web app vulnerabilities can be blocked by Kona so adversaries won't cause harm. In other words, Kona can be used as a virtual patching layer in front of websites and applications, allowing our customers to be protected even when they haven't patched everything. As this example illustrates, using Kona to provide defense in-depth is more important than ever when it comes to cyber security in today's world. Kona also leverages the enormous capacity in the Akamai platform to protect our customers from large DDoS attacks. By placing our servers in thousands of locations near end users, we can absorb enormous volumes of attack traffic that could easily overwhelm traditional data center defenses. Kona was a major topic this month at Edge, our 10th Annual Customer Conference, where we announced and demonstrated the latest addition to our Cloud Security portfolio, Bot Manager Premier. Bot Manager Premier is designed to use the advanced machine learning technology that we acquired from Cyberfend to stop account takeover attacks. Account hacking is becoming a huge problem. In a recent study, we found that about two-thirds of the login attempts that we monitored across our customer base came from bots that were trying to break into accounts. And these bots are becoming more sophisticated at evading traditional defenses based on things like the number of login attempts that come from the same IP address. To counter this threat, Bot Manager Premier uses artificial intelligence to distinguish machines from human users. It can detect the way humans touch a screen, or press a key, or move a cursor with a mouse, or how people hold and move mobile devices in ways that machines do not. Although Bot Manager Premier has only been in the market for a short while, we already have over 70 customers who are using it to help reduce the billions of dollars that we believe are lost to credential abuse annually. Bot Manager Premier and Kona Site Defender are designed to protect external-facing apps. At our Customer Conference, we also demonstrated a new solution that will enable enterprises to use Kona to protect their internal applications. The traditional way to protect internal apps has been to use firewalls and architectures based on the notion of a perimeter defense. We believe that such methods aren't good enough anymore. That's because the majority of data breaches are now triggered from inside the enterprise perimeter. Sometimes, it might be a malicious employee doing something bad, but more likely it's as simple as an unwitting insider getting infected with malware by clicking on the wrong link, or visiting a compromised external website, and then bringing the infection inside the perimeter, thereby, enabling the attacker to corrupt, destroy or even exfiltrate sensitive data. Last month, a major airline deployed our new solution to protect their internal applications. And within the first week of use, Kona had discovered and blocked 85 attacks that came through trusted insiders. Another new solution that we released in June, Enterprise Threat Protector, helps enterprises prevent employees from getting infected in the first place and also helps stop data from being exfiltrated once the enterprise has been breached. Enterprise Threat Protector provides a recursive DNS service designed to block employee access to infected sites and to enforce compliance policies quickly and uniformly. Customers love that it's very simple to implement, with most getting it up and running in a matter of minutes. As we announced on October 11, we expect Enterprise Threat Protector to benefit from our planned acquisition of Nominum later this year. Nominum provides recursive DNS and enterprise security products for over 100 of the world's leading carriers, across more than 40 countries, and serving 500 million subscribers. Nominum's threat avert service detects suspicious DNS activity and identifies malware in subscriber and enterprise devices, thereby protecting users, businesses and carriers from malicious, noncompliant, or otherwise undesirable content. In addition to bolstering our enterprise security offerings through enhanced data and functionality, we expect that the Nominum acquisition will strengthen our access to the carrier channel for our enterprise security products. I'm happy to report that many of our carrier partners who attended Edge were enthusiastic about the planned acquisition and the opportunity for us to work with them on technology that is so important to the operation of their networks. Most people don't pay a lot of attention to DNS, but DNS is the onramp to the Internet. It's key to managing traffic flows, and it's a great place to insert security. Some of you may remember a year ago when a small DNS provider got hit with a DDoS attack that resulted in a large number of important websites becoming unreachable. By integrating Nominum and working more closely with our carrier partners, we believe that Akamai will be able to help make our customer sites and the Internet as a whole much more resilient in the future. While many of the conversations at our Customer Conference were dominated by concerns over cyber threats and interest in our new security products, there was also a lot of interest among our Media customers in the rapidly evolving OTT landscape and especially direct-to-consumer offers. Based on our meetings with key executives from several of the world's largest broadcasters, Disney's direct-to-consumer announcement in August is an example of what we think may become a trend over the next several years. We believe this would benefit Akamai because of our close relationships with many of the world's leading broadcasters. During our last earnings call, I outlined several steps that we're taking to accelerate revenue and traffic growth in our Media business. I'm happy to report to you today that these efforts have started producing results. Year-over-year traffic growth on the Akamai platform accelerated in Q3 to the highest levels that we've seen in two years. In fact, Akamai's traffic grew faster than the 24% year-over-year growth rate that Cisco estimates for the Internet overall; and our video traffic grew at nearly double that rate. Just last month, we supported a single media event that drove more than 17 terabits a second in traffic. And on that day, we delivered 60 terabits per second overall on the Akamai platform, establishing a new record for our business. To put this number in perspective, 60 terabits per second is the equivalent of 12 million people watching a video streamed at 5 megabit per second at the same time. And 5 megabits per second is a typical bit rate for the over-the-top streams provided by major broadcasters today. It's not hard to imagine audiences that are 10 or even 100 times as large in the future and viewing media at even higher bit rates. This is a key reason why we're so optimistic about the future of our Media business and why we continue to focus on improving the scale, quality, and affordability of our over-the-top Media Delivery services. At our Customer Conference earlier this month, we demonstrated our new low-latency streaming technology which provides an experience that is several seconds ahead of satellite. This is a big improvement over other Internet streaming solutions that are anywhere from 10 to 90 seconds behind satellite, a delay which creates a much less desirable experience for live events and linear broadcasts. At the conference, we also demonstrated our new media client software which draws content from multiple sources to produce an optimal viewing experience for end users, while also providing cost advantages for our customers. We still have plenty of work to do to return to historical levels of revenue growth in our Media business, but it's encouraging to see the hard work starting to pay off as we gain share in the market. There's one last item that I'd like to mention about our Customer Conference, and that's how favorably our customers reacted to the progress we've made in DevOps. Many customers told me how pleased they are to see our advancements in tooling for developers and the ecosystem of partnerships we've built to make developers' lives simpler. We're making great strides in DevOps so the developers and system administrators can work with Akamai their way with the agility they need to deliver their software innovations faster. In summary, I remain very confident about Akamai's prospects for future growth. I continue to believe that our solutions deliver excellent value for our customers and that our innovations will help our customers thrive as the Internet landscape continues to rapidly evolve. I'll now turn the call over to Jim for an update on our financials and the guidance for Q4. Jim? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I dive into the details of the strong third quarter results, please note that all revenue growth rate references will be in constant currency. As Tom just highlighted, Akamai delivered a strong Q3, with both revenue and earnings coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Revenue in the third quarter was $621 million, up 6% year-over-year, and up 8% if you exclude our six large Internet platform customers. Revenue growth was solid across most of the business, with the overachievement versus our guidance driven by a higher-than-expected uptick in Media Division traffic and continued strong growth in our Cloud Security Solutions. Looking more closely at the Q3 revenue results by our customer division lens, revenue from our Web Division customers was $328 million, up 14% over a particularly strong Q3 last year. We continue to see solid growth and diversification into this customer base, particularly with our Cloud Security offerings, with 53% of Akamai's third quarter revenue now coming from our Web Division customers. Revenue from our Media Division customers was $273 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year and up 3%, excluding the impact of the large Internet platform customers. As we outlined in our last call, we've been working diligently to increase traffic growth and share in our Media customer base, and we began to see early traction in the quarter. Our year-over-year traffic growth rate in Q3 was the strongest we've seen since 2015 and exceeded our expectations entering the quarter. Traffic growth was strong across both our Internet Platform Customers and our core installed base, with particularly strong growth coming from our video delivery customers. Finally, revenue from our Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $20 million in the quarter, up 1% over a particularly strong Q3 last year for our carrier business. Turning now to Q3 revenue results for our solution categories, revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was solid, coming in at $381 million, growing 10% year-over-year. This growth rate is a deceleration from historical levels, primarily driven by a moderation in the use of Performance solutions by our Media Division customer base. Third quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $121 million, up 27% year-over-year, led by our flagship Kona Site Defender, and Prolexic offerings, and our continued portfolio expansion into new areas like bot management. Our Cloud Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $0.5 billion, and continues to grow at a very rapid pace. Our Media Delivery Solutions revenue was $183 million in the third quarter, down 3% year-over-year; and up 2%, excluding our large Internet platform customers. This growth rate is an improvement over Q2 levels, driven by traffic acceleration throughout the quarter. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $57 million in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year. Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 34% of total revenue in Q3, consistent with Q2 levels and up 3 points from Q3 of last year. International market revenue was $213 million in the third quarter, up 18% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia Pacific theatre. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $1 million on a year-over-year basis and $5 million on a sequential basis. Revenue from our U.S. market was $409 million, up 1% year-over-year; and up 3%, excluding our large Internet platform customers. Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, consistent with Q2 levels and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%, down 1 point from Q2 levels as we introduced more capitalized software projects on to the platform in late Q2 and early Q3. GAAP operating expenses were $310 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $245 million, up $6 million from Q2 levels and in line with our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $226 million, up $2 million from Q2 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36%, down 1 point from Q2 levels and in line with our guidance. Approximately 1 point of the Q3 EBITDA margin compression is due to the impact of the SOASTA acquisition. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $97 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $84 million, up $7 million from Q2 levels and slightly above the high-end of our guidance as we introduced more capitalized software projects on to the Akamai platform. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $142 million, down $5 million from Q2 levels. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 23%, down 1 point from Q2 levels and in line with our guidance. Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the third quarter was $4 million, consistent with Q2 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the third quarter was $61 million or $0.35 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $107 million or $0.62 earnings per diluted share; and $0.02 above the high-end of our guidance, driven by the strong revenue achievement and a slightly lower tax rate. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $26 million based on an effective tax rate of 30%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $40 million based on an effective tax rate of just under 28%. This tax rate is about 1 point lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 172 million shares, in line with our guidance and down 2 million shares from Q2 levels, driven by increased share buyback activity. Now, I'll review some balance sheet items. Day sales outstanding for the third quarter was 58 days, down 2 days from Q2 levels. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $108 million and coming in slightly below the low-end of our guidance for the quarter, benefiting from our focus on network CapEx efficiency. Cash flow generation continue to be solid with cash from operations of $236 million in the third quarter. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on-hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash, it's approximately $725 million. During the quarter, we spent $129 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 3 million shares. As we've discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us with the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times, including the repurchase program and M&A. We believe our SOASTA acquisition in Q2 and our expected acquisition of Nominum in Q4 are great examples of how we've used the strength of our balance sheet to invest for future growth. In summary, we're pleased with how the business performed in the third quarter. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance range on both the top and bottom line. We've continued to see a robust pipeline of innovation across the business. And we've already seen good traction in our traffic share initiatives, which we believe will improve the performance of our Media Division. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, holiday seasonality plays a large role in determining our financial performance, driven by online retail activity for our e-commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. As a result, the fourth quarter remains the hardest to predict. Also impacting our guidance is the close of our Nominum acquisition, which is expected in mid-November. As we shared in our press release announcing the acquisition, we expect Nominum to be dilutive to earnings over the next four to five quarters due to the impact purchase accounting has on revenue recognition and cost associated with integrating and scaling the business. We expect the acquisition will be accretive to earnings beginning in 2019. Operationally, we plan to integrate Nominum it into our core carrier business and, going forward, we will not be reporting on the Nominum business separately. Lastly, we expect modest foreign exchange headwind from the strengthening of U.S. dollar over the past several weeks. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q4 revenue of $1 million compared to Q3 levels. Factoring in all these variables, we're expecting Q4 revenue in the range of $638 million to $656 million. This guidance assumes roughly 1.5 months of Nominum revenue. And due to the impact purchase accounting has on revenue recognition, Nominum's revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be a modest $1 million. At these revenue ranges, we expect GAAP gross margins of 65% and cash gross margins of 77%, both up 1 point from Q3 levels. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $265 million to $270 million, up $20 million to $25 million sequentially, as the business absorbs 1.5 months of Nominum spend and as we continue to make targeted investments in our Web and Enterprise divisions. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of 35% to 36%. As a point of note, Nominum is expected to compress EBITDA margins by roughly 2 points in the fourth quarter and into 2018 while we integrate and scale the business. As we've said in the past, factors that could impact our EBITDA and operating margin profile would be M&A activities and revenue volumes quarter-to-quarter. As we absorb the SOASTA and Nominum acquisitions, they will weigh on EBITDA margins in the near term. And while we're not providing specific guidance beyond Q4 on this call, we are striving to operate the company in the mid-30% EBITDA margins and low-20s operating margins in 2018. If we are able to continue to improve our Media growth rates and deliver continued strong growth in our Web business, we would expect to see EBITDA margins return to the high-30s. And we remain committed to balancing both top line and bottom line growth over the longer term. Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $84 million to $86 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 22% to 23% for Q4. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.60 to $0.65, inclusive of an estimated $0.04 dilution impact of the Nominum acquisition. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $41 million to $44 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of just over 28%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 171 million to 172 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend $90 million to $100 million, excluding equity compensation, in the quarter. For the full year, this level of CapEx would equate to roughly 16% of revenue, at the low-end of our long-term model of 16% to 18% of revenue. In closing, we remain confident in our ability to accelerate revenue growth rates for the business, execute on our continued product and customer diversification strategy, and deliver a compelling financial model for our shareholders. Thank you. And Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. And our first question will come from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. Wanted to dive into the Media strength, but the performance weakness in the quarter. Sound like it might both be coming from the same set of customers. So can you give us specifics as to what within those changes resonated to gain share and drive Media strength? And what drove the weakness in the Performance piece? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So as I talked about in my remarks, we have some really strong new capabilities for Media, particularly around video. The idea that now we can do live and linear broadcast ahead of satellite, that's a pretty big change over what is otherwise available with OTT streaming typically being 10 seconds to 90 seconds behind the satellite broadcast. The new capabilities from the client side software to be able to take sources of the content \u2013 multiple sources, integrate that and provide a seamless viewing experience for the user and also at a lower cost point for our customers is important. Broadcast operation support is really important for high-quality OTT. The accelerated ingest technology, origin-connect capabilities so we can connect directly with the large broadcaster origins. The focus on the big 250 global media companies that we talked about in the last call, giving them the kinds of packages and capabilities that they want for things like subscriber-based pricing, background downloads where that makes sense, peer-assisted delivery, regional pricing based on our deep carrier relationships, things like managed CDN services. So a lot of stuff that we do that's very unique in the Media business and focused on the big media broadcasters and customers. And we're seeing really strong response there in terms of gaining market share, traffic growth, particularly in video. On the Performance and Security side, obviously, Security doing very well with several new capabilities coming into market over the last several months that we think will drive continued strong growth for our Security products. And in the Web Division, which features the Performance and Security products, 14% growth there. A little bit less than it was last quarter. And part of that driven by some of the things going on in public sector, which tends to be lumpy and there's some uncertainty in Washington right now. And so, that had a little bit of an impact on the Web Division customer base growing at 14% this quarter. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then, just one follow-up for Jim. Thanks for the color on 2018 margins, just in general. But I know we're going to get the question \u2013 I have the question. So as March should have a full quarter of Nominum headwind, shouldn't that be the trough in margins and would you expect steady increase from there? Or is it one of these things where you take a hit, maybe it comes up a little and just kind of flat lines until you see some of those top line drivers that you spoke about kicking in? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I think you're thinking about it the right way. Whether it's a trough or not, Q2 is also a quarter for the company where we do tend to seasonally have an uptick in expenses just in the core business. And so, it'll probably be a little trough in Q1 and Q2, and then it should scale from there. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up to Sterling's question on the Media traffic side. This quarter you talked about two record peaks in terms of Media traffic; September 12, the 60 terabits, and that beat your August 29 peak. So is that any kind of one-off event that you experienced this quarter? Just wanted to understand how sustainable is this traffic growth or is it something to do with your focus now back on the top 25 media customers? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes. So there's always events that take place, and the big events drive the new traffic records. And as we talked about before, any given event itself, because it's a short-duration event, usually doesn't have a lot of revenue associated with it. But when we're talking about the overall traffic growth, we're talking total bytes delivered. And that's not driven by events; that's driven by the top 250. And we were very pleased to see that our total traffic growth in the quarter, the growth rates there being the highest we've seen in two years, higher than the Internet as a whole. And really pleased with the aggregate video traffic growth being nearly twice what you see the established reports saying for the Internet as a whole. So really gaining strong share there. And that's not measured really by these one-off events that sort of get the headlines because that's where you hit the peak of traffic. We're talking about the core business in Media, total bytes delivered. And that's because of the focus on the top 250, the focus on scale, quality at an affordable price, and all the capabilities that I talked about around Media. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, guys, for taking the question. When we think about the Media business, particularly the platform side of the equation, you guys have seen revenues around $51 million for I think this is like three quarters in a row. Is it safe to say kind of like the worst is behind us in terms of the declines that you guys expect from those platform customers and that should grow on a going forward basis or is this more of a pause in what could be a longer term declining trend line? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes. I think with the big platform companies, it appears as they've sort of stabilized at about combined 8% of our revenue, seeing the same quarter-over-quarter. Now we've got a little bit of time still for the year-over-year wraparound effect. So there's a little bit left to see there. But basically, it looks like things have stabilized on that front with the six giant platform companies accounting for about 8% of our revenue. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just one question on pricing, particularly the pricing that you guys get on the video traffic versus the rest of the traffic. How should we think about that, the relative pricing on one versus the rest of the traffic? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes. I think the pricing tends to be higher where it's more difficult to do and there's a perceived higher value. So in terms of bulk bit delivery, if it's something like a background software download, you'd see the lowest probably pricing there. If it's doing something for OTT, live linear video where our customers' users are paying, that's where quality matters the most and where our capabilities matter the most and so we would be, generally speaking, paid more there. Now, of course, the largest volume customers will also pay the lowest rates. And so, when you have very large customers, that will drive a lower price point per byte delivered. So those are sort of the two ways of looking at it. One is sort of the scale, and the other is in terms of the value that's being provided. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. So when we see the video traffic growing twice the rate of the overall traffic, is that a positive for pricing? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I think it's a positive for Akamai. I think we look at the future of the Media business as really being driven by video. There will always be software and gaming delivery, but really the future is the adoption of OTT at real scale. And we're really still at the beginning of that. And when we see the video traffic growing, that's something that we see as a very positive sign for us. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Michael Turits. Thanks a lot. So one question on Media and one on Performance. So it's great the acceleration in traffic growth rates. Is that a function of you guys regaining share given the fact that you've had a new strategy on pricing and how you look at customers, or is it a function of the customers accelerating their, let's call it, organic growth rates? And then I had a question on P&S also. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Well, probably there's some combination there, but we do believe we're gaining share. And that's specifically account by account based on delivering what a major broadcaster needs or a major media company needs. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I think also, when you measure based on the Internet as a whole, we're growing faster than the Internet as a whole... Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Right. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: ...which would suggest we're taking share. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes. So we're comparing against the established reports out there what the Internet's growing as a whole. In some cases, we have competitors that publish reports on how fast they're growing. And so, when we see ourselves growing faster, a lot faster than that, we take that to believe \u2013 as further proof that we're growing our market share. Now that said, I think OTT will continue to grow as a market as a whole, and there's a long way to go there for future growth as I talked about with some of the ways of thinking about 60 terabits a second today and what viewing audiences might look like in the future. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. And then maybe I'll follow up on Media instead of talking about Performance. But on Media, it seems as if it's \u2013 is there a change in your view relative to the Internet platform guys? I guess my thought process \u2013 or (38:25) your thought process was that there was probably still some significant share movement of the DIY guys from this point forward. Has that changed, if you feel like you've actually bottomed at this percentage level? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I don't think there's a fundamental change. The giant platform companies are going to do a lot of DIY; they are doing a lot of DIY now. We're seeing a stabilization in terms of percentage of our revenue, 8% being from those six large platform companies. I think as we look at OTT in the future, those six companies are going to have a reasonable share of OTT. And I think as we look forward, we see a world where there'll be a lot of direct-to-consumer and other distribution mechanisms in addition to those six large platform companies. And that presents a very large opportunity for Akamai. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Tom and Jim. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks very much, guys, and congrats. Nice to see stabilization in the Media Delivery side of the business. Most of my questions have been answered on that front. I want to turn just to Cloud Security, which in the quarter decelerated, but at a consistent rate with I think what we've seen in prior quarters. And as we think about the trajectory going forward, I wanted to just drill into Nominum a bit. So as you stated in your prepared remarks, builds on Enterprise Threat Protector. And if I'm not mistaken, it's a Carrier and Enterprise play. Can you talk about the go-to-market and types of investments you need to make in this channel and how you see them paying you back over time? And perhaps if you looked out into the future, how much of security over time comes from the Carrier channel, looking out three to five years maybe? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I think the Carrier channel is very important for us. Carriers are incredibly important partners. They're our fastest growing channel by far. We're deepening the relationships with the world's major carriers. Nominum helps us do this. They provide a very important technology for the carriers. And then, with the recursive DNS, it's what controls the onramp to the Internet, it's what controls traffic flows across the carrier backbones. We're in a great position to combine that with our capabilities to really help the carriers manage large traffic flows. Now, on top of that, Nominum's built their enterprise services, the enterprise security services that are very synergistic with our Enterprise Threat Protector services. And so, this will help Enterprise Threat Protector and it will help grow the Carrier channel for us; already our fastest growing channel, but I think helps it further. So it's important for us in both senses : first with enterprise security products and capabilities; and, secondly, deepening the relationship with the world's major carriers. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Sorry to do this, but I want to go back to the Media again. You saw some great growth there, 24% year-over-year, but revenue was down year-over-year. So can you talk about the pricing dynamic? I know you talked about some steps you were going to take last quarter competitively to regain some of that. Can you talk about \u2013 I know one of your competitor is in the process of being acquired. Yeah, just talk about what you're seeing in pricing. And was part of the dynamic where in the value curve the bits were that you were delivering? Maybe not OTT, but maybe more on the commoditized side? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. First, our growth was in excess of 24%, which is the Cisco-published stat for the Internet as a whole. Pricing is competitive in the Media segment. It has been from the beginning, for the 19-years we've been in business, and I think it will always be competitive. And we work really hard to provide the best possible pricing for our customers, so they can grow their business on the Internet. We work really hard to lower our costs, so we could be competitive out there and still be profitable in our Media business. So I don't think there's been a fundamental change in the pricing dynamic. Every year, there's more traffic and at a lower price point per gigabyte delivered. We're looking forward, as we gain share, we definitely want to do that. And we do believe it will help us grow revenue going forward and accelerate revenue growth going into 2018. Jim, do you want to add anything to that? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No, I think you covered it pretty well that, obviously, the revenue is a function of traffic and price point. And I think, as Tom outlined, that what we saw was a acceleration in traffic growth. Our expectation is, if we can continue to execute well, you'll start to see that acceleration in traffic growth manifest itself into an acceleration in revenue growth in the Media business. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of James Breen with William Blair. Please proceed. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question. I think, it might have been last quarter, you talked about on the video game side seeing a little weakness here in some of the updates. Are there any particular verticals this quarter that you saw strengthen that you hadn't in the past? And then just with the big six, are you seeing \u2013 the revenue's been stable now for three quarters \u2013 any different types of traffic that you can tell that you're getting or not getting from them and has that shifted over time? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I think we're very pleased to see, within the Media area, very pleased to see the growth in video traffic. That's, of course, where we're focusing. And that's been, I think, the major change from prior quarters. And I think with the big six, again, we're going to get used more for video, we're going to get used more for live and linear events within video. So not a fundamental change there. Of course, we did do some very large events that we talked about; and those were for some of the giant platform companies. So not a fundamental change. Again, if quality matters, which it does more for video, there will be more business turning to Akamai. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: And then, just quickly on the housekeeping, how much did you spend in buybacks during the quarter and then how much free cash flow did you generate? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: So we spent about $129 million in the quarter in the buyback, and our cash from operations was about mid-230s. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Yeah. Hi, Tom and Jim. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Hi. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. It'd be very helpful for us to know in terms of what are the sustainable drivers for traffic volumes? And the reason I ask is, traffic volumes have been lower than expected recently and then we saw this acceleration. So what's driving the acceleration? And is part of the acceleration due to this move to your off-peak pricing strategy? Is that starting to resonate with some of your top customers? Is this why perhaps we could see like sustainably high traffic volumes moving forward? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I think the sustainable drivers for traffic are focused around OTT and the growth there. And, for us, to gain share there is the focus on quality, on scale, on affordability, on the functionality that we talked about. Low-latency streaming, being as current or better than satellite, instead of 10 seconds to 90 seconds behind satellite for the client-side software that provides even better quality and potentially lower price, for capabilities like accelerated ingest or connecting directly to our large customers' origin, broadcast operation support. All these things that Akamai uniquely does, I think, help us and our sustainable drivers for traffic growth for Akamai. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. A quick follow-on would be on the enterprise security business. I mean, arguably you've done many interesting acquisitions recently. So when could we start seeing enterprise security inflect as part of security revenues? Would it be sometime like front half or second half next year, so helps us model the security business as enterprise starts waterfalling in? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Right. No, good question. These are very early days. We just released our first product, as we've talked about. And we'd like to see it start to make a difference at the end of 2018. So it's big enough that you'll start to notice, and we'll report it out separately. Our goal is to have the same kind of growth trajectory we had for web security, which was nothing about five years ago, and now is on a $0.5 billion a year run rate. So that's the goal, which would mean we'd start to see something meaningful by the end of next year. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Rob Sanderson with MKM Partners. Please proceed. Rob J. Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC : Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question. I want to dig into the Web Performance business a little bit. Growth of 4% by my calculation, that's pretty significant deceleration from the 8%, 9%, 10% that we've been seeing recently. So I've got a few questions. I think the large majority of this business is recurring revenue. Should we assume that bookings and renewals are both fairly weak here? Or is there more lumpiness or what we used to call bursting revenues years ago in this business? Second question is, I think this is an area that management has identified as where you could be growing faster. I know there's been some reorg and some leadership changes over the past couple years. Can you comment on your satisfaction or dissatisfaction in those efforts? And then, finally, how would you characterize the competitive dynamic as it relates to the slowdown in growth from Web Performance products? Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. We, principally, don't look at it from the product perspective there. There's such a blurry line between the Media products and the low-end Performance products. And so, the Web Performance product number gets caught up in Media. So I don't think it makes sense to look at it that way. I think the right way to look at it is what the Web Division number is, and that grew at 14%. Of course, Security is an important part of that, but so is Performance. And we have more revenue from our Performance products there than we do Security still. So I would say that business is strong and growing in a good clip. Like all of our businesses, it's very competitive. And we have seen some burstiness in public sector, which is part of our Web Division customer base. And as we talked about, there's a little bit of softness there right now. And that helped contribute to go from a 16% growth rate in the Web Division to 14%. So I think that's the right way to look at it. You don't get caught up in anything that's going on around Media, and whether they're buying Media products or Performance products. Think of it as the Web Division customer base. That's how we think about it. And it's at a very healthy 14% growth rate. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on the Performance business as well. I was wondering if you could talk about year-over-year pricing trends in the quarter for Performance, in particular? And also kind of how this compares to what you've seen for the year? And also, I mean, maybe I missed it, but can you give us an idea of the amount of revenue there that's driven by the Media customer overlap and how we should think about that going forward? Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I think the pricing trends are pretty typical in the Performance business. Every year, the pricing based on traffic comes down per byte delivered. We do have several new products there that are very successful. There's the entire security product line that we talked about. We also have Image Manager, which is new in the last year, getting a lot of success in terms of the Web Performance products. We have now the mPulse and the SOASTA products now in the marketplace getting traction. We have the mobile SDK for the mobile apps. An increasing the amount of the traffic is going to mobile apps. And so, the API traffic there is very important. So those are new products that we're bringing to market. And that helps offset the normal decrease in pricing, so that we actually grow the revenue we're receiving for our Performance products in the existing customer base. And I wouldn't really think too much about the overlap of the low-end Performance products that our Media customers can buy. Think about it in terms of the Media Division and what they're doing; and a lot of that we're focused on there is on video. And then, you think about the Web Division customer base, which is pretty much everybody about media and carriers. That's the vast majority of the Fortune 1000, and they focus on the Web Performance products and the web security products. And we're seeing very strong growth there. No unusual behavior, I would say, in pricing. And the good news is, there's new products we're bringing to market, not only in security, but also in Web Performance that are gaining traction. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. I guess, what I was trying to get at is just the Performance business decelerated year-over-year. And it used to be a line that I think people thought of as kind of the high-single digit performer. Are these new products that you're talking about, just is that stuff that will help the growth next year or is that something that they were in the market for all of Q3? I'm just trying to get a sense for the deceleration and how do we think about just that Performance line when we think about sustainable growth rate going forward, because that also includes the SOASTA acquisition, if I'm not mistaken. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Right. I think the new products will help the Performance product revenue going into 2018. They are new this year, so they're at very early stage in terms of their overall revenue contribution. But, yeah, I think you will see improvement in 2018 based on those new capabilities. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Michael Hart with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. There's been a lot of questions that I had already asked, but I wanted to dig into something that hasn't come up as much yet. In recent quarters, you've consistently called out the Asia Pacific region as driving strong growth within your international segment. I was wondering if you could provide any incremental color on maybe what kinds of customers or solutions or maybe any particular countries that are really driving the strong performance there. And then also one quick housekeeping question. On the Nominum deal, can you tell us what the price you paid was? And I assume it will be funded from cash on the balance sheet. I just wanted to confirm that. Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. APJ continues to be a strong growth region for us. We also had good growth in EMEA, but APJ leading the way. It's similar kinds of customers and solutions that we sell here, but there's just a lot of growth in that region as a whole and for us in particular. And you think about it, a lot of the Internet users are there, a lot of the major device manufacturers are there, a lot of the world's major enterprises are there. So it's not too surprising. And it's the countries you'd expect that are leading the way. Japan being very strong, Australia being strong, Singapore and Southeast Asia having strength. So I would say there's nothing really unusual there, sort of what you would expect knowing our business. And, Jim, you want to talk about Nominum? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I don't think it would be appropriate to talk about the price for Nominum. The deal hasn't closed yet. The deal is supposed to close kind of in the next couple weeks. You'll certainly see it in our Q4 cash flow statement, but I'd rather not comment on it right now until the deal closes. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay, understood. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. I'll just ask one question, please, on OTT. Is there any way you could quantify what percentage of traffic \u2013 or what percentage of revenue that currently constitutes? And just an outlook just on the OTT segment or that channel. Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. We don't split that out. But obviously that segment is growing more rapidly within the entire Media portfolio, but we don't give that split on a quarterly basis. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks anyway. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Barry Sine with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed. Barry Michael Sine - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey. Tom, at your Edge conference in Las Vegas, I thought your presentation with SOASTA was pretty compelling. I know you've only had it for a quarter or so, but could you talk about how that's driving? And I guess that really drives revenue from other products. But what's been the customer reaction from that presentation and then using that tool with customers? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. We got a great response at our Customer Conference. For those of you who weren't there or didn't see the video, we offered a free 30-day trial, a freemium capability. And we were really pleased to see that a lot of customers signed up on the spot to try it out. And we derive revenue in two ways from SOASTA. One is when they buy the service on an ongoing basis, because it really helps them manage their websites and apps more effectively and their online businesses more effectively. And then, of course, when they see the benefit they can get by adding new Akamai capabilities, there's a very strong tendency to buy those capabilities from Akamai. And so, we get revenue from our other Performance services on top of just the plain SOASTA revenue. So we were very pleased with the response and really excited that customers on the spot there could turn it on and start seeing what's going on with their websites. Barry Michael Sine - Drexel Hamilton LLC : And then a question for Jim on the buybacks in the quarter. Where you are right now in the aftermarket, the stock was as much as 20% below that in August. So you had a pretty good opportunity for buybacks. What was the philosophy there? What's the philosophy going forward? Do you have the ability to drive buybacks higher? The stock is still relatively undervalued where it's been historically. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I think we've talked about it before that the way our buyback program works is it's an algorithm and it basically is an algorithm that buys back more shares and spends more money when the stock price is at lower valuation levels and it buys back less when the stock price is at higher valuation levels. So you certainly saw that the uptick in Q3 was a function of our belief that obviously the company's valuation was low. As you can imagine, we're fortunate to have the benefit of generating a lot of cash as a company and having a fair amount of cash available to be able to do both buybacks and M&A. And so, buyback has been an important component of our capital strategy. As you can imagine, one of the things we've talked about is that we've been acquisitive in areas, most recently with SOASTA and next with Nominum, and so we'll modulate the buyback program based on also firepower that we want to have available for M&A. But we viewed Q3 as an opportunistic time to spend more on the buyback. Barry Michael Sine - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. Thank you. So three brief ones. One, if you could just touch on Nominum's pre-acquisition growth rates to give us a little context of the trajectory of the business. And then the second one, around network utilization overall, I know you don't quote a number, but as you stand now, how are you positioned with respect to overall network utilization and maybe compared to the last two, three years? And how do you envision maybe the next year or two playing? Maybe asked differently, do you intend to operate the network at a higher utilization rate? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Take the first one? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. The first one is that, as you can imagine, Nominum's growth impact on Akamai is going to be fairly minimal early on because of the impact of deferred revenue and purchase accounting, because a very large percentage of their business is a license and perpetual revenue stream where we're not going to be able to recognize that revenue until we resell their business once we bring them on. But their business, on an organic basis, was growing in kind of the high-single digits. But combined with Akamai, we think that we're going to be able to integrate that, as Tom mentioned, some of the capability into our security offerings and increase the revenue growth rate. It's going to take a while to anniversary this deferred revenue impact. So you should expect to see their business kind of begin to accelerate, from a growth rate perspective, throughout 2018 and more notably into 2019. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. And on the second question, I think we're in very good shape there. We talked about recently doing 60 terabits per second of traffic, and I can tell you there was plenty of headroom on top of that available for us. And, as you may know, we put a ton of work into always improving the efficiency of our software and platform, and that helps us get more bits per second out of every dollar we spend on colo or a CPU. And so, we have plenty of room now. And as we go into next year, what we have will be able to produce even more. So that's an area where we're pleased with the progress we're making, and I think we're in pretty good shape. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Maybe if I can just try one other question here. With respect to last quarter, you touched on your intention to drive some differentiated pricing. I think that's the words you used. As you look at the contracting structures and pricing methodologies, particularly on Media this quarter, can you color that in a little bit what did differentiated pricing look like as it sort of played out in the field? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Things like per subscriber pricing, per geo or per carrier pricing, pricing depending on a particular customer's needs. So just a lot of flexibility there so that we can align our pricing to our customer with their revenue model so that it takes a little of the risk off of them and they can run their businesses more effectively. So that's the kinds of things that we are doing in the marketplace as customers come up for renewal. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Got it. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Please proceed. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. And just looking at fourth quarter guidance, if I make my assumptions about revenues from SOASTA and Nominum, seems like you're guiding to, at the midpoint, a slight slowdown from the third quarter at about 4%. Just wanted to understand the dynamics in the fourth quarter. I can understand \u2013 you spoke about e-commerce and how this is an unpredictable quarter. Is there some impact potentially from the Presidential elections on a year-over-year basis as well? So if you can provide some clarity. And, secondly, last call you had spoken about just managing costs and cost reductions. Can you talk about your initiatives in that direction and how we should think about it as we head into next year? Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Sure. So on the Q4 revenue guidance, actually, we think this is a pretty robust guidance. We had a very, very strong Q3. Actually, and as we mentioned, significantly better than what we expected going into the quarter. And, as you mentioned, that the holiday seasonality plays a large role in where Q4 revenue land. So we think it's a reasonably strong guidance. I think it is fair to say that we had an exceptionally strong Media quarter last Q4, so there's a pretty significant difficult compare in the Media business year-on-year. But I think, as I color the guidance, that I think that \u2013 if the holiday season and the e-commerce season is strong, we would expect to be kind of towards the higher end of our guidance. And if it's not as strong, maybe to the lower end and kind of, call it, the midpoint, call it, having a solid holiday season. And again, last Q4 was a very strong holiday season and was a very strong e-commerce season. So tough to predict what's going to happen. Those things are somewhat out of our control, all-in making sure that we're the provider of choice for that business. And as far as cost efforts, I think Tom commented a little bit on it. We are continually focusing on cost, in particular around driving more network costs out of the platform, driving bandwidth costs down, getting more efficiency out of collocation, software efficiencies to get more kind of throughput out of our servers. So there's a lot of activity. That's not something new. It's something that we continue to do. You kind of heard from my guidance for the fourth quarter that we're expecting an uptick in gross margins from Q3 to Q4. Invariably, some of that is seasonally when revenue grows like it does Q3 to Q4, but you can also read into that that we're making continued progress on our network cost efficiencies. And we do the same thing on the OpEx side, that some of what you've seen here recently with some compression for the company's EBITDA margins has been heavily driven by acquisitions that we've done. And it takes a while to absorb and scale these acquisitions that we think are the right things for the business. And then, there are targeted areas of investment that we want to make sure that we're investing in even with what's been happening kind of more recently with our Media business slowing. So this is a pretty balanced approach we take to the business, focusing on managing costs in the network and focusing on managing and kind of prioritizing cost around OpEx as well. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Operator, this is Tom. We have time for two more questions. Operator : Understood. Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed. Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. I was wondering if you guys could give us a midyear update in terms of adjusted EBITDA margins within the Media, Web Performance and Security categories. And then, just looking at the growth rates coming back to a little bit higher this quarter in the Media side, is your expectation still to achieve double-digit growth in 2018? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. The first one is, we provide an annual update on EBITDA margins. Again, we don't manage the company that way. That is just a \u2013 we do an annual exercise to go through allocating the company's costs into the various businesses. And so, a Media update would kind of be not appropriate. I'll certainly provide an update on the margin profile of our businesses, and probably more notably even our divisions at the upcoming Investor Summit that we'll do in Q1. But I think it's fair to say, call it, in aggregate without even having even done the model that some of what you're seeing is probably a modest compression in the EBITDA margins for Media and probably stable margins within the Performance and Security business. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: And with the growth rates, we are looking to get to double-digit growth rates for the company by the end of 2018. We believe that we can do that and looking forward to that next year. Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And just one quick one to follow-up, the compression in the Media and some outperformance in the Web Performance, is that relative to the margins you laid out in your Investor Day presentation? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. And again, as I said that we'll update them again in Q1, because we don't do it and we don't manage the business that way. I've just given you some general qualitative color. But, yes, it would be compared to what I shared in Q1. Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please proceed. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for fitting me in. As it relates to video, which you've stated is obviously a driver of traffic, I was wondering if you could tease that out a little further to try and get a sense of where that's coming from. Maybe (01:09:36) to bucket it as either social media, or broadcasters, or those providing subscription, OTT players, or maybe there's a different way that you would think about it. Just trying to get a better sense of where that's actually happening or where that happened in the third quarter. And then, secondly, I think last quarter you mentioned that obviously you're focusing on the top 250 media customers. But by definition, you're also de-emphasizing those below that. I was wondering if there was any work done with that already and if that's leading to any type of margin improvement that might be happening with the company as well? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. On the last question, you want to think about it as reallocation of resources which we've done a bunch of and in the process of doing to get greater focus and more return for the investment. As Jim talked about, we are very serious with how we invest every dollar. In terms of the video traffic growth, we saw strong traffic growth really across the board, but I think you want to think of it as more broadcaster OTT high-quality video than social. And I think in the long run, OTT will \u2013 the big bits will be driven by the broadcaster, the high-quality long-form content. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you. In closing, we'll be presenting at a number of investor events throughout the rest of this quarter. Details of these events can be found in the Investor Relations section at akamai.com. And we thank you all for joining us, and have a wonderful evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude the program, and we may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 Fiscal Year 2017 Year-End Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 6, 2018. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, driven by the continued rapid growth of our Security offerings and the strong seasonal performance of our Web Division customers. Overall, revenue in Q4 was $663 million, $7 million above the high end of our guidance range, and up 8% year-over-year as reported. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.69 per diluted share, $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range, down 4% year-over-year as reported, and up 1% when adjusted for foreign exchange and the dilution associated with the acquisitions of SOASTA and Nominum. For the full year, revenue was $2.5 billion, up 7% over 2016. Non-GAAP EPS for 2017 was $2.62 per diluted share, down 3% year-over-year as reported, and up 1% over 2016 when adjusted for foreign exchange and the dilution associated with the acquisitions of SOASTA and Nominum. We were particularly pleased to see the year-over-year revenue growth rate from our Web Division accelerate to 17% in the fourth quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by strong demand for our new products, including Digital Performance Management, which came from our SOASTA acquisition, Image Manager, and Bot Manager Premier. Hundreds of customers are now using these products with the strongest adoption coming from the verticals such as travel, hospitality, retail, and finance. And it's not hard to see why. With our new Digital Performance Management products, our customers can discover how to optimize their websites and applications for maximal performance, make sure their site infrastructure has adequate capacity, and track in real-time the business gains that are provided by Akamai's acceleration services. With Image Manager, our customer's images are automatically modified in the Akamai cloud to help optimize performance, cost, and the end user viewing experience. And with Bot Manager Premier, our customer's content is protected against the wide array of bots that are causing unnecessary and expensive load on their infrastructure, or even worse, attempting to steal sensitive data and/or break into end user accounts. The combined revenue from these new products grew eightfold over the prior year and is now approaching a run rate of $100 million per year. As you might imagine, we're very pleased to now be realizing the payoff of investments that we've made over the last few years in the acquisition and development of these new products. Our new Enterprise Security products, Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector, also performed well in Q4, with the number of units sold nearly doubling over Q3 levels and more than tripling over Q1. It's still early days for these products, but we believe they're well-positioned to benefit from the changes that are taking place in the area of enterprise network security. Many security experts believe that it's no longer safe for enterprises to rely on our corporate firewall to protect their sensitive applications and data. We now live in a world of zero trust, where enterprises need to protect against the enormous damage that can be caused by a trusted insider when they click on the wrong link. As Forrester recently wrote, the idea of a corporate perimeter becomes quaint and even dangerous in today's world. It's now just too easy to circumvent traditional enterprise defenses, which is the key reason why there are so many disastrous data breaches. To be safe today, you need novel products like Akamai's Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector. By deploying these products in combination with our industry-leading web security products like Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager, we believe that Akamai could now provide the same level of protection for internal enterprise applications that we do for consumer-facing applications, and at a lower cost than using traditional and less effective data center-based security solutions. We're also making good progress in our Media business. Although media revenue was down slightly in Q4 due to price reductions during renewals for several of our largest customers, our traffic share continues to expand based on the actions that we began taking under new leadership last year. Overall, our year-over-year traffic growth rates exceeded industry averages in Q4, with our OTT traffic growing by about 50% over Q4 of 2016. As we look forward to 2018, we believe that we've turned the corner in the Media Division, and that Media revenue will begin growing again and improve throughout the year. Looking farther forward, we remain very optimistic about the potential for substantial revenue growth from our OTT customers. We believe the traffic from the delivery of long-form premier video content could increase by a factor of 10 to 100 or more in the future, and that Akamai is very well-positioned as the provider of choice to deliver a significant portion of this traffic. Jim will talk more about our guidance in a few minutes. But because of the work that we've done to improve the operational effectiveness of the Media Division and because of the success that we've been having with our new Performance and Security products, we believe that we'll be able to modestly accelerate our revenue growth in 2018. And because of the actions that we've taken to improve our operational efficiency, we believe that we'll also be able to expand our EBITDA margins in 2018 from about 36% in Q1 to about 39% in Q4. Overall, we expect EBITDA margins in 2018 to be about 37%, which matches what we achieved in 2017 and puts us on an upward trajectory that we will continue working to improve in 2019 and beyond. And as Jim will explain in a minute, we expect to achieve similar levels of improvement in our operating margins going forward. As part of our effort to improve operational efficiency, we reduced headcounts in targeted areas of the business, most notably in areas tied to our Media business. Overall, we have removed about 400 positions or 5% of our global workforce in a series of actions that began last quarter and that continued this week. Jim will discuss the charges that we have taken in Q4 and that we plan to take in Q1 associated with these reductions. It's important to note that while we've made reductions in some areas of the business, we are also investing in areas that can return greater value going forward. In particular, we are planning to grow our lead generation and go-to-market functions in the Web Division, with a focus on new customer acquisition; increase investment in high-value services and support for customers, especially in the area of Security; complete the integration of Nominum and strengthen our partnerships with major carriers; continue to invest in new products, especially in the area of Security; and develop novel technology to help our customers realize the potential of the Internet of Things. As always, you can expect us to be disciplined with our investments, as we continue to develop the technology that enterprises will need to flourish in the rapidly evolving digital marketplace. And as we've successfully done over the last five years, we intend to continue to diversify the business, both in terms of the customer base and the product set. Akamai has accomplished a lot over the past five years. Despite the challenges encountered by our Media Division, we've nearly doubled our revenue, growing from less than $1.4 billion in 2012 to just over $2.5 billion in 2017. We've also expanded non-GAAP EPS by over $1 during this period, growing from $1.60 per share in 2012 to $2.62 in 2017. The investments we made have diversified our business from a media-dominated CDN into a leading supplier of web and security services for a broad range of customers, including many of the world's major commerce companies, financial institutions, airlines, and auto manufacturers. Our Web business has grown to represent the majority of our total revenue, and we've grown our Security business from a few million dollars of revenue in 2012 into the premier supplier of DDoS and web security services, generating well over $0.5 billion in annualized revenue and still growing in over 30% per year. One of the great features of our business model is the way that each of our products is built on a single global platform, 20 years in the making and massively distributed across thousands of locations inside 1,700 partner networks, close to where all the end users are. This multi-tenant, multi-product platform is unparalleled in the industry and near impossible to replicate. And when combined with our unique software and algorithms, we believe that it provides a fundamental competitive advantage in the marketplace. While our business and financial improvement are always top of mind, I'm also pleased about the way that we have grown and operated the business. Akamai has received many recognitions over the past several years for being a best place to work and a highly innovative company. But perhaps the most gratifying recognition was made in December, when after evaluating nearly 1,000 of the largest publicly traded companies, Forbes and JUST Capital ranked Akamai in the top 40 and second among all Internet companies for ethical leadership, product quality, and for treating our customers, communities and employees well. In summary, while I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made, I'm even more excited about what lies ahead. Akamai has tremendous potential for profitable revenue growth in the future, as more video moves online, more business moves into the cloud, billions of devices get connected, cyber-attacks increase in scale and sophistication, enterprises enter a world of zero trust, and the need for our services to make the Internet fast, reliable, and secure becomes more important than ever. Thanks very much. And I'll now turn the call over to Jim to review our financial results and to provide the outlook for 2018. Jim? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the details, I'd like to provide a framework for today's financial discussion because it will be slightly different than past calls. Namely, I'll be focusing on key financial highlights from the fourth quarter, a few housekeeping items, and end with guidance for Q1 and an outlook for the full year. I will be leaving some of the finance and accounting details, including 2017 full-year results, to the press release and financial statements, all of which can be found on the Investor Relations website. As Tom outlined, Akamai had a strong fourth quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance on both the top and bottom lines. Q4 revenue came in well above the high end of our guidance range at $663 million, up 8% year-over-year or 6% in constant currency, or up a healthy 9% if you exclude the six large Internet Platform Customers, representing a slight acceleration for Q3 levels. Revenue growth was solid across most of the business, with the overachievement compared to guidance, driven by the continued rapid growth of our security services and a robust holiday commerce season in our Web Division customer base notably. Revenue from our Web Division customers was $355 million, up 17% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency, an acceleration from Q3's growth rate driven by a higher-than-expected uptake or uptick in holiday commerce traffic, strong uptake for our new products, and continued strong adoption for our Security Solutions. We continue to see solid growth and diversification in this division, and our Web Division customers now represent roughly 54% of Akamai's overall revenue. Revenue from our Media Division customers was $284 million in the quarter, down 3% or 4% in constant currency, and down 1% excluding the large Internet Platform Customers. Traffic growth was solid across both our Internet Platform Customers and our core installed base, with continuing strong growth coming from our video delivery customers. Our Media Division management team has been focused on capturing more traffic share with the top 250 media customers that account for most of our traffic and revenue. Because of these efforts, which we initiated in the middle of 2017, traffic growth accelerated and exceeded market growth rate in both Q3 and Q4, and we are confident that we will see continued traffic acceleration, as well as the beginning of revenue acceleration in our Media Division customer base heading into 2018. As I've mentioned in the past, when we restructure customer contracts as we did in the second half of 2017, there is typically a six to nine-month lag from the improved traffic growth to acceleration of revenue. Turning now to our Q4 results for our solution categories, revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was solid, coming in at $416 million, growing 13% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency, and contributing 63% of total revenues in Q4. We continue to see very strong growth from these products within our Web Division customer base notably. Within our Performance and Security Solution (sic) [Solutions] category, we saw particularly strong uptake in our new product areas, namely Image Manager, Digital Performance Management from our SOASTA acquisition; and Bot Manager, as well as continued strong growth in our core Cloud Security Solutions. Fourth quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $135 million, up 32% year-over-year or 31% in constant currency. That's up 32% for full year 2017, capping up another tremendous year of revenue growth and customer adoption of our Security Solutions globally. Entering 2018, our rapidly growing Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of well over $0.5 billion. As Tom mentioned, we believe Security presents a tremendous growth opportunity for us, and we will continue to invest in this area to further enhance and extend our product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities. Revenue from our Media Delivery Solutions was $190 million in the fourth quarter, down 3% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency, and roughly flat year-over-year, if you exclude our large Internet Platform Customers. It is worth noting that Q4 is a bit of a tough compare, because it had several large gaming and software update releases. And as I said earlier, we are confident that our traffic share capture initiatives will lead to an acceleration of revenue growth in 2018. Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 35% of total revenue in Q4, up 1 point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $234 million in the fourth quarter, up 21% year-over-year or 17% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. Revenue from our U.S. market was $430 million, up 1% year-over-year, and up 4% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers. Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, up 1 point from Q3 levels and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 65%, up 1 point from Q3 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $269 million, up $24 million from Q3 levels and in line with our guidance. There has been increasing interest from some investors to understand the components of our general and administrative operating expenses or G&A relative to our peers. While our financial disclosures have always been robust in this area, we've included an additional G&A spend table in today's earnings press release to provide further clarity. This table breaks out costs associated with our administrative functions of finance, purchasing, order entry, HR, legal, IT, and executive personnel, expenses that are typically before the G&A by most companies. The table also identifies costs related to our network infrastructure function, which is responsible for network planning, sourcing, architecture evaluation, and platform security activities, as well as our global facilities infrastructure and depreciation spend. These costs are not reported as G&A by many of our peers. We hope this additional disclosure is helpful. Of course, practice varies in how companies classify certain operating expenses, but adjusted EBITDA and operating income metrics provide consistent comparisons across all companies. Moving now to profitability, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $241 million, up $15 million from Q3 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 36%, consistent with Q3 levels and at the high end of our guidance range. As a reminder, our Q4 EBITDA margins are compressed by roughly 2 points due to the absorption of the SOASTA and Nominum acquisitions in 2017. Once we fully integrate and scale these acquisitions into Akamai in first half of 2018, we expect to see EBITDA margins begin to expand. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $155 million, up $13 million from Q3 levels. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 23%, consistent with Q3 levels and at the high end of our guidance range. Again, once we integrate our recent acquisitions and execute the next phase of our operational efficiency actions, we expect operating margins to begin to expand through 2018. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $94 million or 14% of revenue, in line with our guidance for the quarter. Moving on to earnings, non-GAAP net income was $118 million or $0.69 of earnings per diluted share, $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range, driven primarily from the revenue overachievement. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $42 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of just over 26%. This tax rate is lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings. For the full year, the 2017 non-GAAP effective tax rate was 28%. Moving on to our GAAP earnings, there are three noteworthy items impacting our Q4 GAAP results that I'd like to provide some color on. First, we recorded a $52 million restructuring charge in Q4, and we expect to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $15 million in Q1. These charges include workforce reductions of approximately 400 employees or 5% of our total head count, as well as several facility closures. Also included are capitalized software impairments from decisions to deprioritize certain investment areas that have not achieved the commercial success and return on investment we expected, notably, in our Media Division. We already implemented some of these actions in the middle of the fourth quarter and plan to complete most of the remaining actions in the first quarter of 2018. Second, Q4 GAAP operating expenses were impacted by a $16 million charge due to the release of a foreign tax-related indemnification asset related to a 2012 acquisition. This charge is offset by a $16 million benefit to GAAP taxes, so there was zero net effect on our Q4 GAAP net income and earnings per share. Lastly, included in our GAAP taxes this quarter is a one-time provisional $26 million net charge associated with U.S. tax reform, which represents $0.15 of GAAP EPS. This charge, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results, is comprised of a $43 million charge for the deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, often referred to as the total charge (00:23:38), which is partially offset by a non-cash net benefit of $17 million related to the remeasurement of our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities because of the lower corporate tax rate. Factoring in these various GAAP-only items, GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $19 million or $0.11 of earnings per diluted share. Now I'll review our use of capital. We continue to focus on the importance of returning value to our shareholders. During the quarter, we spent $55 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1 million shares. For the year, we spent $361 million, more than 90% of our free cash flow, buying back approximately 7 million shares. And over the last five years, we have spent over $1.4 billion, approximately 77% of our free cash flow, and reduced our share count by 11 million shares. We will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy going forward, including with respect to returning capital to shareholders. In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and our momentum as we exited 2017. Before I move on to guidance, there are a few housekeeping items that I wanted to highlight. The first relates to some revenue reporting changes that we'll be making for 2018. As you know, two years ago, we aligned and consolidated our development, product management, marketing, and sales teams into three customer- centric divisions : Web Division, Media Division, and Enterprise & Carrier Division. We have streamlined further, and moving forward, we will be operating and reporting the business under a two- division structure : Web Division and Media and Carrier Division. Also, we will stop providing a solution category revenue view in 2018, because we no longer manage the business through this lens, and therefore do not believe it as a useful measure in understanding our business performance, especially with the growing overlap between some of our Media Delivery and Web Performance product portfolios. Instead, we will provide a view for Cloud Security like what we do today and consolidate the remaining solution revenue streams into a CDN other category. These new reporting views will be effective when we report our Q1 2018 results, and we will continue to provide U.S. versus international revenue, as well as revenues for our large Internet Platform Customers. The second housekeeping item relates to the new revenue accounting standard, ASC 606, which we are adopting effective Q1 2018. The new standard primarily impacts the revenue timing of a few license software customer contracts, a very small component of our revenue, and while immaterial on a full-year basis, may result in modest quarter-to-quarter revenue fluctuations. The new revenue standard also requires that we defer and amortize certain sales commission costs. It is important to note that the new accounting standard has not material impact to Akamai's historical or projected revenue and income statement. We plan to adopt ASC 606 on a full retrospective basis. So when we report our Q1 2018 financial results in April, all prior periods will be adjusted to comply with the new rules, which should be helpful to investors for comparative trending analysis. The revenue and income statement guidance I provide today is based on these new revenue accounting standard rules. Moving now to guidance, we have discussed several out of the ordinary items on today's call, including tax reform, restructuring, a new revenue standard, and 2017 acquisitions that are dilutive in the near term and that will impact our 2018 financial results. To help investors navigate the anticipated impact of these items, we are providing both Q1 guidance and some thoughts about the full year on this call. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we are projecting another solid quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We expect to see the normal sequential revenue decline due to seasonality, perhaps a bit more pronounced due to the particularly strong holiday commerce season this past quarter. We are projecting Q1 revenue in the range of $647 million to $659 million, and at the midpoint, represent the slight acceleration in year-over-year growth in constant currency. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 65%, consistent with Q4 levels. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $265 million to $270 million, roughly consistent with fourth quarter spend, as we absorb a full quarter of Nominum cost and implement our planned restructuring actions. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 36%, consistent with Q4 levels. Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $84 million to $86 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 23% for Q1, also consistent with the prior quarter. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.67 to $0.70. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $34 million to $36 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 23%, which is down five points from 2017 levels due to the impact of U.S. tax reform. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $65 million to $75 million, excluding equity compensation in the quarter. This range is lower than recent spend levels due to the timing and alignment of network CapEx purchases and planned network deployments that are expected to begin in Q2. Lastly, and as I mentioned earlier, we plan to take an additional restructuring charge of roughly $15 million, bringing our total Q4 and Q1 restructuring charges to just under $70 million. The next phase of workforce reductions will take effect in late Q1, resulting in a lower operating expense run rate heading into Q2. It is important to note these restructuring actions are being taken to enable some rebalancing of our investments, divesting in some areas, investing in others, and to position the company to meet our long-term goals of continued growth and scale. And beyond Q1, we have other efforts underway to drive additional operational efficiency so that we can redeploy spend and invest in more areas to fuel growth. These ongoing efforts should lead to growing spend more slowly than revenue growth and generating margin expansion. Looking to the full year, we are anticipating revenue of roughly $2.67 billion to $2.71 billion, with modest acceleration from the first half to the second half of the year. We anticipate EBITDA and non-GAAP operating margins to expand modestly every quarter from first quarter levels, as we implement both our restructuring actions, fully absorb our recent acquisitions, and reprioritize investments in line with our expected revenue growth. For the full year, we expect adjusted EBITDA and operating margins of 37% and 24% respectively, consistent with 2017 full-year levels, and on a trajectory of further expansion going into 2019. And at these revenue and margin levels and an expected non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23%, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.90 to $3 for full year 2018. This would be up about 13% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. As a helpful reference, we will post our Q1 and full year 2018 guidance ranges on the Investor Relations section of our website after this call. In closing, we are bullish about the opportunities ahead for Akamai. We are confident in our ability to deliver revenue, margin, and earnings expansion in 2018, while at the same time, continue our successful product and customer diversification strategies, which we believe will add significant shareholder value over both the near term and long term. Thank you. And Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Our first question is from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Really strong quarter, congratulations all around. Can you just talk about two things? One is, what are the things that have changed that have enabled you to significantly increase your EBITDA margin outlook and so you went \u2013 it looks like going down and now flat. And what are the areas that you are deep prioritizing that are behind the charge? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I'll take that, Michael. Thank you. That's a good question. I think you know, and we've talked about it throughout 2017, that one of the big areas of pressure on EBITDA margins for the company and operating margins for that matter has been the absorption of our acquisitions. And so that's been about a two-point impact on our operating margins and EBITDA margins for the last couple of quarters. And so, we're beginning to absorb SOASTA more so; Nominum, less so. We've been very much focused on driving operational efficiency across the business. And we've been clear with investors that we intend to operate the company in the high 30s EBITDA margins, and then expanding back to the low 40s going forward. And so this is very much an alignment with what we've been talking about. Now as we talked about, we took a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. We implemented some of those restructuring actions in the middle of the quarter. We're going to finish the remainder of those actions pretty much in the first quarter, and so very much in alignment with what we've been saying we're going to do. And I would say the areas that we talked about that I included in my comments, and I think Tom talked about them a little bit as well, is that primarily in the Media area or Media-related area that this is a highly innovative company. And we've been investing in R&D in a bunch of different areas. And when you do that, not all areas end up being as commercially successful as you expect them to be. And so there were some areas in the Media Division that we decided to scale back on. It's resulted in some capitalized software impairments that we're going to write off. And it's also resulted in some R&D engineers that were working in those areas to leave the business as a result of that. So, I think it's the nature of a highly innovative company. Sometimes you have products that are highly successful, and sometimes, you don't. And I think this is just \u2013 we're scaling back in areas that have not been commercially successful to date. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, (00:35:31) follow-up. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: (00:35:31). Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I'm sorry, Tom, my apologies. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No, that's right. And as Jim noted, I think going forward, you'll see in our Media Division a really intense focus on quality, scale, and the cost of video. We had a lot of projects ongoing in Media, and we've scaled several of those back so that we can focus on what we think is really important for the future of the Media business. Also in the Enterprise area, as you know, there were several projects there. Going forward, the Enterprise Division or team will be focused on Enterprise Security, capabilities like Enterprise Application Access, Enterprise Threat Protector, enabling enterprises to survive in a world of zero trust. There's other actions that we've taken. For example, we're closing some of our very small offices around the world, and we've got several efficiency-related projects underway. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. (00:36:36). Thanks very much, guys. Congratulations. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Sanderson with MKM Partners. Your line is now open. Rob J. Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks. I'll echo congratulations on the fine results. Since it will be the last time we're talking about solutions categories, I'd like to take apart some of the areas of strength, if we could. You mentioned SOASTA, Image Manager, Bot Manager as areas of new product improvements. But, I guess, how do they line up across the segments? I imagine Bot Managers in Cloud Security, and I'm really trying to dig in to more the Web Performance ex-security, a surprise there. And is it new products related? Are you seeing momentum on old products, older generations of products? Was there some impact from the custom government work that you've done in the past? Just trying to get to the source of the strength, if we could. And then second question is, Jim, you said something about in the Media segment typically being a 6-month (00:37:42) lag to improve revenue growth from when you see the traffic improvement. Could you sort of walk through the mechanics of that? I'm not sure I fully understand why there would be such a lag when you see the traffic recovery. Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Sure. So on your first question that we had tremendous growth in Security, not just in new product areas, but also in our core Security Solutions. So Security grew 31% for the quarter, which is an acceleration from what we did in the third quarter. Relative to the Performance side, as we've talked about, on the Performance side that our Web Division customers tend to buy our high-end Web Performance products, and our Media Division customers tend to buy our lower-end Web Division or Web Performance products, which are more traffic-related. These products have become somewhat interchangeable, which is one of the reasons why we're going to stop reporting it that way. The best way for you to look at kind of the performance is that the new product areas of Security, Image Manager, Bot Manager, all of them, those tend to be very heavily sold into our Web Division customer base. So when you look at our Web Division customer base growing in the mid-teens, you should think of it as buying kind of those products of the portfolio, our Performance and Security products of the portfolio, not so much our Media products. Our Media Division customers, while they do buy those products, the predominant product that they buy are our traffic products. And those traffic products could be a Media Delivery product, or those traffic products could be a Web Performance product. So we're not providing it going forward because it's just \u2013 we don't look at the business that way internally and we just don't think it provides a helpful view for investors. Obviously, during kind of Annual Investor Days, we'll give you some color on new product areas and how the new product areas are doing, so you can get an understanding of kind of some of the new areas of innovation in the company and the traction that we're making. I think your second question was related to Media, and... Rob J. Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC : Yeah. The six to nine months lag on traffic to revenue. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: The way you need to think about that is when you do a reprice with a customer, you see a reduction in the pricing of the customer right away. And it takes a while for the traffic to grow to a rate, then you eclipse that pricing reduction. And so it's a bit of math on it, that you take a \u2013 you go to a reprice, the price drops immediately, traffic does grow, but it takes a while for that traffic growth to lapse the pricing reduction. And usually it depends upon the customers. Some customers, it could be a quarter. But on average, it's about six to nine months from the time you do a contract restructure. And as we've been talking about for the last couple quarters, we began a pretty vigorous campaign around going and capturing more traffic share in our top 250 customers, and we made tremendous progress in that, and it's resulted in traffic share increases and traffic growth acceleration both in Q3 and Q4. It hasn't manifested itself yet in revenue growth, but we are quite confident going into 2018 that you're going to see the Media Division turn from, which has been down very slightly, to begin to grow modestly in the low single digits and hopefully improve throughout the year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you. Next question? Operator : Our next question is from James Breen with William Blair. Your line is now open. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple questions on the revenue side. In the Media business, you talked about redoing some contracts with some new customers. Can you just talk about how that give you some visibility into that portion of the business, which traditionally has been pretty volatile? And then secondly, in the Security and Web side, as you're offering these new products, are you seeing into your existing customers that are driving growth? Are you able to enter new markets and increase the customer count from that? Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: So on the visibility side, I mean, obviously, we knew customers all the time. Some, of course, we knew more than others. I think it's fair to say in the back half of 2017, we did more contract restructures like we said we were going to. In some cases, we opened up contracts earlier as a result of trying to grab more traffic share with those customers. And so, I think our visibility is pretty good. I think some of the changes that we've made and that Tom talked about and that we've talked about in the last couple of calls, this very, very specific focus in the top 250 customers and reorienting our sales organization to be very much oriented around the top 250 and less focused on the customers below that has given us, I think, some very good customer visibility into the business. And so I think we feel pretty good about the visibility. We feel very good about the relationships we have with these customers. We feel very good about our ability to kind of maintain that momentum. And Tom, you want to talk about the product areas? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So the Security products are great for our existing customers. A lot of them have upgraded by adding Bot Manager, for example. They're also good for attracting new customers, particularly in the financial vertical, where I would say that the strong new customer adoption there is driven by Security. And then as we look to the future with the Enterprise Security products, that opens up whole new verticals for us. So I will be selling those products in the existing base, but I think that gives us a really good chance to increase our customer base. And of course, one of the areas that we talked about we're investing this year is with new customer generation, the go-to-market efforts there. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer: Thanks, guys. I guess, two questions, maybe for Jim a little bit more. Do you think you can now keep your head count growing slower than your revenue at this point? I guess, how much operating leverage can you kind of see over the next couple years so that you'd maybe see consistent margin improvement? And secondly, any more thoughts on maybe the balance sheet on \u2013 I think of all my companies, you're about the most under-levered I have at this point, and it seems fairly suboptimal. I just don't know if you have any updates given a little bit more visibility in the business model. Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Sure. So on the head count growth, so I think you can tell from the comments that I mentioned that I think you will see head count growth grow slower than revenue growth based on some of the actions that we're talking about taking. So I think what we outlined today that you're going to see scale in the business and outside of our network cost, that in most of our costs in the company, are head count-related. And so you can expect that the margin expansion that we talked about that we're expecting to have happened through 2018 and hopefully exiting at a better rate outside of 2018 going into 2019 is going to be from better scale, and better scale in areas on G&A, we're going to continue to make sure we make the right investments in R&D and new product areas and make sure we continue to invest in areas on the sales and marketing side to capture the revenue growth opportunities. So, I'm pretty confident that we'll be able to continue to scale. And on the balance sheet, I would say that I think we've done a pretty darn good job as a company that I talked about the buyback that we've done and how much of our \u2013 we spent of our free cash flow and buying back shares for the company. Also, the cash that we have available, we put to strategic use. We bought two companies last year. We bought SOASTA, we bought Nominum. I think that's a very good use of capital for the company to invest in areas that are going to fuel future growth for the company. So, I feel pretty good about what we've done. It's certainly an area that we always look at. It's certainly an area that we talked to the Board about on an ongoing basis. So certainly, we were open to feedback in that area as always. But I think that pretty much, we put the capital that we have to use in buybacks and in areas of M&A that strategically help the company going forward. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer: Great. And then just on the guidance. Any assumptions on the FX on the guidance for this year? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, there'll be \u2013 actually, with the recent weakening of the dollar, that there will be an improvement in FX, probably several million dollars versus Q4 levels. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer: And is that in your current guidance, I guess? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes, it is. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer: Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just switching to the Security, that was a pretty strong quarter, 31% growth. Just wondering if you could give some color in terms of \u2013 if you see any particular strength on any particular product? And as a follow-up, as we look into 2018, how sustainable is this growth? And are you expecting any new products that, besides Kona and Prolexic, are you expecting any other product to get more traction or contribute significantly in 2018? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes. I mentioned Bot Manager Premier, which features the machine learning technology that we've got in part from Cyberfend, that is really doing very well. That is, right now, the one way to distinguish between humans and bots logging in to an account. And of course, the bots are being used to see if a stolen password and login is valid across thousands of websites. And a lot of folks use the same login credentials across multiple sites. In fact, most logins today for a lot of our customers are done by bots trying to crack into accounts. And the Bot Manager Premier catches that and stops it. So that's been a very exciting new product for us with a lot of runway for future growth. Also, our Enterprise products, as I mentioned, are focused around Enterprise Security. And it's very early days for those products, but there is a rich road map to further improve them. And we're excited about combining, for example, Enterprise Application Access with Kona Site Defender to protect internal enterprise applications. Kona Site Defender, of course, is the industry-leading product for application layer and DDoS defenses for our consumer applications. But you need the same capabilities now inside the firewall, and that is possible by combining EAA with Kona Site Defender. Also, we're investing in the go-to-market side, so that we'll be in a better position to sell these products, not only internally to the existing customer base, but to generate a much larger customer base. Today, our traditional products really are focused on about a third of the verticals out there in the Fortune 1000. But with the Enterprise Security product line, that \u2013 we can increase that substantially. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan: Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I wanted to drill in on the comments around the large contract renewals and your confidence in the Media Acceleration. It sounds like you've got good visibility into that acceleration. And I'm wondering, were you able to get, as part of the new agreements, a guarantee of a larger percentage of traffic and that's why you have this new increased visibility? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I mean, I think it's a combination of things. One, obviously, when you do a contract restructure, most of these contracts are at least a year long, some longer than that. And so you certainly get some good visibility from customers when you contract with them around their expectations. And almost all these contracts, as you can imagine, these customers commit to you for that period of time, and they give you some color around what they expect to do. They don't always commit to that level that they expect to deliver, because they don't want to be in a position where they're not delivering up to their commitment. But I'd say this is \u2013 what's maybe a little bit different here is that I think that our Media team have been very operationally focused on these top 250 customers. So I think the intelligence that we have with these customers at the time of renewal, and not just the intelligence but also the contract structure that we've put in place, in many cases, incent the customer to push more traffic with Akamai, because the way the contract vehicles work is the more traffic they push with us, the better pricing that they do get. And so, I think we've been smart about some contract structures to be able to secure the share and grow share with the way we price this with customers, so we feel very good and we're quite confident about being able to return the Media Division customer base back to revenue growth in 2018. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan: Okay, great. And then one follow-up, you touched on \u2013 last quarter, you guys benefited in the Media in terms of the focus with the sales force selling more Media products to Media customers. And looking at the performance upside, would you say that we just saw a normalization of those sales behaviors this quarter and that's why we got a little bit more lift in the performance side or was there something else? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Well, I think the performance lift that you got in the fourth quarter is not from the Media Division customers. The lift you got in the fourth quarter was holiday commerce traffic for our large commerce customers. There was a very, very strong holiday commerce season, and the Web Performance business benefits the most from that. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan: Perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet/Nomura: Yes, thank you, gentlemen, very much. There's been a little bit of public discussion about Elliott taking some position in the shares. And I'm just wondering if you wouldn't mind sharing with us a little bit about your thought on that, what you are in discussions with Elliott, what you can, of course, but a little bit of the nature of that back and forth will be very helpful. Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, as a matter of policy, we don't comment on discussions with specific shareholders. That said, we welcome the views of all our shareholders in how we can better create value for the shareholder base as a whole. And we've got an active dialogue with many of our shareholders to make sure that their perspectives are heard in the Board room. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet/Nomura: Okay, excellent. I guess maybe I will follow up in a different direction then and say, could you help us understand a little bit about what kind of pricing assumptions you've built into the Media business revenue picture for 2018? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I think the pricing assumptions are consistent with what we always do, which, obviously, we want to make sure that we have the competitive price points, that the way the Media business works is you got to give customers a competitive price, and then the best performance, reliability and scale wins. And so I think we've worked hard to make sure that the right pricing structure exists for our customers. And I think we're well poised to continue to grab the traffic that's there. So the Media business is all about, which is the reason why we're focusing on the top 250 customers, is focused on the customer that push a lot of traffic, put the right contract vehicles in place, and then watch the volume grow. And as the volume grows, the revenue growth should grow with that. That's just the nature of that business. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet/Nomura: Okay. So essentially, the pricing environment remains about the same. You're just grabbing a greater share of the traffic is the message? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, it's fair to say it's a very competitive pricing environment. So nothing's changed in that regard. It's still a very competitive pricing environment. So nothing's changed in that regard. But the nature of that business is about providing the right price points. And then with the right price point and the right performance, you'll get the traffic volumes. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet/Nomura: Okay, thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Our next question is from Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Your line is now open. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Yes, thank you very much. Lot of questions about the visibility in Media and I just want to dig a level deeper there. So you spoke about the top 250 customers. Can you talk to us about how many of these customers you have contacted? How many have \u2013 the contracts have been changed? Just want to kind of get a sense for the continued flow from other benefits from these sort of renewals. Secondly, if you can also touch on what are your expectations for your Platform Customers in 2018, clearly, that number seems to have stabilized around $50 million a quarter, just wanted to get your assumptions for next year. Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, certainly, from a visibility perspective in Media that we don't disclose the number of contracts that we actually reprice. But I think it's fair to say that based on what we talked to you about, at the end of Q2 and in Q3, that we were pretty aggressive about going into the customer base, where we thought that we could grab more traffic share. And you can expect that we did most of that in the second half. So I would say, most of that is behind us, to be frank that we've done a lot of that work now. And so we think we're going to be able to reap the benefits from that work in 2018. And relative to the Platform, the Internet Platform Customers, as we talked about in the past, you're right that they've been roughly $50 million a quarter throughout 2017. The dynamics that are going on with those customers are different, so not all those customers are kind of the same that \u2013 I think we can expect for those customers that they'll probably come down modestly in 2018, to be frank. They usually do, Q4 to Q1, seasonally, you see a drop in those customers. And I would expect we'll see that seasonal drop for them this quarter, and then probably stay, call it, 7% of the Akamai's revenues for pretty much the remainder of 2018. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Hart with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. There's a lot of additional color, which I really appreciate, especially the comments about Image Manager, Bot Manager, and SOASTA reaching $100 million run rate. I wanted to dive in a little bit around CapEx. I know you guided to only spending about 10% to 12% of revenue in 1Q, but there's more coming in the second quarter around the network refresh cycle. I was wondering if you could maybe give a little color kind of where we should think about the CapEx spending over the full year 2018 and maybe longer term. And has your thinking around the level of capital intensity been changed at all by the lower tax rate? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. No, I mean, it's probably important to remind folks that our CapEx really are two big areas and then a smaller area. One is network CapEx and the other is capitalized software. So we spend, call it, between 15% and 17% of our revenue in network CapEx and capitalized software with a little bit in facilities. And so, call it, half of it is in network CapEx and roughly half of it would be capitalized software. And so capitalized software are all the new product area that Tom talked about, Image Manager, Bot Manager, et cetera, that's all the new product innovation that's going on. So, it's not typical CapEx like many people think of it. It's not physical CapEx in that regard. And relative to network CapEx, I think we've done a nice job of scaling our network CapEx. And you can expect that we'll continue to scale our network CapEx in 2018. There's always a lot of initiatives underway in the company around driving cost of goods sold efficiencies and CapEx efficiencies in the company. And so for the full year, we'll probably spend on CapEx again between 15% and 17% of revenue. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray : Hey, good afternoon. I just had a question related to getting a sense for where the bulk of Security growth can come from going forward. So, as it stands today, is the growth with Security coming more from higher revenue per customer for existing Security customers? Or is it through adding new customers? And I'm sure the answer is some of both. But which would you say is driving more of the growth right now? And then also related to that, what percent of Security customers today are outside of your customer base for other Akamai solutions? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I would say most of the dollars today is upsell into the existing customer base, but we are also attracting new customers, and I mentioned, especially in the financial vertical, where the first product they buy will be Security. Today, you take the typical Web-wrap (00:59:59) out there selling, and most of the new deals are led by Security. So it's really good as an upsell when we have these new products and really good to attract new customers, and especially, as we start getting traction with our Enterprise Security products, because those appeal to every enterprise, where our traditional product lines, as I mentioned, were more combined to about a third of the verticals in the Fortune 1000. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray : All right, thanks. And then a quick housekeeping, are you expecting the fiscal 2018 tax rate to be similar to the 23% non-GAAP rate in Q1? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes. I think I provided that in the full-year guidance. We expect a 23% full-year non-GAAP tax rate. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, hi. Most of mine have been answered, but one that I just wanted to touch on. You've talked about pricing in the Media business. And I believe you said you expect the pricing trends that you've been seeing to continue. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you've been seeing over the last kind of 6 to 12 months in the Performance business and how are you thinking about pricing trends as you look ahead over the next 12 months? Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Sure. I'd say the Performance business that you can expect, Heather, that is also \u2013 it's not competitive like Media, but it's also a competitive business that Akamai has, we believe, the best performing set of products in that area. And so it depends upon the customer that you're selling to for the Web Performance, but not all customers and not all products are the same. And so when you're selling a Web Performance product maybe to a Media customer that's using it for a traffic solution, pricing might be much more aggressive, whereas if you're maybe selling Web Performance Solution to a large commerce customer that really needs to have the highest level of performance and reliability. And so, the pricing trends kind of differ by those customers. But as you can imagine, every customer, when they come up for renewal, they expect the price of technology to come down; the Web Performance product category is no different than that. But I'd say, it's a competitive area. It's not as competitive as Media, but it's certainly a competitive area, and it depends upon the customer profile. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then just a follow-up, if I may. The multi-sourcing that has happened in the Media business over the last couple of years, have you seen that start to happen in the Performance business in some of the customer segments? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I think only in the low end. As Jim mentioned, where it's just basic delivery, you can see some there. But for a commerce company or a bank or anything like that, it doesn't technically make really sense to do multi-sourcing. If you're just sending out DOM objects, you could do multi-sourcing there. But when you're protecting or accelerating an app or a whole site, you don't tend to see that. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co: Great. Thank you. Two questions, if I may. The first one is part of the review process that the company seems to have initiated sometime in the fourth quarter, are you considering or evaluating an outright sale of the entire company? And then secondly, as it relates to M&A, you've historically focused on technology bolt-ons or tuck-ins. Is there an increasing focus to look at companies that had more of a go-to-market benefit for Akamai? It seems like you have really great products, but part of what you're lacking is the go-to-market to get into some of these institutions, and I'm wondering if that's something we could potentially see more of in 2018. Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yes, so of course, we don't comment on rumors. And so I'm not going to say anything there. Of course, our board always operates in the best interest of shareholders. We have a very professional and experienced board. In terms of your second question, yeah, as I talked about, we are investing in growing our go-to-market efforts, particularly around new customers and especially for the new Security products that we've talked about. So there is increased investment there. With M&A, I don't see that there's a fundamental change in our strategy in terms of the companies that we might buy going forward. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I think it's fair to say though, Tom, on the M&A front, Colby, that you're right. We have largely acquired companies with technology capabilities. But there were companies, Prolexic being one that did have go-to-market capabilities. So we've done both before. And you can expect in our M&A aspirations that we also look at companies in the M&A realm that can help us on the go-to-market side. But it has to be the right fit for the company, and it has to be the right kind of price point. But you can expect that we're looking at all those things. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Yeah, good afternoon. My question is around the U.S. and the overseas operations Tom, and Jim, please join in as well, which is you're seeing strength in your international business versus U.S. Is the overseas strength sustainable? What's driving that? And anything you can do in terms of taking the overseas sales playbook and apply it back into the U.S.? Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No, it's a good question. As you can imagine, these large Internet Platform Customers reside in the U.S. And so they obviously weigh heavily on the U.S. growth rates. And so one of the reasons why you see lower growth rates in the U.S. than outside the U.S. is largely because of them. Having said that, I think you're absolutely right that we've had very good success in our international markets and in our Asia-Pacific market in particular. And it's always things that our sales leaders are sharing with one another around plays that they've run that have been successful in their particular geography that potentially could work in the U.S., and there's (01:06:32) U.S. play that work \u2013 have worked well in Asia. So, yes, we're doing that. But you have to be a little bit careful that it's not necessarily because international is growing faster than the U.S. that it's a matter of the U.S. sales force. It's really a matter of that's where the big Platform Customers reside. And if you pull them out, actually, the growth rates in the Americas are pretty good. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Dylan Haber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Dylan Haber - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong quarter. Following up on the last question on international, in terms of the strength you saw in APAC, which markets drove that outperformance? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. We've had strong growth in actually many other markets. We've had drawn strong growth in Australia. We've had strong growth in Japan. We've had strong growth in Singapore. So it's been pretty pervasive that we've had very good adoption of our technology in the Asia-Pacific market, both in the Media customer base and in the Web customer base. So, we're quite pleased with the execution in the Asia-Pacific market. I mean, I think the other markets are doing well. I think the \u2013 EMEA is also a market that's done pretty well. I think we called out Asia-Pacific because notably their growth rate is a little bit more. But we actually had a very good year in 2017 in our European markets as well. Dylan Haber - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Will Power with Baird. Your line is now open. Unknown Speaker : Hey, this is actually Charlie (01:08:11) on for Will. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the OTT impacts in the quarter and maybe specifically DIRECTV NOW, which has been growing subscribers at a healthy clip, how impactful was DIRECTV NOW specifically in the quarter? And maybe more generally, how should we think about OTT growth going forward in 2018? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I mean, I can start and maybe Tom can offer any other color. As Tom commented on his prepared remarks that we had very strong growth in OTT with roughly 50% traffic growth with our video delivery customers, and so that's by far the fastest growing traffic area for our Media business. And we expect to continue to grow at a strong clip. We don't comment specifically on customers, AT&T or DIRECTV NOW, other than to say that, obviously, they are customers and we have a good business relationship with them. But we really can't comment on specifically anything more noteworthy and relative to the broader trends. I think as Tom talked about that \u2013 we think OTT will continue to have continued, steady strong traffic growth rates in the near term. I think we believe as a company that longer term, there's a huge amount of traffic that's poised to move online. I don't think that's going to be the case in the 2018 fiscal year. I think you'll see steady growth in OTT, but it's a very large, long-term growth opportunity. Unknown Speaker : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse : Wow, thanks very much for fitting me in, and congrats, guys, on a wonderful performance in Q4. My question for you, Jim, I appreciate that you mentioned in your remarks that the impact from ASC 606 wouldn't be material. But can you bridge us from ASC 606 guidance back to ASC 605 for comparison with Street models? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, it \u2013 literally, Brad, it's handfuls of millions of dollars that one of the reasons we have not provided what I wanted to be able to provide to you guys is an ability to give you a historical restatement of 2017, we have to get our auditors through that before we publish that. But it's very immaterial, Brad. It's \u2013 call it, it's less than 0.5% of revenue for the company. And it doesn't always go in one direction or the other. And so it's handfuls of millions of dollars in the first quarter and not really a notable impact, which is \u2013 I wanted to bring it up because I wanted you guys to know that it's coming. I also wanted to make sure you realize that it's not a material impact from the company's revenue or P&L results for either the quarter or the year. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse : So the commission expense, by deferring it, doesn't end up being a benefit? Do you factor that in... James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse : ...or have an assumption baked into your guidance for it? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No, we do. But again, it's not material. Because all that \u2013 not all of our commission spend is subject to the amortization. It's only the portion of our commission spend that is related to bookings. So our sales teams have revenue plans and they have bookings plans. And a heavy weighting of their commission plans is on revenue and sales reps that are on a revenue plan. The ASC 606 does not affect revenue plan. It only affects bookings-oriented plans. So it's a smaller percentage of our commission spend that's impacted by it. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse : Excellent. Very helpful (01:11:49). Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Operator, I think we have \u2013 yeah, sorry about that, Brad. So, operator, we have time for, I think, two more questions. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay, great. I'll try to be brief with these two quick ones. Just you talked about the bit growth, referenced the fact that you've outperformed the market. Can you just be specific what did you see as the bit growth for the market, Q3, Q4? And any quantification you can give on share gains? So that's question one. And then question two, with respect to Enterprise in particular, the go-to-market. You talked about the broader applicability of the products that was referenced to a lot of vertical markets that you might not have addressed previously. Does that suggest more material changes to go-to-market and sales structure going into the year? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Okay. So the published estimates of traffic growth on the Internet are around the mid-20s overall and they get into the 30s for video. So we compare quite favorably to that. In terms of the go-to-market, we do operate a overlay specialist team for the new Enterprise products. And that's an area that we'll be growing and looking at carefully as we head further into 2018. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Thank you. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Okay. Operator, we've time for one more. Operator : Our last question is from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question, guys, and squeezing me in. I was hoping that you guys could comment on what looked to be competitive products to some of your core services. The first is Google Project AMP, and the second is AWS Lambda@Edge. And I'm just wondering, do you view these products as competing solutions to any of your core services? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Well, we have lots of competitors, including the major cloud service providers. So there's just a ton of competition out there. And we distinguish ourselves with the \u2013 our performance, our scale, our reliability, and our security. But there's \u2013 I think we track about 90 competitors across our various product lines. Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And I guess, if I could just follow up. On the Enterprise launch, I guess, what gives you guys some of the confidence that you have in launching the Enterprise-type securities? It looks like Enterprise Application Access seems to be at least copied by at least one other competitor. It looks like Cloudflare put out a competing product in the quarter. So I was wondering if you could comment on that, too. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Enterprise Security is going to have a lot of players. You have all the existing companies that sell data center-based security devices that'll be looking to move into the cloud. You have some of the CDNs with some capabilities that are trying to, I would say, try to have some offers there. I think Akamai is really unique. And you look at our capabilities with Kona Site Defender, the massive scale we offer, the massive amount of data we have to be able to understand what's an attack, what's a human, what's a bot, what are the bad entities, we see a large fraction of all the transactions on the Internet. So we have a very good view as to which devices and which entities are doing bad things and which are normal users. And that's stuff that \u2013 capabilities that Akamai uniquely has, because other companies don't have access to that traffic. So we're in a very good position to know what's good and what's not. And with Enterprise Application Access, the ability to marry that with Kona Site Defender gives incredible security for internal applications, does it very efficiently, at scale, very reliably, and doesn't impact your performance. So I think it's a very compelling and unique offer in the marketplace. Now that said, it's a huge market, and there'll be a lot of players out there trying to grab a share of it. Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Tom. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Okay, well, thank you... Operator : (01:16:06)... Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: ...okay, and so I'll just pick it up, operator. Thank you. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. In closing, we'll be presenting at several investor conferences in February and March. Details of these can be found on our Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Additionally, we are currently planning for our annual Investor Summit. As you know, we face some disruption to travel and attendance due to weather issues in March over the past few years. And we're looking to hold it a little bit later in the year. And when we set a specific date, we will let you know. So thank you all for joining us and have a wonderful evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Riley FBR Tim Horan - Oppenheimer James Breen - William Blair Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Michael Turits - Raymond James Jeff Kvaal - Nomura Instinet Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Will Power - Robert Baird Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Akamai Technologies Inc. First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And I would now like introduce your host for today's program, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tom Barth : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on April 30, 2018. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Thomson Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the first quarter. Revenue was at record $669 million, up 11% over Q1 of last year. With strong performance across all sectors of the business. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.79 per diluted share, up 22% year-over-year. This very strong result was driven by the acceleration in our revenue growth rate, the impact of the cost reductions that we made in the fourth quarter of last year and a lower tax rate. EBITDA margins in Q1 improved to 38% and non-GAAP operating margins were 25%. We expect further improvements in margins by the end of the year impart because of the additional cost reduction actions that we took in Q1. And we're continuing our work to find a path to achieve non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while also continuing to invest in the development of new products to fuel our future growth.  Our security portfolio was again the fastest growing part of our business in Q1, with revenue of $149 million, up 36% over Q1 of last year. The strong growth of our security business was driven by our market leading Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Solutions, as well as our new Bot Manager Premier and Nominum Services. Each of these solutions has proven to be highly effective against some very large and sophisticated cyber-attacks. For example in February, we used our Prolexic Solutions to defend one of our customers against what we believe to be the largest DDoS attack ever recorded deflecting more than 1.3 terabits per second of attack traffic. It's always hard to comprehend numbers this big. But to put it into context, 1.3 terabits per second of attack traffic is enough to overwhelm most data centers and internet service providers. And even many countries internet connections to the rest of the world. It's also more than double the amount of traffic we saw from Mirai IoT botnet attacks in late 2016. In another example, a few weeks ago, we used our Bot Manager Premier and Kona Site Defender Solutions to defend a large ecommerce customer against one of the most sophisticated bot attacks that we've ever seen. In this case the attacker was attempting to buy out the site's entire inventory during a promotional sales event. So that they could later resale the merchandise at a higher price on the gray market. The attacker deployed a very large botnet to generate 800,000 transactions per minute more than 100 times normal. But Akamai was able to accurately detect and filter out the malicious transaction request and only allow legitimate users into the site to buy the merchandize. Bot Manager Premier uses sophisticated AI and machine learning technology to analyze the motions and actions on the requesting device in order to distinguish between human neuromuscular signatures and machine generated requests. This technology is especially effective in floating bots that are trying to take over end user accounts. At the recent RSA conference in San Francisco, a leader at one of the world's largest financial institutions told me that when they deployed Bot Manager Premier, the number of their accounts that were compromised by bots dropped from over 8,000 per month to just 1 or 2 per month, that's not 1,000 or 2,000 per month it's now literally just 1 or 2 compromised accounts per month. And that resulted in tens of millions of dollars in direct annual savings due to the decrease in fraud. As you might imagine they are a very happy Akamai customer. It's because of such impactful capabilities that the financial services industry is one of our largest and fastest growing verticals. Probably over 500 financial institutions that we service over 400 use our security solutions, including all top 25 U.S. banks and 22 of the top 25 in Europe. Another key differentiator of our security solutions is the enormous volume of data that we see on our platform. By analyzing and processing this data with advanced AI and machine learning algorithms, we can quickly identify malicious entities and then use that information to protect our customers from a wide variety of attacks. For example, with the addition of Nominum, we now process 1.7 trillion domain name system or DNS queries per day for over 100 million domains. The DNS name space evolves quite rapidly, especially for domain that are associated with botnets and other malicious activity. On a typical day, we identify 5 million new core domains, many of which turn out to be malicious and we block access to over 1 million malicious domain every day. Thereby helping to keeping our customers and their end users safe. Our suite of security solutions was an important contributor to the revenue on our web division. In Q1 web division customers generated $353 million in revenue, up 16% over Q1 of last year. Web division revenue was also driven by the continued success of our flagship Buyon [ph] Solution, along with our new Image Manager and Digital Performance Management Solutions.  Across the company, we now have 1,000 customers using our new solutions. The revenue from these solutions in Q1 was more than triple the revenue from Q1 of last year and is now on a run rate of well over $100 million per year. Revenue for our Media and Carrier Division in Q1 was $316 million, up 6% over Q1 of last year. This much improved result is the consequence of the work we have been doing to improve our traffic share in the top 250 global media accounts. In fact traffic growth on the Akamai platform overall in Q1 accelerated over the already high rates that we saw in the second half of last year and it remains well beyond reported industry norms. The traffic growth in Q1 was especially strong in our OTT and gaming sectors. Akamai has delivered several notable sporting events so far in 2018, including most all of the major sporting events online. In one of the most exciting Akamai set a record for concurrent views of a sporting event with our delivery of the Indian Premier Leagues Cricket match on April 25th. As the exclusive CDN for Hotstar, India\u2019s largest premium streaming platform. We delivered video to nearly 7 million concurrent viewers, 98% of whom were using mobile devices and 89% of whom connected through a cellular network. We believe this is the model for the future, media companies relying on Akamai for secured delivery of high quality video streams to many millions and someday potentially billions of mobile devices around the world. In summary, I am very pleased with our Q1 results, it was great to see the continued very strong performance of our security business, which now has a revenue run rate of $600 million per year. The much improved performance and growth of our Media and Carrier Division, the acceleration in revenue growth for the company overall, the improvement in margins and the very strong growth in the bottom-line. As I look to the future, I believe that Akamai has tremendous potential and that we\u2019re well positioned to capitalize on significant market opportunities in areas such as cloud security, mobile and web performance management, OTT video streaming and the internet of things. We are continuing to invest in innovation and new capabilities to drive future revenue growth, while also having the discipline to effectively manage costs and our effort to further expand margins and profitability. We believe that our unique technology, unparalleled edge platform, strong relationships with the world\u2019s carriers and major enterprises, highly talented and hardworking employee base, strong corporate culture and our relentless and personalized attention to customers and partners all provide Akamai with a foundation for a very bright future that creates value for our shareholders, customers and employees. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim, to review our financials and guidance for the year. Jim? James Benson : Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the highlights of our Q1 results, I want to start with three quick financial housekeeping reminders. First, as I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard ASC 606 effective Q1, 2018. We adopted ASC 606 on a full retrospective basis. So on today's financial results, all prior periods comply with the new rules. And we told you in February, the new accounting standard dose not materially impact Akamai\u2019s historical or projected revenue and income statement. And for clarity on the modest impact of the changes, we've provided detailed reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of the Akamai website.  The new standard primarily impacts revenue timing of a few license software customer contracts, a very small component of our revenue. And while immaterial on a full-year basis, the new standard may result in modest quarter-to-quarter revenue fluctuations. The new revenue standard also requires us to defer and amortize certain sales commission costs. And as I mentioned on our last call, our Q1 and full year 2018 guidance projections reflected the impact of the new revenue standard. The second housekeeping item pertain to some detailed revenue reporting disclosures. As we outlined in the last call, we are now reporting revenue under a two division customer-centric structure, Web Division and Media and Carrier Division. This divisional dimension is the primary lens through which we drive and report the business. Finally, as we also told you in February, we will no longer be providing a solution category revenue view, because we no longer believe it is the useful measure in understanding our business performance. Especially with the growing overlap between some of our media delivery and web performance product portfolios. We will provide additional visibility into areas of our business that we believe are important to understand as key drivers of our future growth, which is why, we will continue to breakout our Cloud Security Solutions. Now, on to our strong Q1 results. As Tom outlined Akamai had a tremendous first quarter, exceeding the high-end of our guidance on revenues, operating margins and earnings. Q1 revenue came in well above the high-end of our guidance range at $669 million, up 11% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. And up 11% in constant currency if you exclude the six large internet platform customers, an acceleration over Q4 levels. Revenue growth was strong across the business. With the primary overachievement compared to guidance driven by higher media traffic volumes than we anticipated going into the quarter. We also continue to see rapid growth of our security products across both divisions. Revenue from our Web Division customers was $353 million, up 16% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency. We remained pleased with the strong growth in this division and the expanded product and customer revenue diversification across the company. And our Web Division customers now represent roughly 53% of Akamai's overall revenue. Within our Web Division, we continue to see strong uptake in our new product areas, namely Image Manager, Digital Performance Management and Bot Manager, as well as continued strong growth in our core Kona and Prolexic Cloud Security Solutions.  First quarter revenue for total Cloud Security Solutions was $149 million, up 36% year-over-year or 32% in constant currency. Another tremendous quarter of revenue growth and customer adoption of our Cloud Security Solutions globally. Entering the second quarter, our rapidly growing cloud security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of over $600 million and represents over 22% of our total revenues. As Tom mentioned, we believe security presents a tremendous growth opportunity for us and we plan to continue to invest in this area with a focus on further enhancing our product portfolio and extending our go-to-market capabilities. Moving now to our Media and Carrier Division, revenue for this set of customers was $316 million in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. And up a healthy 8% in constant currency excluding the large Internet Platform Customers. Revenue from the Internet Platform Customers was down from Q4 levels as expected, while revenue and traffic volumes in the rest of the division was strong across all geographies and industry verticals and significantly exceeds our expectations in the quarter. Traffic growth accelerated for the third straight quarter and was particularly robust from our video delivery and gaming customers. And as Tom noted, we also had a number of notable sporty events in the quarter that contributed to the strong traffic and revenue growth, each event with record breaking online audiences. As we\u2019ve highlights on the last several calls, our Media and Carrier division management team has been focused on capturing more traffic share and improving the quality of delivery for the top 250 media customers that account for most of our traffic and revenue. Because of these efforts, traffic growth accelerated and exceeded market growth rates in Q3, Q4 and Q1 and we are now beginning to see the associated revenue acceleration. Moving onto our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 37% of total revenue in Q1, up 2 points from Q4 levels. International revenue was $245 million in the first quarter, up 22% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia Pacific region. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $17 million on a year-over-year basis and $7 million on a sequential basis. Revenue from our U.S. market was $423 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 9% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers, an acceleration from Q4 levels in our Media Division notably. Moving onto costs, cash gross margin was 77% consistent with Q4 levels and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 65% consistent Q4 levels and also in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $258 million, down $2 million from Q4 levels and about $7 million below our guidance, probably due to higher software capitalization rates and partly due to early traction from our operational efficiency efforts. It is notable that we reduced operating expenses in the quarter, while at the same time absorbing the full quarter impact of the recent Nominum acquisition. Moving now to profitability, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $256 million, up $11 million from Q4 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 38%, an improvement of 1 point from Q4 levels and 2 points above our guidance range, primarily due to strong revenue achievement and the accelerated traction in operational efficiency I just mentioned. Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $167 million, up $8 million from Q4 levels. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 25%, up 1 point from Q4 levels and 2 points above our guidance range. As our margin expansion in Q1 highlights our efficiency efforts have already positively impacted the P&L and we are working hard to drive further operating margin improvements. Capital expenditures in Q1 excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $76 million or 11% of revenue. This was $6 million above our guidance for the quarter, due to higher capitalized engineering expenses and the acceleration of some network build out, given the stronger than expected traffic volumes. Moving onto earnings, non-GAAP net income was $136 million or $0.79 of earnings per diluted share, $0.9 above the high end of our guidance range and driven by the combination of revenue performance, reduced operating expenses and a lower tax rate. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $35 million, based on a Q1 effective tax rate of 21%. This tax rate is a couple of points lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings. Moving onto our GAAP earnings, there were a few large and noteworthy items excluded from our non-GAAP results, but impacting our Q1 GAAP results that I would like to provide some color on. First, as we highlighted in our last call, we recorded an additional $15 million restructuring charge in Q1, bringing our total Q4 and Q1 restructuring charges to $66 million. These charges are related to headcount reductions, facility closures and capitalized software impairments and resulted from decisions to reprioritize certain investment areas that have not achieved the commercial success and return on investment we expected, notably in our Media and Carrier Division. We implemented some of these actions in the middle of the fourth quarter and completed most of the remaining actions in the first quarter. It is important to note these restructuring actions were taken to enables from rebalancing of our investments, divesting in some areas, investing in others, with a goal of positioning the company to meet our long-term objectives of continued growth and scale. The second noteworthy item, impacting our Q1 GAAP results was the decision to settle the long standing legal disputes with Limelight. The terms of the settlement include a roughly $15 million settlement fee paid over five quarterly installments, but recorded in full within our Q1 results. This settlement allow us to finally put these disputes and the associated costs and distraction behind us and instead focus most of our efforts on the strategic priorities in the business. The last item impacting our Q1 GAAP results were some one-time financial and legal advisory services, related to the initiatives associated with our recent collaboration with one of our largest shareholders. Factoring in these various GAAP only items, GAAP net income for the first quarter was $54 million or $0.31 of earnings per diluted share. Now I\u2019ll review our use of capital. We continue to focus on the importance of returning capital to our shareholders. During the quarter we spent $20 million in share repurchases, buying back roughly 300,000 shares. And just last month, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our current share repurchase authorization to $750 million, which we plan to utilize by the end of 2018. Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, beyond 2018 we intend to continue our share repurchase plan to offset solution from equity compensation plans and at times to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market condition. As always our overall aims to deploy our capital to achieve favorable return to our investors in a manner that we believe is in the long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. In summary, we are extremely pleased with the revenue acceleration and margin expansion we delivered in Q1 and our momentum exiting the quarter. Moving now to guidance. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we are projecting another strong quarter on the top and bottom lines. We do expect some currency headwinds from the recent strengthening of the U.S dollar over the last couple of weeks. At current spot rates foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q2 revenue of just over $2 million compared to Q1 levels. Coming off a very strong first quarter for Media, from several large gaming releases and sporting events, combined with the foreign exchange headwinds, we are projecting Q2 revenue in the range of $658 million to $670 million. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 65%, consistent with Q1 levels. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $249 million to $254 million, down from first quarter levels as we see the full quarter benefits from our Q1 operational efficiency and restructuring actions. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of 39%, a 1 point increase from Q1 levels. Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $89 million to $92 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 25% to 26% for Q2, an increase of roughly 1 point from Q1 level. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.79 to $0.83. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of roughly $35 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 20% to 21%. This guidance also reflect a fully diluted share count of just over 172 million shares. On CapEx we expect to spend approximately $111 million to $116 million excluding equity compensation in the quarter. This spend is up over Q1 levels, as we expand our network capacity to support the traffic growth that we were expecting on the platform. Looking to the full year, we are anticipating revenue of $2.69 billion to $2.72 billion and at the midpoint an increase of $20 million from our prior outlook. At these revenue levels, we anticipate EBITDA and non-GAAP operating margins of 39% and 25% respectively, an increase of 2 points from our prior outlook, driven by the revenue achievement and accelerated traction in our operational efficiency initiatives. Factoring in these revenue and margin levels and an expected non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20% to 21%, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.15 to $3.25 for full year 2018 and at the midpoint an increase of $0.25 from our prior outlook. As a helpful reference, we will post our Q2 and full year 2018 guidance ranges on the Investor Relations section of our website after this call. In closing, we are very bullish about the opportunities ahead for Akamai. We are confident in our ability to continue to innovate and add new capabilities to drive future revenue growth. While at the same time drive margin and earning expansion in 2018 and beyond, which we believe will add significant shareholder value over both the near-term and long-term. We will be hosting our Annual Analyst Day on June 26th, at the Boston Cambridge Marriott Hotel. And we look forward to sharing more details about our business strategy, market opportunities, product vision and our work to find a path to achieving non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while also continuing to invest in the development of new products and capabilities to fuel our future growth. If you can\u2019t join us live that will be webcast by the Akamai platform. Thank you and Tom and I\u2019d take your questions. Operator? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please? Mark Mahaney : Okay, great. Thanks. Just two numbers questions, please. At international growth rate adjusted of 14% that\u2019s solid, but that does show this deceleration over the last two years, I think on an adjusted basis like-for-like basis. So any color there on expectations going forward, were there any unusual items that may have depressed that growth rate? Any way to think about that going forward as to the international side. And then the other numbers question has to do with this revenue from the internet platform customers of about $44 million. There may have been an expectations in the market that that would stabilize around $50 million, you want to talk about if that\u2019s stabilizing currently around these levels as a way to think about what that looks like over the next year or two? Thank you very much. James Benson : Sure, Mark. So the first on our international growth. I think we're pretty pleased with the international growth of 14%. You are right that that is lower than we saw on 2017. If you look at Q1 of 2017, we had very strong growth rates in Q1 of 2017 of 21%. So this is coming off of a difficult compare. But we expect that our international growth rates to remain kind of in the mid-teens growth rate. So I think we're pleased with international growth, there is nothing notable to comment there. I think we have strong growth in Asia Pacific. We\u2019ve had steady growth in our European markets as well and we expect that to continue. And relative to the internet platform customers. You're right, last year, they were roughly $50 million a quarter. But if you recall, from Q4, 2016 to Q1 of 2017 they declined about $8 million. So they do normally decline sequentially from Q4 to Q1. And so declining from roughly $50 million in Q4 to $44 million was in line with our expectations. And we would expect that they'll probably hover in kind of the low and mid-40s throughout 2018. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your question please? Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. I guess one top-line question and one kind of expense question. On the top-line, it sounds like you guys have really seen the volumes around OTT picking up and very strong and different growing Media traffic ahead of our expectations. Can you talk to us a little bit about the pricing side of the equation on how those kind of negotiations are taking place and sort of where pricing is firming out? And then on the OpEx side, it sounds like we're most of the way through -- if I'm hearing it hearing most of the way through of executing the restructuring that you guys talked about in Q4 and into Q1. Am I thinking about that right if that\u2019s sort of most of the actions have already been taken. And if you can give us a little bit more detail in terms of where were you able to find sort of good expense reduction that weren't going to be impactful? And more areas like distribution off the table, do you -- are you comfortable that you saw the same kind of distribution capacity going into some of these newer markets? James Benson : Sure, let me take that. So your first question around the pricing environment in the Media business. As we\u2019ve said for long time the pricing environment in the Media business remains very competitive, so that hasn't changed. It hasn\u2019t gotten kind of worse or better it's just a very, very competitive pricing environment with alternatives that are out there. And as we mentioned that last year, we saw traffic growth slowing in the first half of 2017 we\u2019ve put a very consorted effort in place to go and drive strong traffic growth and work with customers to tuning contract structures and some of that was through a re-price and some of that was through just a more creative contract vehicle with them to drive more traffic share. And we specifically signaled that at times it takes six to nine months from traffic growth accelerating to seeing revenue acceleration. And so what you saw in Q1 was exactly what we said was going to happen, which was we saw a traffic growth accelerate in Q3 and Q4 and now we're seeing the manifestation of that effort in revenue growth. So we feel pretty good about the progress that we're making in the Media Division. And relative to OpEx, yes we took most of the actions were taken in Q4 and we finished the remaining actions or most of the remaining actions in Q1. But I wouldn't say that that is the end of our operational efficiency efforts that I would say that's the beginning of some of our efficiency efforts there is areas that we're going to drive that I will provide a little bit the more clarity on the upcoming Analysts Day and some of those include continued reductions in facilities. And then there is some areas that we are going to drive around third party vendor savings and then just driving broader efficiency actions in different areas of the business that we have talked about that we've always done a good job of driving costs out of the network we'll continue to do that. So what you'll hear from me in June is I will outline kind of some of our ideas around what's the work we think we can drive to try to find a path back to operating margins of 30% and obviously it\u2019s going to be a glide path. But I would say we're very, very pleased with the traction that we made in Q1 you saw margin expansion, we haven't seen margin expansion for many quarters. We are guiding to have margin expansion happen in Q2 and margin expansion for the full year. So we are pretty pleased with the progress that we're making both from a top-line and on efficiency to drive margin expansion. Keith Weiss : Excellent, Thank you Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Your question please. Michael Olson : Hey, good afternoon. I had two questions if I could, on the first one, I wanted to ask another on OTT maybe just slightly different from the previous question essentially is the OTT inflection point really starting to show itself now for Akamai\u2019s Media business or is it kind of still early days for OTT?  And then second, with a more favorable environment for use of international cash, et cetera do you see Akamai getting more aggressive on the M&A front? And if so I'm sure you can't say specifically, but what kinds of add-ons from a high level could we expect you to be looking at? Thanks. Thomson Leighton : Yes, I don't think we've seen a huge inflection points in OTT traffic, I think there is strong and steady growth and as we talked about, we are certainly growing our market share there. We are growing at a much faster rate in terms of the traffic and that's impart because of the focus of the top 250 media customers impart because of the quality levels, we can deliver or impart because of our unique scale. So there is a lot of reasons for that, but I'd say it\u2019s early days compared to where this can ultimately go.  In terms of M&A I will let Jim talk about the cash, but our approach to M&A I think is the same as it's been. We're interested in companies that have technology that we can embed in our platform, bring to bear for the benefit of our customers, may be an important product adjacency, for example Prolexic, Cyberfend is another example there. So the kinds of things that we've been doing in M&A I think is what you'd see us continue to do in the future and Jim would you like to talk about cash? James Benson : Yes, I mean, we have $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet, we're a significant generator of free cash flow. So we have a strong balance sheet and a cash flow to be able to do M&A and you\u2019ve seen us do that. And as Tom said that those are areas we're going to continue to look at. And as far as our cash profile most of our cash is in the U.S. And so we're not in a fit position, where we have to repatriate a bunch of cash that\u2019s sitting offshore. Most of our cash is actually in the U.S. I think we have roughly $200 million of cash offshore. So we're in a good position to continue to execute against the priorities of the business and M&A is certainly an area that we're going to be active in looking. And as we've seen and we have told you in the past we are active shoppers but disciplined buyers. We did two acquisitions in 2017 both product adjacency areas or one very much a product adjacency area and one kind of somewhat in our sweet spot with recursive DNS, but improving our security capability. So, you should expect that we're going to be continue to be active there. Michael Olson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Vijay Bhagavath : Good afternoon, congratulations again from my end. My question to you Tom is, you do have live events that kind of perturb traffic mix and also growth rates as you know and then. So even if you look at the current results, how would you pass live versus non-live? And when I'm coming from is this helps us understand the sustainable growth rate in media delivery with or without live event? Thank you. Thomson Leighton : Well, as we talked about before, live events when you have a lot of them can be helpful in boosting overall revenue, but the majority of OTT traffic and revenue is on demand and linear as a component there as well. So, live events are exciting, you see a lot of new technology there, you see the new traffic records take place there. They\u2019re very important to a lot of the big media companies, they generally trying Akamai there because of the scale and the quality in our help getting a really good event to take place. But the lion share of the revenue is the day-to-day, the video on demand. And that\u2019s an area we put a lot of effort into as well. Vijay Bhagavath : And my quick follow on would be on Enterprise Security, $100 million of Enterprise Security revenue, just for example, the reasonable target in terms of modeling. How would you look at enterprise security as contributing to your overall security business? Thank you. Thomson Leighton : Well, as we talked about it's early days for our Enterprise Security products, their Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector. We think there is a very bright future for enterprise security offerings and for success it will be well beyond $100 million in revenue. We now are up to 100 customers, so very early days there. Very pleased to see the traction that our roadmap and viewpoint is having with customers around the notions of zero plus and future of enterprise networking and security. But still early days there, but optimistic in terms of the future. Vijay Bhagavath : Perfect, congratulations again. Thomson Leighton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Siti Panigrahi : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just on the security side, that's pretty strong accelerate to 36%. Just wondering, how much was the contribution from Nominum in this quarter? And also when do you expect some kind of meaningful contribution from products like Enterprise Application Access, I mean the -- and Bot Manager? Or also like how much was the contribution from the Bot Manager? Just trying to understand the Prolexic and Kona versus the newer product contribution? James Benson : Yes, we continue to have strong growth in call the core security business kind of excluding Nominum that we've been growing that in the high 20s and you kind of have a similar growth rate this quarter. Nominum was about $10 million I think of revenue in the quarter, we had a good Nominum quarter. So, Nominum was certainly a contributor. But as Tom has talk about that, we're doing well in security across all of the product categories. So, we're doing well with Kona Site Defender, we're doing well with Prolexic and we're doing particularly well on some of the new product areas Bot Manager being one, Tom talked about it in the last call, talked about it again now that Bot Manager actually is becoming a meaningful contributor for revenue in the security business. So, we're very bullish about the security business that I'd say the growth rates that we\u2019ve seen here, we think we can continue to grow the security business in the high 20s, low 30s for the reminder of the year. So, we're pretty bullish about the opportunities in security both this year and beyond. Thomson Leighton : Let me just add. Nominum is important to us for beyond just the direct revenue and of course the carrier relationships. Because of Nominum, we now see an enormous number of the DNS transactions. And we're in a unique position to identify the botnets and malicious activities close to real-time. And that's really useful for making our other security products where we're selling directly to enterprises be a lot stronger in terms of identifying malicious activities in particular Enterprise Threat Protector, which we can now leverage the data and the knowledge about the bad entities in Enterprise Threat Protector. So there is indirect benefits as well as it really as you go forward I think in cyber security the access to the data being able to process at a near real time we have the latest in AI and machine learning capabilities gives us a great leg up on potential competition. Siti Panigrahi : That\u2019s great color. Just a quick follow-up, how much was the SOASTA contribution this quarter in Q1? Thomson Leighton : I mean, we are not going to -- we don\u2019t break those amounts separately that\u2019s SOASTA get sold across both of our divisions, I don\u2019t recall the exact amount for SOASTA. But I would say that across all of the new product areas SOASTA being one of them. As Tom mentioned, the new product area that we\u2019ve launched within the last kind of 12 to 15 months now are well over $100 million annualize run rate. So we\u2019re very pleased with the innovation that you\u2019ve see in the company, some of it come through M&A, but a lot of it is come through just organic innovation that we\u2019ve driven that is now becoming a meaningful contributor to the Akamai revenue stream. Siti Panigrahi : Perfect, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Brad Zelnick : Excellent and congratulations on a great quarter guys. I think I have got one for Tom and one for Jim. For Tom, some of your smaller competitors just recently in the last quarter or so introduced the ability to run code at the network edge, is this something you need to offer to be competitive and how do you think about that opportunity? Thomson Leighton : Yes, we\u2019ve done that for a long time, really long time. Now as we -- and we continue to work in that area particularly as we support non-HTTP protocols, as we support containers at the edge for IoT, kinds of services. But that\u2019s not a new thing. I think some of the applications coming in IoT are pretty exciting that we\u2019ll probably talk more about that at the Investor Day. Brad Zelnick : Appreciate the perspective. And Jim, as we look at the actions that you took last year to capture more traffic share in Media, they are clearly paying off, you have now seen accelerated traffic growth the last few quarters. But how should we think about the duration of that benefit, you talk about a focus on the top 250 accounts, have all of those accounts been restructured and or is there still some way to go like that we get to a point where you anniversary the benefit. How do we think about the timing and duration benefit? James Benson : Yes, I mean, you are always new on customer, I\u2019d say the majority of the customers that we thought to kind of reprice we have already done. We did in the back half of last year and a little bit in Q1. But you got to remember that what drives the Media business is traffic volumes. And so, yes, there is an element of anniversarying kind of agreements, but what you want to drive in the Media business, because the media is about traffic and price. So if you want the customer on the platform and you want the customer to push as much traffic volumes as possible. So do you that through giving them the price point and delivering the best performance and quality. And so, by doing that, we believe we\u2019re in a good position, focusing on these top 250 customers and also focusing on maybe new emerging customers that we think are going to be big traffic pushers. And just making sure that again they have the right price point and they have the right contract structure in place. And we think the combination of those two things are going to allow the Media business to continue to grow. Now as we\u2019ve said in the past the Media business is variable because the nature of traffic is variable. We had a good quarter this quarter, we had a good quarter in Q4 and in Q3. Some of this quarter it was stronger across the board, but some of this quarter as I mentioned, we had a very, very strong gaming quarter, there were some gaming releases in the quarter. We had a very strong quarter as Tom mentioned around video delivery, some of that video delivery growth that was really strong came from these major sporting events that we mentioned. And while they are not by themselves a huge contributor to revenue, they do contribute especially large sporting events like the Olympics the last couple of week time period. So, we are pretty bullish on the Media business, on a long-term if you look at this thing over a multiple kind of years, this has proven to be a consistent revenue contributor and we think that actually the recovery we have seen here and the focus that we have are going to continue to fuel growth in the Media business going forward. Brad Zelnick : Thanks very much and congrats again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha from B. Riley FBR. Your question please. Sameet Sinha : Yes, thank you very much. I am going to have two questions here. So, first one, in terms of cost savings, Jim can you help us think about the initiatives that you put into place in Q4, Q1 you will obviously have some savings because you're not mitigating against Limelight anymore? And then also if you can add, one of the arrangements you had with your activist investor was to hire a consulting firm to look more into these. Can you help us think -- can you tell us whether you -- it\u2019s already been done where it's in the process or if they are in the process of kind of giving their recommendations? And my second question is, you have spoken about OTT, gaming I guess sports is part of OTT or video. So this -- I think this should be a good growth driver for the next couple of years, can you help us think about long-term what other applications are used cases are there that can leverage your network so we can get a kind of good sense of what are the growth drivers longer term? James Benson : Well, I will let Tom comment on the second one. But on the cost savings again kind of similar question to the gentleman that asked a few questions before, we took some action in Q4, we took some further actions in Q1 again the employee actions are largely behind us. The actions are certainly much, much more that though that there is actions we are taking around a bunch of different areas. And I mentioned facilities being one, third-party vendor savings being another. We're going to continue to drive those areas, in additional to areas around driving more costs out of the network, being able to scale better on the network. And I would say relative to some of the announcements that we made in March with the settlement with Elliott that effectively what we talked about was that we were going to form a finance community for the company for the Board that was going to oversee the work we're trying to drive to find a path or see if we could find a path to drive operating margin to 30% in 2020. One of those things was to identify see if we can get a third-party consultant to help us. We have already made a selection on the consultant they have not yet begun they're going to begin this month. And so the work and the progress that we've made to-date is largely been driven by the actions and initiatives we took, really beginning in Q4 continuing in Q1, I think the work that we're going to do going forward are what are the areas that we can be smart about driving and scaling the business without doing anything that doesn't impact revenue growth. We want to make sure we're making the right investments in the business to fuel growth for the company. We have talked about a lot of areas already in the call, new product innovation areas that are fueling the growth for the company, making revenue much more diversified for the company, revenues much more diversified now by customers, it's much more diversified now by product.  We think that's important for the long-term. And we're going to continue to make those investments, while we're trying to drive initiatives that drive scale for the business and we think we can do both. Thomson Leighton : To your second question, we're just in the beginning with OTT and online gaming. We talk about some of these events that have still single-digit million concurrent viewers, tens of terabits a second of traffic, teens really. And those numbers can grow by one to two orders of magnitude so huge potential future growth there. So it's not the kind of thing that I think about OTT and gaming I am saying okay, that\u2019s done. We're just at the very beginning there and there's a lot of innovation that still we are working on to be able to deliver at enormous scales and make that be affordable, make it be really high quality and secure. In terms of things that are totally different and in the future, I think IoT is a very exciting area as billions of smart devices get connected probably not communicating using ATTP, but need to communicate you need real time command and control, data aggregation alerting these are things that Akamai is really good at. Having compute at the edge close to the device again something that Akamai is really good at. And we are probably be talking more about that at our Investor Day in June. But that's an area that I think we have a great future in, but really, really early days and an area that we're investing in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Your question please. Tim Horan : Thanks, guys. Two questions, on the cloud based real time multiplayer games, how well designed or equipped is your network to handle that? And do you have many competitors there? And then secondly, on the security side, maybe complicated question, but you have a bunch of security products, but is this the maybe half of the potential products that you could have in security or a quarter of the potential products. So just trying to get a sense of how much can you expand that portfolio of service offerings that you have in security side. Thanks. Thomson Leighton : Sure. In the multiplayer game today with our gaming business the revenue is primarily derived from handling the software downloads and updates to the devices that's the large majority of the revenue. I think as you look to the future actually handling the metadata around the games is a very interesting challenge especially as this gets done more in the cloud and maybe less on individual devices, that\u2019s an area that we're certainly exploring. Whether we've actually be delivering the video for a game where it\u2019s not being generated locally. I don't know we certainly have that capability that would come down to the economics. But all of the controller infrastructure associated and again this has to do with the Internet of Things as a whole. Gaming is one example of that that's an area where we've got I think a lot of value to add.  In terms of the security products, I would say for defending websites and applications against denial of service attacks and application layer attacks we're really doing a great job there, pretty unique in being able to offer the end-to-end solution that really works. Now of course, the bad guys are always upping their game and that's I think why our Bot Management Solution is being so successful today. Because it really can stop the account takers. And that has enormous value to a lot of our customers.  So there is a lot of work to keep up and doing that and staying ahead of the attackers. Now a whole new area where we're just entering is in the Enterprise Security. And that's blocking malware, protecting the enterprise, employees and data, it's enabling Enterprise Security in a world of zero trust, you just can't rely on your firewall anymore and you can't trust the entities inside the corporate network. That is a transformation of enterprise networking and security that is just starting. And I think that is an enormous future market, you just see all the damage being caused today by the data breaches. Clearly, there is no end-to-end solution there today that really you can rely on or you wouldn't be having all these data breaches. And that's an area, that we think overtime, we can have a comprehensive solution. Today, we're just in the first products to help combat that, it's an area we're making investments towards being able to really support an enterprise as they move beyond the traditional notion of a firewall and to protect them in a world of zero trust. And that has very large, I think a very large potential in market. Tim Horan : And just lastly on the clarify on the volumes. Are you back to kind of peak volume growth levels you were three, four years ago. Do you think you can get back there or maybe just a sense of where you all where be troughed out to where you were at peak a few years ago? Or kind of where you think that can go? Thomson Leighton : You mean the traffic growth levels? Tim Horan : Yes. Thomson Leighton : Yes, no our traffic growth has accelerated substantially and is at a very strong cliff now and well ahead of other reports you can see about traffic growth. And especially in OTT, which is where we're putting a lot of effort. So I think we're very pleased to see our traffic growth rates. Tim Horan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Breen from William Blair. Your question please? James Breen : Thanks for taking the question. Just can you talk about in terms of the growth in customer base? Is the growth coming from existing customers or are you adding new logos? And have you changed, how you go to market whether it's with the direct sales force or through channels that has helped in terms of the acceleration of revenue? Thanks. James Benson : Yes, I mean, I would say that you can -- most of the growth that we're seeing is from our existing customer base. We've made good progress on the new customer area. Actually from a new customer bookings perspective we actually had a strong quarter in the first quarter that I think we talked to you guys in the past that we've been tuning the go to market model to try to drive better new customer penetration. And I'd say early days just we're making some traction in that area, I think we have more work to do. That\u2019s notable in our Web Division where generating new customers is really important to drive growth not just through expanding with existing customers, but landing new customers. And we announced I think it was maybe just a few weeks ago that we brought on a new leader for our Web Division to run sales Scott Lovett, who has tremendous experience in driving both new customer penetration as well as kind of land and expand models. And so we are happy to have him as part of Akamai driving kind of the Web Division activities. And we are pretty bullish that we will make progress both in new customer penetration and in existing customer kind of penetration of our existing offerings. James Breen : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your question please? Heather Bellini : Hi. I just had a follow-up on the seasonality of the Media business, which the quarter saw much better seasonal trends than you normally see in a Q1. I guess, I'm wondering if you could share with us how we should think about the seasonality trends for this segment as the rest of the year shapes out. And how much of that uptick in better seasonality as a result of those fine tuning of the contracts that you mentioned? Thank you. James Benson : Hey, good question. You're right, we actually had a great Q1 relative to kind of seasonal pattern, usually see seasonally Q4 to Q1 the Media business softens a bit. And I think all the efforts that we put in place over the last several quarters you're starting to see the benefit of that and you saw that manifest itself Q1. And that was including kind of the internet platform customers coming down. So very, very strong kind of results. Now we talk about a lot of them that I think in general we have made good traction across all of our verticals, we had a particularly strong gaming quarter, I think as we talked about in the past the gaming releases don't happen linearly throughout the year. So we had a good gaming quarter in Q1, continued good quarter around OTT. For sure the sporting events did have some contribution. So is an element a Q1 that more sporting events happened this Q1 and typical, you don't have an Olympics every year that being maybe one example. But as far as the seasonal patterns through the year, I think, you'll probably feel a little bit Q1 to Q2, maybe a little bit less seasonal that usually I think media grows sequentially Q1, Q2 pretty significantly, but because of the strong Q1 you won't see as much of that. The summer will be typical, you will see patterns in the summer where Media from Q2 to Q3 will kind of go down in volume just because there is less consumption of content in the summer months. And then you'll see in Q4 a big uptick from Q3 to Q4 relative to the holiday season, the holiday season doesn't affect just commerce, but it also affects our Media business as well. So call it maybe a little bit less seasonal Q1 to Q2, typical seasonality Q2 to Q3 with it coming down and then a big Q4. Heather Bellini : And then just a follow-up, is the World Cup a bigger revenue event for you guys than the Olympics typically? James Benson : No, no, it isn't. And actually the World Cup straddles Heather over two quarters. And so. it\u2019s actually the funny part of it is it all depends upon the team to be very frank as far as viewing and who is winning. And so to some extent it depends upon that, but it is -- it doesn't drive the same level of traffic volumes, it does as part of the international markets in particular they tend to be bigger consumers of the World Cup in the U.S. market. And so you'll see that a bit, but it is -- it doesn't have the same impact to say in Olympics. Heather Bellini : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your question please. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Back to the platform customer contribution in the quarter the down 14%, was any of that exacerbated by contract renewals? And are we kind of freeing clear of those for the time being? James Benson : Well, we're always renewing customers and we did renew our largest customer in the first quarter and they've been contracted now another two years. And so the good news is that our largest customer is now secure on the Akamai platform for the next two years. And I think the other piece of it is revenue came in pretty much in line with what we expected, we expected Q4 to Q1 to come down. And as I said we expect this customer base to be in the low to mid-40s for the remainder of the year. Sterling Auty : Alright, great. And then you talked about the other actions that you're looking to go forward and complete. How do we think about how those savings layer in? Because I imagine some of them are international, some of them are domestic, and probably all those come out at once. So what should we think about in terms of the pace of those savings getting layered into the expense lines? James Benson : So you're talking about -- they are not expense savings. I mean, as you can imagine every quarter is a bit unique, that some quarter you have more events when I say events internal events. It could be an Edge Conference or customer conference or a customer conference. So spending is initially linear. But I think what you can expect is that we're going to drive or try to drive operating margin expansion between now and the end of the year. So I think maybe by the end of the year Q4, we'll probably be at our peak operating margins for the year. Some of that is due to the fact that Q4 has an uptick in revenue from Q3 to Q4. And then I think again, I'll outline more of this in late June when we have our Analyst Day that getting back to 30% margins or striving to get back to 30% margins by 2020 is going to happen overtime. And it's not just linear like every quarter progresses up. You might have -- it might pop a point a quarter and then it flat lines or it may be goes down. But I think you're going to see the general trajectory of operating margins expand from 2017 to 2018 from 2018 to 2019 and then 2019 to 2020. And we're going to work like how to try to find a path to find 30% margin by 2020. Sterling Auty : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your question please? Michael Turits : Hey guys. I'd like to come back to Enterprise Security both on the product side and on the go to market side. First of all on the product side, Tom, you mentioned Network Security where you don\u2019t have that much going on right now. I was wondering if you can drill down on that especially around Secure Web Gateway, which I believe is something that you've acquired a few years ago and lately we've had a company on security come public there is scalar so very high profile. Plus more specifically on Network Security and Secure Web Gateway. And then a little bit more on go-to-market. since that's not a place where you have a traditional channel. What do you need to do in order to really effectively go-to-market in that very, very different kind of a product area? Thomson Leighton : Yes. So ,we have today Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector, the next version of Enterprise Threat Protector will incorporate Secure Web Gateway functionality and strengthening that. And I think the foundation of the zero trust model to Protect Enterprise is that starts with Enterprise Application Access where the access to the internal application by the employee or the consultant would come through Akamai. And then we layer on top of that products like Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager for that matter. So that we apply the same level of defenses to your internal apps from your internal employees as you would for an external app that clearly is a subject to attack by any entity. And that's based on the belief that today the bad guys can get around pretty much any of the traditional enterprise defenses. Now in terms of go-to-market it's one of the reasons we're so excited to have Scot Lovett, join us to run our global web sales is that he has got a lot of experience in selling a wide variety of security products both from McAfee and from Cisco. And he's engaging very quickly there and I'm excited about his ability to help us in terms of helping establish that industry. It's very early days in the next generation of Enterprise Security, and I think he'll be a great leader in going into market there. Michael Turits : Great, thanks. And great quarter. Thomson Leighton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. Your question please? Jeff Kvaal : Yes, thank you. Two questions I think, one is would you mind refreshing us on where you are in the security attach rates to your Enterprise business the performance business? And where you think that may take us in the next few quarters or years? James Benson : Yes, well our security attach rates now for the company across all customers is around a little bit less than 40%. And so there are a long way to go now that wasn't that long ago I would tell you that number was 20% to 25%. So, we're continuing to make steady progress in security attach rate. It's also important to note that when we talk about attach rate, that's attaching at least one security product. And as we talked about on this call, our security products are growing a number. And so, it's not just about attaching one security product, now it's even for customers of the 40% that are buying security is not -- there is only a smaller percentage of them that are buying multiple security products. And so, the good news is we can sell more security products to our customers that already buy securities and there are a lot of customers that we don't -- that are already in the install base that haven\u2019t bought a security product. Not to mention, the ability to sell security outside of the installed base of our customers. And so we can continue to drive both expand rates within our existing customers and new customer attach rates. So, I think it'll continue to be our largest growing and fastest growing product category for the company. It'll probably grow in call the high 20s, low 30s this year I think it will continue to be again a 20s grower for the company for the near future. Jeff Kvaal : Okay, thank you. And then secondly there has been a lot of highly purposive weakness in linear video subscriptions at some of the cable companies and other satellite firms. How correlated do you think the performance of those subscriptions, subscriptions declined, declines our with your own Media business? Thomson Leighton : Well, obviously the more people that are subscribing and watching video online are the greater potential market for Akamai. And we have a large share of that market. So, our business as we\u2019ve talk about is rapidly growing in terms of overall traffic and now growing in terms of revenue. But the more video subscriptions there are, the better that is generally speaking for Akamai. Jeff Kvaal : Do you see that right away or is that spread that over a few quarters? How does that relationship work? Thomson Leighton : I think pretty near-term as people subscribe and start watching traffic would flow across our platform and for carrying it and often we are. And then we'd be billing for that traffic as it flow. So, I would say it's very close correlation in terms of people watching and ultimate revenue to Akamai. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you both very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee from Craig-Hallum. Your question please. Jeff Van Rhee : Great. Just one for me guys, first congrats on the quarter, just looks great across the board. On the CapEx front, are you came in a little heavier this quarter you certainly guiding to some pretty meaningful CapEx. Just spend a minute and talk about how you think about maybe the year? And in particular just sort of your visibility and your through process you put together the CapEx plan for the forward quarter and the forward year. How much can you see, how do you see and how much is a leap of phase based on sort of higher level modeling that you might do? Just a little visibility there would help. Thomson Leighton : It's a good question, I mean just to remind folks, that obviously of our CapEx that our CapEx is in three areas, there is network CapEx, which I think is what you are talking about. Then there is capitalized software and there is other CapEx for say facilities in IT. We spent about 17% of revenue, 16% to 17% of revenue on CapEx. Call it 6% of that is network CapEx, roughly 7% is capitalize software and the reminder facilities in IT. But on the network CapEx front, as I mentioned in my kind of prepared remarks that we did kind of spend a little bit more than we had guided in Q1 and that was very purposeful. And it was purposeful because you saw we had a great media quarter. And what we did was we began more CapEx purchases in the quarter. I guided to Q2 that you'll see that that step up in CapEx in Q2. And you can expect that we\u2019ll continue to build out for the reminder of the year. We'll stay within the call the 16% or 17% of revenue number. So, for the full year our CapEx will be about 16% or 17%.  And the way we think about network CapEx, we've reasonable visibility given the efforts that we've done and on the top 250 customers, call it within a range. And what we try to do is we're going to try to build out the network support the higher end of a range that you expect to have from those customers, so that you can make sure you have to pass through the available for them.  And that's the way we've done it, and that's the way we'll continue to do it, which means we should probably be within -- and those ranges are roughly where we've been historically call it somewhere between 15% and 17% of revenue, and that's probably we\u2019ll be this year. Jeff Van Rhee : And I guess just to follow on that in long-term as you see your business evolving certainly with the enterprise push as well as the strengthen in security. Is there anything inherent in the structure of the business going forward that you think drives that CapEx number higher or lower if we look over sort of intermediate to long-term? Thomson Leighton : Yes, I think the intermediate term we are going to stay probably in the 15% to 17% range. That's about what I except that it actually may have given all the innovation we're doing actually might even see a bit of an uptick in capitalized software. You might see it balancing it a little bit in network. And one thing is probably important to note and I will talk about this more at the Investor Summit, but we're building out or will be building out a new corporate headquarters here in Cambridge. And so you'll see some onetime CapEx here later in 2018 and much more notably in 2019 as a result of building out the headquarters. But I\u2019d say in general 15% to 17% of revenues is what you'd expect for CapEx. Jeff Van Rhee : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Power from Baird. Your question please. Will Power : Great, thanks. Nice job on the margins in the quarter. I guess question is as you look forward, with 38% EBITDA margin in Q1, guiding to 39% in Q2, is there any reason that wouldn\u2019t continue to uptick in Q3 and Q4 I think for a previous question you've referenced some deposit leverage in Q4 and I guess what I'm getting as built on your 39% for the year could be conservative. So just trying to understand kind of the second half outlook? James Benson : As I mentioned, it is in the straight line as far as every quarter that it just is going tick up. I think the third quarter in particular will potentially be a more difficult quarter for the company. It is a quarter that the company's does a seasonal kind of salary increase for its employee. And so you'll see a natural lift and standing from Q2 to Q3, let me go through that. And so, I think that 39% EBITDA, 25% operating margins, felt about right for us. I would say if we've tracking more to 26%, which is the high of our range in Q2, might you be able to round for the full year to 26% maybe. I'd say that I don't -- I think we're more comfortable guidance to 39% EBITDA or 25% operating margin. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here that it is -- like I say it isn\u2019t quite it grows a point every quarter just doesn\u2019t quite work that way.  But I think we're confident that by the end of the year, you'll be exiting at the highest operating margin level for the company. And you\u2019ll have that going into 2019 and then we have work to do in 2019 as well. Will Power : Okay. Tom Barth : Operator we have time for one more -- sorry about that, we've time for one more question operator. Operator : Okay. [Operator Instructions] And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the program back to Tom Barth. Tom Barth : Thank you, Jonathan. In closing we'll be presenting at several investor conferences in May and June and as Tom and Jim have mentioned holding our Analysts Day here in Cambridge on June 26th. Details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And thank you for join us and have a nice evening. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Good day.",

And welcome to the second quarter 2018 Akamai Technologies, Incorporated earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you very much and good afternoon and thank you for joining Akamai's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on July 31, 2018. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found in the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the second quarter. Revenue was $663 million, up 9% over Q2 of last year, with continued very strong performance for our Security products and continued improvement in our Media and Carrier Division. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.83 per diluted share, up 34% year over year. This, very strong result, was driven by our solid revenue growth, the impact of the cost reductions that we made in the two prior quarters and a lower tax rate. EBITDA margins in Q2 improved to 39% and non-GAAP operating margins improved to 26%. We expect further improvements in margins by the end of the year as we realize the benefits of projects underway to improve our operational efficiency. And we're continuing our work to find a path to achieve non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while maintaining investment in the development of new products intended to fuel our future growth. Our Security portfolio was, again, the fastest-growing part of our business with Q2 revenue of $155 million, up 33% over Q2 of last year. We've been very pleased with the performance of our Security business, which has received accolades from several leading analyst firms over the last few months. In April, Frost & Sullivan recognized Akamai for market leadership in bot risk management and in May they recognized us for market leadership in holistic web protection. In June, Forrester ranked Akamai highest among all competitors in web application firewalls and we were the only company to receive Forrester's top score possible for zero-day attack capabilities. Also in June, IDC issued a new vendor profile of our Security capabilities that said Akamai has had the strongest and broadest Edge security offering for quite some time. And all this comes on top of Gartner's recognition last year of Akamai as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Web Application Firewalls. Our Security products were an important contributor to the revenue in our Web Division in Q2. Overall, Web Division customers generated $351 million in revenue in the second quarter, up 11% over Q2 of last year. This is a little lower than what we'd like to see from the Web Division. And as we talked about during our Analyst Day last month, we've taken several steps to drive a stronger growth rate going forward. Most notably, we've added new leadership in Global Web Sales, increased our inside sales and sales development functions to drive new customer acquisition, simplified our pricing and packaging bundles for multi-product sales, focused effort on accelerating customer adoption of our mobile solutions, and we're improving our ability to cross-sell our new products into the existing customer base. We continue to see strong traction for our new products in Q2, including mPulse, Image Manager, Bot Manager, Enterprise Threat Protector and Enterprise Application Access. Revenue from our new products exited the quarter with an annualized run rate of about $170 million, more than tripled the run rate from Q2 of last year. Revenue for our Media and Carrier Division in Q2 was $312 million, up 8% over Q2 of last year. This much-improved performance is a result of our successful integration of Nominum and the work that we've been doing to improve our traffic share in the top 250 global media accounts. Traffic growth on the Akamai platform continued to accelerate in Q2 with especially-strong growth in our OTT and gaming sectors. Downloads of the new Fortnite game set a record for a single video game release with over 22 terabits per second of traffic delivered for a single customer at the peak. I think it's worth noting that this customer moved from one of the world's largest cloud platform providers to Akamai in the months leading up to the release. Not just because of our scale and global reach, although that's really important when you have a game of this size and an audience of this magnitude, but also because we achieved a five times reduction in error rates, which provided a much better experience for their end users. We also set traffic records for streaming the World Cup. Akamai served 55 broadcasters from around the world during the tournament and there were several days when our total World Cup traffic exceeded 20 terabits per second. To put this amount of traffic into context, 20 terabits per second is more than 10 times the aggregate border capacity of some major countries. On the other hand, it's not hard to imagine that the demand for online traffic someday could grow to a 1,000 times this amount. Delivering traffic at scale is very hard to do and it's something that the Akamai Edge platform is uniquely good at. That's because we place our servers in thousands of locations close to end users, well beyond the bottlenecks in the core of the Internet, where cloud data centers are typically located. The competitive takeaway of the Fortnite traffic I mentioned earlier and the well-publicized failures of two of the world's largest cloud platforms during the World Cup provides strong proof points as to why we believe that Akamai's unique architecture is so important and also why we think it will become even more critical as traffic levels on the Internet increase. In summary, I'm very pleased with our results in Q2. We continue to see very strong performance in our Security portfolio, improvement in our Media and Carrier Division, improvement in our margins and very strong growth on the bottom line. Before turning the call over to Jim, I'd like to mention that Akamai has a significant milestone coming up in the next month. August 20 will be the 20th anniversary of our founding. It has certainly been an eventful 20 years, as we've grown from the early days as an MIT startup to become the world leader in content delivery, application performance, and cloud security. And I want to thank all our employees for their sustained track record of innovation and hard work and also our customers for their partnership and trust. We've accomplished a lot together over the last 20 years, but I really do believe that the best is yet to come. In part, that's because I believe that Akamai's current business is very well positioned to benefit from major market tailwinds, as large volumes of media move online, the scale and sophistication of cyber attacks grow, and more applications move to mobile devices, where near-instant performance is the expectation. I'm also excited by our progress in the development of an entirely new generation of services to support our customers' future needs in the areas of blockchain, the Internet of Things, and zero-trust security architectures. Predicting the future is never easy, but as I look forward to the next 20 years, I see very bright prospects for Akamai and our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to review our financials and guidance for the rest of the year. Jim? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom outlined, Akamai delivered strong second quarter on revenue, margins, and earnings. Q2 revenue came in at the high end of our revised guidance range at $663 million, up 9% year over year or 8% in constant currency, and up 10% in constant currency if you exclude the six large Internet Platform Customers. Notably, this is the second straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth outside the Internet Platform giants. Revenue was solid across most of the business, highlighted by continued robust growth in our Security Solutions from both of our divisions and another quarter of strong traffic and revenue growth acceleration in our Media and Carrier Division. Revenue from our Media and Carrier Division customers was $312 million in the second quarter, up 8% year over year or 7% in constant currency, and up a healthy 12% in constant currency excluding the large Internet Platform Customers. Revenue from the Internet Platform Customers was $44 million in the second quarter, unchanged from Q1 levels. Q2 revenue outside these Internet giants was strong across all geographies and industry verticals, exceeding our projections for the quarter. Traffic growth accelerated for the fourth straight quarter and was particularly robust from our video delivery and gaming customers. And as Tom mentioned, we also had several notable events in the quarter that contributed to the strong traffic and revenue growth, with soccer and cricket events seeing record-breaking online audiences. Our Media and Carrier Division management team remains focused on capturing more traffic share and improving the quality of delivery for the top 250 media customers that account for most of our traffic and revenue. Because of these efforts over the past year, traffic growth continues to accelerate and we have seen the associated revenue acceleration that we expected when we initiated these actions. Moving now to our Web division, revenue for this set of customers was $351 million, up 11% year over year or 9% in constant currency. This growth rate came in a little bit below what we expect for this business due to some pricing compression within our delivery-based performance solutions. We are confident in the Web division growth strategy we outlined at our Analyst Day, specifically focusing on expanding the portfolio through new product development and acquisition, selling additional solutions into the installed base, simplified pricing and packaging bundles for multi-product deployment, and implementing go-to-market enhancements that we believe will accelerate new customer acquisition. And as Tom highlighted, we continued to see strong uptake in our new product areas in the first half of the year, namely Image Manager, Digital Performance Management, and Bot Manager, as well as strong growth in our core Kona and Prolexic cloud security solutions. We believe continued execution in all these areas will enable low double-digit revenue growth in this division. Turning now to our results for our Cloud Security Solutions, second quarter revenue was $155 million, up 33% year over year or 31% in constant currency, and yet another quarter of tremendous revenue growth and customer adoption for our Cloud Security Solutions globally. We're particularly pleased with the recent uptick in Security Solutions purchased by our media customers. Entering the third quarter, our Cloud Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of roughly $640 million and represents nearly a quarter of our total revenues. We believe security continues to present a significant growth opportunity for us, and we plan to continue to invest in this area, with a focus on further enhancing our product portfolio and extending our go-to-market capabilities. Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 38% of total revenue in Q2, up 1 point from Q1 levels. International revenue was $250 million in the second quarter, up 21% year over year or 18% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $5 million on a sequential basis and a positive impact on revenue of $8 million on a year-over-year basis. Revenue from our U.S. market was $413 million, up 3% year over year and up 6% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers. Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q1 levels and up 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. We are pleased with our continued execution on our platform efficiency initiatives. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%, roughly consistent with Q1 levels and slightly below our guidance, as we introduced more capitalized software projects onto the platform throughout the quarter. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $248 million, slightly below the low end of our guidance and down about $11 million from Q1 levels, due to continued traction with our operational efficiency efforts and the restructuring benefit from our first quarter reduction in force. Moving now to profitability, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $262 million, up $6 million from Q1 levels and up $40 million or 18% from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in as expected at 39%, a 1 point improvement over Q1 levels, primarily due to the strong revenue achievement and the additional operational efficiency gains I just mentioned. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $170 million, up $3 million from Q1 levels and up $25 million or 17% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 26%, up 1 point from Q1 levels and at the high end of our guidance range. I am very pleased with the margin expansion we have seen as a result of our ongoing efficiency efforts, and we believe our continued hard work can drive further operating margin improvements. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $102 million and below the low end of our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to the timing of some planned network investments and facility projects that shifted into Q3. Moving on to earnings, non-GAAP net income was $143 million or $0.83 of earnings per diluted share, coming in $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range, driven by slightly lower operating expenses and a lower tax rate. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $33 million based on a Q2 effective tax rate of 19%, which equates to a year-to-date effective tax rate of 19.5%. This tax rate is roughly 1 point lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings. Moving on to our GAAP earnings, there was a large and noteworthy item excluded from our non-GAAP results but impacting our Q2 GAAP results that I'd like to provide some color on. We were proud to endow the Akamai Foundation with a onetime $50 million grant in the second quarter. The associated $50 million charge is classified as an operating expense in the G&A line of our GAAP P&L. We believe this onetime endowment is important for several reasons, because it, one, solidifies our ongoing commitment to support STEM initiatives for underrepresented population in the technology industry today. Two, enables consistency in charitable giving from one year to the next, regardless of fluctuations in economic cycles or annual profits. And three, is reflective of our values and we believe initiatives like this have a very positive impact in employee recruiting and retention efforts. And lastly, it resonates with investors' corporate responsibility expectations. Factoring in this onetime GAAP-only item, GAAP net income for the second quarter was $43 million, or $0.25 of earnings per diluted share. Now, I'll review our use of capital. In May, we closed a $1.15 billion convertible debt offering concurrent with a $500 million revolving credit facility, further strengthening our balance sheet for additional strategic flexibility. We believe these cost-effective transactions will support our overall operating cash requirements, as well as previously-announced capital return initiatives, while at the same time maintain our ongoing strategic flexibility to be opportunistic with M&A. We continue to focus on the importance of returning capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we spent $166 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 2.2 million shares. As I mentioned last quarter, we plan to spend our current share repurchase authorization of $750 million by the end of 2018. Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, beyond 2018, we intend to continue our share repurchase activity but at a lower spend level and with the objective to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and, at times, to opportunistically repurchase more shares depending upon business and market conditions. As always, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. In summary, our Q2 top and bottom-line results met or exceeded the high-end of our guidance. We continue to see a robust pipeline of innovation across the company and we believe we are making good progress on our operational efficiency and margin expansion efforts. Looking ahead to Q3, we are expecting another solid quarter on the top and bottom lines. As we outlined at our Analyst Day in June, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the last several months continues to negatively impact our revenues. In fact, these foreign exchange headwinds have worsened by couple-million-dollars just since that event. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q3 revenue of over $6 million compared to Q2 levels and a $5 million impact year-on-year. Taking into account these foreign exchange headwinds, combined with typical summer traffic seasonality, which has historically resulted in sequential declines in our Media business, we are projecting Q3 revenue in the range of $656 million to $668 million. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of roughly 78% and GAAP gross margins of 65%, both up from Q2 levels. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $249 million to $254 million, up modestly from Q2 levels and reflecting the seasonality of our annual merit increases. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins of 39% to 40%, consistent to slightly up from Q2 levels. Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $93 million to $96 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 25% to 26% for Q3, roughly consistent with Q2 levels. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.80 to $0.86. This EPS guidance assumes an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of roughly 20%. This guidance also reflects a fully-diluted share count of 169 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend $115 million to $125 million, excluding equity compensation in the quarter. This is an uptick from Q2 levels, primarily due to facility build-outs in Bangalore, Costa Rica and the early phases of our new Cambridge headquarter building. We expect increased facility-related spend for our new Cambridge headquarters to continue into Q4 and 2019. Looking to the full year, we are anticipating revenue of $2.68 billion to $2.705 billion, up $5 million from the low-end of the range, EBITDA non-GAAP operating margins of 39% to 40%, and 25% to 26%, respectively. And factoring in these revenue and margin levels in a non-GAAP effective tax rate of roughly 20%, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.26 to $3.38 for full year 2018. And at the midpoint, this is an increase of $0.07 from our prior guidance. As a helpful reference, we will post our Q3 and full year 2018 guidance ranges on the Investor Relations section of our website after this call. In closing, we are very optimistic about the opportunities ahead for Akamai. We are confident in our ability to continue innovating to drive further revenue growth, while at the same time driving margin and earnings expansion for 2018 and beyond, which we believe will add significant shareholder value over both the near-term and long-term. Thank you. And Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask specifically on the Media Division relating back to the pricing actions and contract restructuring in Media from a year ago concentrating more on the top 250. Where are we in terms of the benefit? How much longer should we expect that that lasts? And how much of the traffic this quarter would you describe as being more event-related versus predictable and ongoing? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Good question, Brad. So, as we talked about, for the last several quarters, we really initiated a much more aggressive posture around going after traffic share, and that began in late Q2 of last year. And as you can imagine, some of that meant opening up contracts earlier, some of it meant that we applied some more creative pricing for contracts that were coming up for renewal. But I would say, largely speaking, that we'd anniversaried a lot of that and so you're going to have renewals every quarter, but most of the actions that we were going to take we've already taken over the last year. So, I think what you're in for now is a continued focus on us maintaining traffic share and, obviously, there's new customers to be had and where we can grab more traffic share from customers, we're certainly doing that. But I would say the bulk of those actions are completed and now we're back into business as usual, which is basically ongoing renewals that happen every quarter. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. That's helpful. And I just had one more follow-up on the Web Division, where you've spoken about several initiatives to help drive growth into double-digits going forward. And some of them seems like go-to market and go-to-market leadership, some of them seemed around pricing and packaging. Can you maybe just expound a bit more on pricing and packaging and innovation? What specifically is there to be done and how do you think that that's going to play out? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Let me offer some comments and then if Tom has anything else he can offer. Obviously, what we have been doing and we shared this at the Analyst Day, company's done a fantastic job of introducing new products and developing new products. And so we've already been doing a fair amount of that. We talked about the new products that we've introduced in the last 18 months, actually have generating an annualized revenue run rate now of almost $170 million, so there's been a lot of work on, call it, the development side. And you're right, there's certainly been work on the go-to-market side, because if you got to develop products, you have to sell them. The sales force has done a very good job of selling these products into the installed base. We have more work to do there but I'd say good early signs. And the comments around pricing and packaging are less about we're going to do something like on the Media business, where we effectively went in and we creatively priced to grab more traffic share. The Web Division is not about traffic share. The Web Division is about bookings. What we mean by that is packaging offerings that we can bundle some our solutions around Security and Performance and other areas in a much simpler way for customers to consume, so they can buy multiple products from Akamai as opposed to buying individual products \u00e0 la carte, bundling products to make it easier for customers to buy more of our portfolio so there's more creative things that we're doing there which makes \u2013 they're really more packaging and promotional-related activities, really to introduce the customer to more of what Akamai has to offer. And, Tom, I don't know if there's anything else you'd add. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No, I think you characterized it well, and our ability to package together the world's leading Security capabilities with the world's leading Performance is very powerful, and that helps us retain and grow the Web customer base. It's the person who owns the website needs it to be secured, needs it to be fast. And if they can go to one vendor and get the best of both, that's just an incredibly powerful combination. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks very much for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good evening. First of all, I'd like to congratulate Akamai and, of course, Tom and the founders on that 20-year anniversary. I hate to admit how many of those years I've actually been following the company, but it's a big number. Anyway, congratulations. Two questions. One, maybe you could parse for us the drivers of the traffic acceleration in the quarter. How much of it do you think was wallet share versus organic customer growth in traffic? And where do you think that \u2013 do those trends continue or do those both flatten out at this point? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's both. We are, I believe, increasing traffic share and you can see that from the rate of traffic growth, which has accelerated now for four straight quarters, well beyond any published estimates of Internet traffic growth, and that means that we're gaining share. And we see that at times when there's big events when companies turn to Akamai, of course, to do that and in the cases when they don't, there can be failures and other things happen, poorer quality, which helps Akamai gain share. At the same time, there is more viewing online. When you look at the aggregate traffic levels for events like the World Cup, far more viewing online than four years ago. You look at the big gaming downloads, like Fortnite, much larger traffic levels than you would see for gaming downloads even a year ago. So, it's a combination of both. The tide is rising as a whole and there's the potential for a lot more of that as we've talked about and I think we're gaining share at the same time. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So, it sounded, Jim, like you were saying that you were going to focus on maintaining share. So, of that component of acceleration that had to do with more share gains, should we be less focused on that at this point? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Obviously, as you can imagine, for customers that multi-source, we're always looking to maximize our share. So where there's a chance to maximize more share, we're certainly going to do that. So we're not content maintaining share with a customer that is splitting their traffic. We've made a fair bit of headway on that, and we'll continue to work on that with customers. I don't want you to think that it's job over, that maintaining share is what we're looking for. We're always driving to maximize as much share. What I was trying to imply is that, the work that we began late last Q2, we've largely gone through most of those customers and we've made great traction, and that traction actually is now manifesting itself in the performance that you're seeing that the revenue growth outside of the Internet Platform Customers grew 12% in the Media and Carrier Division. This is really a function of what we said was going to happen when we embarked on these efforts, and so we executed well and we're actually seeing the benefit of that now in revenue acceleration. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Jim. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. I think in your remarks you noted that you continue to be interested in potentially bolting on via M&A to the Security business, both from a technology and a go-to-market perspective. I was just wondering if you could add some more color around what you're thinking potentially from a go-to-market, obviously, not companies but what exactly it is you're looking for. My understanding is those types of companies are relatively expensive. Should we be preparing for a transaction that could ultimately end up being dilutive to the company in the near term? And then secondly, as it relates to the Web division, you mentioned a lot of different initiatives you're doing to improve the trajectory of revenue growth. When do you think we'll start to see that show up in the numbers? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: So in terms of M&A and Security, that's an area where we're always looking for acquisitions. We've done several over the last few years. You are correct that often companies that we would look at have pretty wild valuations sometimes and you're not going to see us do anything foolish. So when we make acquisitions, we're very disciplined, and we've been really happy with the acquisitions we've done, particularly in the Security space. Now in terms of boosting our go-to-market presence, I think that's of more interest on the Enterprise Security side, and it's a factor that we think about when we look at potential acquisitions. That said, we're getting very good traction now with our Enterprise Security sales. Q2 was very strong there and growing. So it's not something that it's a have-to-do, but if we can find an acquisition that makes sense financially, can add product capabilities for our customers, having an improved go-to-market presence is just a plus there. And, Jim, do you want to take the second question? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Colby, I think obviously the Web division is a bookings-driven business, as we talked about at the Analyst Day. And so it's a business that is going to take a while to move up or down, to be frank. We're just a tick below the double digits that is our objective for this division. So it's very possible you're back to double-digit growth in Q3, to be very frank. I think we're going to be in that range of high single digits to low double digits here in the near term. I think all the efforts that we outlined between adding more products, penetrating more of these products into our installed base, better packaging and pricing, enterprise license agreements, and one thing we didn't really comment on specifically, at least in the Q&A, is really making a concerted effort to do more in new customer acquisition. We've done a very good job as a company of selling more into our installed base. We have work to do around new customer acquisition, and we saw some early progress on that in Q2. And certainly, our new Web Sales leader, Scott Lovett, this is a big priority for him to get the new customer acquisition engine moving. And I think all those areas are going to really be the catalyst that drives the company to maintain double-digit growth in the division. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. You talked about in the Web Division seeing some pricing compression and then all the offsets you had against that. Could you spend a little bit of time on that pricing compression? What are the drivers of that? Is that cyclical, structural, competitive, and the likelihood of that pricing compression staying there for the foreseeable future? Thanks a lot. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: It's a good question. I think we talked about the \u2013 in the Web Performance product area before that certainly when offerings come up for renewal, customers always expect the price of technology to go down, and it's varied based on customers that push a lot of traffic versus customers that don't. It varies based on customers that see a lot of value in the performance sensitivity of their traffic. And so it's not new. I would say what's heightened is there are certain industry verticals. A notable industry vertical where pricing pressure is pronounced is in commerce or retail. As you can imagine, that's an industry phenomenon that there are some large disruptive players in the retail space, and many of our customers are competing with them. And when they're looking at their P&L, they're looking at areas that they can go reduce costs. And so we've not seen really any increase in churn. As a matter of fact, churn is actually at a low for the company. So we're not losing customers at all. It's just in the Web Performance space there are certain verticals, with retail/commerce being a big one, that customers are very, very price sensitive because their business models depend upon being competitive against some of these large players. And so I don't expect that to abate, to be frank. I think we're going to continue to see that. I think the strategy that we've been embarking on is the right strategy, which is new product penetration, broadening your products, and then penetrating your products into the installed base and actually getting more traction on new customers. So that's really the recipe for improving performance. I don't think you're going to see the Web Performance area, though, abate as far as the pricing competitiveness. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thank you, Jim. And congratulations, Tom. That's a hell of an accomplishment; 20 years. Thank you. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. I just wanted to follow up on Mark's question a little bit in regards to the pricing pressure that you mentioned in the Performance Solutions Group. I was just wondering. How do we think about the level of price declines you saw in the quarter versus, say, the average over the last three to four quarters? And how do we think of the headwind going forward and how do we think about the headwind to revenue in the second half 2018 and looking beyond in 2019? Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: To follow on to what Mark said, I would say that you've probably seen an uptick a bit here over the last, call it, six to nine months. But as I said before, the Web Performance products, we've always had that depending upon the nature of the customer. And so you can view it as it's already in our run rate, so the fact that we grew about 9.5% in constant currency in Q2, I don't expect it to worsen in the sense that I think it's already embedded in the run rate. I think the work we have ahead is to continue to make traction in the areas that I outlined. Those traction in the areas outlined, we've already made traction in those areas... Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: ...are really going to be what is the catalyst to get us to maintain double-digit growth. Is Web Performance going to get worse? I don't think it's going to get worse. I think we're seeing pricing sensitivity with particular verticals. I think that that will remain, and I think the areas that we're doing \u2013 and I think some of the pricing and packaging is a good way to offset that, where you can sell your Web Performance product, you can sell Digital Performance Management, you can sell Image Manager, you can sell Security, a lot of the things that Tom talked about that actually make you much stickier with customers and actually allow you to maintain more value with those customers, the entire \u2013 all the solutions that's you're selling them. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, so you don't see it spreading beyond the retail customers, is that what you're saying? Or are you saying the level of pricing for everybody as the pricing pressure has gone up a little bit across-the-board? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No. As I said, it's more pronounced in certain verticals and I specifically commented on the retail vertical because I think it's a notable vertical where we're seeing it. But I think, in general, the price of technology comes down, customers expect better value for the offerings that they get and so what we're doing is we are accommodating that but, at the same time, we are leveraging, selling them more products, and so we're able to retain more value with the customer and actually have more products when the sales cycle is completed. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, good afternoon. My question, Tom, is on the U.S. business. It's been underperforming low-single-digit. The overseas business is outperforming. What are your thoughts on what might be the catalyst or fundamental drivers for reaccelerating growth in the U.S. business? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Well, of course, the U.S. business includes the giant platform, cloud platform companies, which helps depress the growth rate there. And we made a lot of investments overseas and particularly in APJ, have a lot of success, overseas revenue growing at a very good clip. There's a lot of people and major businesses there, a lot of potential to grow further. And, Jim, would you like to add anything to that? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: No, I don't think so. I do think that what you outlined is right, that we made a lot of investments. We're getting traction in the overseas market. I think the U.S. market grew kind of outside the Internet giants, I think we said it grew in kind of the mid-single-digits. I think we can do better than that, Vijay, to be frank. And I think that, obviously, there's some work to be done there. As Tom said, the overall growth is impacted by the giants but some of the area that we've seen slowing in the Web Division has come from our kind of U.S. market, and there's a lot of work to try to improve on the growth rate in the U.S. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. A quick follow-on, Jim, in terms of OpEx efficiencies. Anything we could expect on that front through year-end, like any consultant activities, cost-cutting initiatives? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, it's ongoing, right? So there's work that we've been doing. We did a restructuring in Q4 and another restructuring in Q1. We've seen the benefit of that. We saw it over the last couple of quarters. There's a bunch of areas we're going to drive further efficiency. I think I said in the last call that this is a company that we're not in any level of distress, we want to make sure that our operational efficiency actions are very measured and that we're doing things that allow us to better scale costs going forward. This isn't just reducing cost. This is about being able to scale cost as the business grows. And so, there's a bunch of areas that we've done that with. We outlined some of them as areas around facilities that we've closed, there's some third-party spend reduction initiatives. We have had a consultant in to help us identify areas, so that work is underway. We're kind of at the first phase of that effort and now we're in the next phase, which is trying to go operationalize these actions. Operationalizing these actions means standardizing processes in certain areas, automation in certain areas. And as I mentioned at the Analyst Day, we'll probably make some investments here in the near-term. So, we're going to see margin expansion for the company throughout this year and you'll probably see modest margin expansion in 2019 but it won't be significant in 2019 largely because we're going to make some structural investments that are going to help the company better scale. But I think we're on a good path. I think the work that we're doing is very measured, very responsible, and really keeping in mind making sure that we take the right actions while, at the same time, investing in the areas that are going to drive revenue growth for the company. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Very helpful. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from James Fish of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions here. I guess just maybe how much is OTT traffic now as a percentage after this quarter? And can you just clarify what the pricing discount of OTT traffic is compared to sort of the average Internet traffic that hits Akamai's network today? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. OTT traffic is the largest source of traffic for us, and it's approximately half of our total traffic. The pricing depends on the volume of traffic from any given customer. And the major broadcasters and media folks tend to push a lot of the traffic and they would get the most competitive and lowest pricing per bit because of the volume discounts. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And then, maybe just to go back to some prior questions here, just on the comments around the Web pricing, that was primarily due to essentially the cloud service provider competitors? Or was that due to any private competitors out there like a Cloudflare, Fastly? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Well, no. As Jim mentioned, the customers themselves demand lower pricing. That's very common in technology. Some of the customers themselves are under competitive pressure from cloud giants. And we always had a wide variety of competitors. You have the cloud giants, some of them have been in the business of delivery now for over a decade. You've got start-ups and you've got the CDNs that have been in business for well over a decade. So, a wide variety of competitors there, and I don't think there's been any fundamental change in that landscape. James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Hey, guys. This is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling. So, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned about traffic which is accelerating and OTT and others being really streamed across your network. And in the past you had mentioned that when traffic accelerated, it takes about six to nine months before it actually manifests into revenue. So, seeing this particular traffic acceleration in 2Q and if it is secular, should we think about that revenue in the Media should actually grow at a healthy clip after two or three quarters? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. This is Jim. Really what we're referring to is when we go through a pricing renewal with a customer, which is effectively we began late Q2 last year and aggressively going after share, when you do that and you're repricing a customer, the comment about six to nine months is usually when you reprice a customer and you drop prices for them to a certain magnitude, it usually takes six to nine months to see revenue acceleration from that. So we're already seeing that. It's not necessarily a case where traffic accelerates and then you see revenue growth. It's really coupled with the renewal but we're pretty bullish in the Media business that we've done good work. Obviously, the Media business is certainly more variable than the Web Division set of customers because it's traffic-based and traffic is not linear. Secular trends would suggest traffic is going to continue to grow rapidly but from one quarter to the next traffic grows more rapidly due to more gaming releases or less gaming releases, sporting events or less sporting events, things of that nature, less seasonal viewing in the summer, more seasonal viewing in the winter. So, I think, in general, the Media business, there's a lot of things that drive traffic volumes and we're very bullish about the prospects of traffic volumes long-term. Quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see variability and we're pretty optimistic in the near-term from the actions that we've taken that we're doing all the right things, which is focusing on the right set of customers, trying to maximize share. And one thing that I want to make sure didn't get lost is one of the things that the media sales team did a great job of in the first half of the year is selling Security now to our Media customers, where I would say we've done a good job in the past of selling Security to our Web customers. They've done a very good job now of not just selling Media products to Media customers but also selling our Security products to Media customers. So, again, they're buying more of the portfolio. So good progress in Media overall. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Thanks. That's helpful color, Jim. And just as a follow-up, you mentioned about the renewals, so let me hit on that. So, any of the top six Internet Platform Customers that are expected to come up for renewal this year that we should expect should drive down the pricing for the next two quarters or something? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. We don't comment specifically on renewals every quarter. As you can imagine, 25% of our customers roughly renew every quarter. That includes these large Internet Platform Customers. So, there's nothing notable here in the near-term, but just understand that these large customers renew on a periodic basis and there's nothing imminent here. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Awesome. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from James Breen of William Blair. Your line is now open. James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Just looking at the guidance when implies for the fourth quarter, what gives you confidence on the cost side in terms of moving EPS and the margins up a little bit higher range? And then, secondly, if I missed it, just talk about the buyback in the quarter and how much stock you bought back. Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. On the Q4 margins, Jim, as you can imagine, some of what it's going to be is the seasonally you get a big increase in revenue Q3 to Q4. So we'll probably see based on our guidance the implied Q4 sequential growth is I think roughly 6%. All the work we're doing on operational efficiency, you're not going to see 6% growth in operating expenses. You're not going to see a 6% growth in our cost of goods sold. So, you're going to get some natural lift just because of seasonality of more revenue combined with the operational efficiency actions that we're taking, so that's going to really be the catalyst. I would say Q4 margins are going to be higher than probably the run-rate leap exiting the year, because, obviously, you don't see the same growth Q4 to Q1. But what gives us confidence is the actions we're taking, we have good line of sight to them the back half of the year. We have good confidence that we're going to have a solid Q3 and a strong Q4 based on the guidance. So, we feel pretty bullish about that. And on the buyback, I think we spent about $166 million in buyback for Q1. I think we spent about $20 million in Q1. So, we spent, call it, $190 million or so for the half and we'll spend the remainder to achieve our $750 million in Q3 and Q4. James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: So, there's just over $500 million left in the buyback. And then just one question on the guidance. What kind of assumptions are you making around FX as you're looking toward the full-year guidance? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: So something I made on FX is that I think I'd share with you guys at the Analyst Day what the impact was. And from the Analyst Day to today, for the full year, FX has worsened by about $3 million to $4 million, a couple million dollars in Q3, a couple million dollars in Q4. So call it the total from the last time we guided it, we provided you a guidance I think at our Analyst Day in June towards it by about $4 million. James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent, thank you, guys, for taking the question. I hate to beat a dead horse here, but I feel like I lost the thread on what you guys were trying to get across on the Web business. So you called out that the Web business performance was worse than expected. But then you're saying that the competitive environment hasn't really changed, so that's not a part of it, that new solutions, a lot of that that goes into Web Performance guys, are selling really well and they're ahead of your expectations. But the answer is packaging and pricing. So can you just pull it all together for us? What's the main message that you're trying to give us in terms of what's been negatively impacting the Web Performance business and what's going to change on a going-forward basis? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I think you got the points right there, and it's good to keep in mind that we've got a lot of the revenue in the Web Division is performance, and there's traffic delivery sensitive. And so that's where you see the price compression, which is a natural phenomenon. And really important to remember, and Jim mentioned this, that our churn is very low. And in Q2, in fact, it's one of the lowest quarters we've had in a long time. So it's not a situation where we're losing customers to any kind of competitor out there. There's just natural price pressure against the delivery products in the Web Division for those customers. Now, you also noted very correctly we're doing a great job with the new products and selling those, ramping the revenue from that up quickly. We're doing a fantastic job on the Security products, growing well over 30% and now at a pretty significant amount of revenue. And so that is driving the growth of the division and becoming an increasing part of the product mix, which is why we're optimistic about the future of Web Division growth, while we're dealing with some of the natural price compression in the delivery-based products in the division. Jim, do you want to add to that? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: I think you outlined it well. We weren't trying to imply, Keith, that there isn't competitive pressures in the business. As Tom outlined, there are. I think the question that someone asked is are we seeing this from the large cloud platform players. And I think what Tom was trying to outline is we see competition across those guys, startups, and then CDNs that have been around for a while. So we're seeing it in that space and we're seeing it notably in verticals that are particularly price sensitive given some of the industry dynamics. And so it's really a combination of all those factors that you're starting to see maybe more pricing compression in that business than maybe we've seen in the past. And again, we outlined all the things that we have been doing and will continue to do to drive the business forward so that we can maintain double-digit growth in the Web Division. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it, that's helpful. And then, Jim, one for you. In terms of the EPS guide, I think we added $0.06 between the Analyst Day and today, despite the fact, like you're saying, that FX is moving against you guys a little bit. Can you pinpoint for us where the increased efficiency is versus the Analyst Day come into that EPS line? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: We're probably going to do a little bit better on gross margins than what we had outlined at the Analyst Day. We're continuing to do \u2013 I highlighted that in my comments about continued progress around the platform efficiency initiatives. So we'll probably do a little bit better on gross margins than we had outlined. And again, we continue to drive very purposefully operating expenses. So probably notably cost of goods sold and then, call it secondarily, efficiencies within operating expenses. In particular, just making sure that areas that we're investing in are pretty prescriptive, and then the areas that we're scaling back on, whether they be third-party spend in other areas that you get more visibility to that every day as you go through inspecting that in more detail. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. And, Tim, if your phone is on mute, please unmute. And our next question comes from Sameet Sinha of B. Riley. Your line is now open. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Yes, thank you, a couple questions. So let's talk about the traffic acceleration (56:12) acceleration. As you had indicated previously in response to a question, as traffic accelerates, revenue starts to accelerate. So would you say that these are annual contracts? I'm just trying to figure out. At what point do you break even on these contracts? Obviously, you don't for the first couple of quarters. And my second is on the topic of performance, where you've seen the pricing pressure. Can you help us think about the exposure that you have in the retail segment? I guess that's retail and e-commerce, you pointed that out. I imagine it's probably a big piece, but can you help us think about what sort of exposure you have there? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Sameet, you broke up a little bit, to be frank. I think I got the two questions, I believe, which is you were wondering about traffic and revenue acceleration and the contract period that we have with customers. It varies. There are some customers that are annual. There are some customers that are multiyear. There's no one equation that I could give you that ties traffic and revenue acceleration with the contract cycle. I can tell you that certainly when we go through pricing renewals, we have traffic in mind when we're giving them a price point, and we have value in mind around what the margin profile is that we're looking to garner from a customer over the period. And we're not just looking necessarily at the year if they happen to have an annual contract. You're looking at a customer over multiple years because you want to make sure you are the provider of choice, not just for their current traffic but going forward. So I can't really give you an equation there other than to say you're starting to see progress in the Media Division. You're starting to see growth acceleration. It grew 4% in Q1. Media and Carrier grew 7% in Q2, so we're making very, very good progress. And as I said, the Media business has variability to it, so sometimes you have to be careful when you try to build an equation into it because a lot of things can affect traffic. And relative to performance pricing, there's not much more I can offer than what I already shared, which is it is a fact that the Web Performance delivery products, as Tom outlined, we are seeing some pricing compression there, and we outlined some of the things that are driving that. It depends upon the vertical. It depends upon the customer. It depends upon the type of traffic that is being served, whether it's really performance-sensitive traffic or whether it's traffic that is maybe less performance-sensitive. So all those variables come to play. I think it's fair to say that the Web Performance business is not like the Media business in some regards. There's certainly a more bookings-oriented business that does have a traffic component to it. But it certainly is something that the customer values based on the performance acceleration that is being given for whatever their traffic profile is, but there's not much more I can offer on performance pricing other than what I had already provided. Sameet Sinha - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. Just two left from me. I guess just one, Jim, on the CapEx side for the year and into next year you commented about the Cambridge facility. Just maybe a little expansion on how much of an upward bias that's going to put, what the numbers are around the Cambridge facility, and what kind of upward pressure that means next year. And then, second, within the Web Division as well you commented on the cross-sell as one of the key initiatives. What's the key metric that you're watching there that we should sort of use as the yardstick to see if you're making progress on the cross-sell? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: So, on the CapEx front that we've just begun, so the Cambridge \u2013 actually, the CapEx uptick in Q3 is not just our Cambridge headquarters. There's actually some work that we're doing for Bangalore, which is a large center for us, in Costa Rica which is another large center of excellence for us. But relative to headquarters, in particular, we're just at the early phases of the project and it will continue throughout 2019. You'll actually see the bigger impact on CapEx in 2019 and it will grow. Our CapEx as a percent of revenue model is about 15% to 17%. We'll be a little bit above that, more than likely, in 2019 as a result of the Cambridge headquarter building. I don't want to provide a specific number because there's a range that that could be and there's a bunch of things that could affect that. But the way you should think about it is it will probably be a bit above the high-end of our long-term model but it's only one-time. It will go down again in 2020. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. In terms of the second question, customers that buy more than one product is really important for us. We do a lot better in those accounts of course. And, for example, customers that would buy an acceleration product and then combine it with Image Manager, Digital Performance Management, one of our Security Solutions for example. the Kona Site Defender platform or the Prolexic platform. We're now packaging those together. And then as we go forward, as I mentioned, we're starting to get some pretty strong traction with our Enterprise Security products and we'll probably talk a lot more about that on the next Street call, but that will become a factor as well. We're also looking at Enterprise license agreements where you get the whole package and we've had some really outstanding recent success there. So, it's the keeping track of what the customers are buying in aggregate and obviously it's beneficial for us when customers use more of the Akamai platform and they buy some of our other market-leading capabilities. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Operator, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I'm curious, how would you guys characterize growth from your existing customer base over the last year versus maybe new customers in the last year? Is there anything that you can quantify for us? I know you had mentioned Epic Games as a new customer. And on a housekeeping basis, what was the contribution from Nominum in the quarter? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: So, it's hard to give you a specific on growth from existing customers versus new. I would tell you that we've done a better job over the last couple years in aggregate in selling more to our installed base set of customers. That's fair. We're working hard to get more of the new customer traction and actually that's much more of a Web Division phenomenon that even though we certainly are acquiring new customers in Media. That is a less customer acquisition intensive kind of division. We've had some notable wins there, obviously, Epic being one. So, in the Web Division, we've actually made good \u2013 we've made good progress. It's been an area that we struggled in in the past. We made very good progress in the second quarter and we're optimistic that some of the go-to-market change that's we made are going to show continued new customer improvements in the back half of the year. And relative to Nominum, we're not specifically calling out what the revenue contribution is. We've kind of embedded those offerings into our core offerings with our recursive DNS business. So I think that what we said at the time of the acquisition was that the business was a $30 million to $40 million annualized business. So you can kind of generally think that's roughly the contribution that you're getting on an annual basis. Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Jim. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.: Okay. Well, I guess, in closing, I want to again thank everyone for joining us today. We will be presenting at several investor conferences in August and September and details of those can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com, and we wish you all a wonderful evening. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Brad Zelnick - Credit Suisse Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2018 Akamai Technologies, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Tom Barth : Thank you, Gigi. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the Company's view on October 29, 2018. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Thomson Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the third quarter. Revenue was $670 million, up 7% over Q3 of last year and up 8% in constant currency, with continued very strong performance for our security products and continued improvement in our Media and Carrier Division. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.94 per diluted share, up 47% year-over-year. This very strong result was driven by our solid revenue growth, the impact of cost reductions made over the past year and a lower tax rate. EBITDA margins in Q3 improved to 41%, and non-GAAP operating margins improved to 27%. This mark the fourth consecutive quarter of improving margins and we expect further improvements by the end of the year. Looking further ahead, we are now confident that we can achieve non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while continuing to invest in innovation and new products to drive our future growth. In Q3, our security portfolio was again the fastest growing part of our business, with revenue of $169 million, up 39% over Q3 of last year in constant currency. Our security business accounted for 25% of our total Q3 revenue and exited the quarter at a run rate of nearly $700 million per year, making Akamai one of the world's largest cloud security providers. Our security products received accolades from two leading analyst firms last month. Gartner named Akamai as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Web application firewalls for the second year in a row. And Forrester named Akamai as a leader in its new wave for Bot Management, giving Akamai\u2019s our highest rating possible for attack response, threat research, reporting and analysis, roadmap and market approach. In a world where lots of claims are made by competing companies, it's gratifying to receive this level of recognition from the world's leading industry analyst firms. There are several reasons why Akamai is a leader in Cybersecurity. Our track record of innovation and emphasis on R&D combined with smart and accretive acquisitions. Our edge platforms enormous capacity and close proximity to users and devices, the insights in real-time data we gained from protecting so many of the world's leading enterprises, and our team of experts who provide exceptional customer service and support. Many of our customers have told us that they simply have too much at stake to risk their business on anything less. Most of our security revenue today is based on protecting public-facing websites and applications from denial of service and application-layer attacks. We've also been developing novel products to protect internal enterprise applications. And I am very pleased to report that these new products have been gaining traction. Bookings in Q3 for our Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector services were up 30% over Q2 and up more than fourfold over Q3 of last year. Our new enterprise security customers include leading companies such as one of the largest banks in the UK, a $10 billion travel company, a $4 billion luxury fashion brand, two of the world's leading consulting firms and a $30 billion media company. We believe that our new enterprise security offerings are gaining traction because they provide the core capabilities needed for a zero-trust security architecture. It's called zero-trust because enterprises can no longer assume that any device or employee on their internal network is trustworthy, as because employees sometimes click on the wrong link and accidentally import malware, which can then lead to a very costly data breach. As a result, we've seen growing interest in new architectures that protect internal applications by granting access at the application layer instead of the network layer. This approach avoids exposing corporate networks through a VPN and eliminates the need to manage complex network firewall rules. As the value of such a disruptive solution becomes apparent to more customers, we expect the adoption of our new enterprise security services to continue their rapid growth. We've also integrated our market leading Kona Site Defender technology into our zero-trust solution. So that if an employee or internal device is compromised, we can help prevent the infection from spreading to other enterprise applications or from gaining access to sensitive data, and as an added benefit for global companies, we can also integrate our Ion solution to substantially improve the performance of enterprise applications for employees around the world. Turning to our divisional results for the quarter, Web Division customers generated $357 million in revenue in the third quarter, up 9% in constant currency over Q3 of last year with continued strong traction for our new products such as mPulse, Image Manager and Bot Manager. We've been seeing positive results by offering bundled solutions to customers that want the ability to leverage multiple Akamai products. Bundles that combine our security and performance products have proven to be especially popular, and they also provide a strong advantage over competitors that have only point solutions or rudimentary security capabilities. Revenue for our Media and Carrier Division in Q3 was $313 million, up 7% in constant currently over Q3 of last year. Traffic growth remain very strong in our OTT and gaming sectors and was higher than published reports in the Internet as a whole. Growing traffic faster than the Internet as a whole means that we continue to gain share. In fact to meet the increasing demand from our customers, we added about as much traffic in the past year alone as the total capacity claimed by many of our competitors. As you know, some of these competitors are preparing to go public or trying to be sold. In such circumstances, it's not uncommon for a company to take potshots with the established market leader, which in this case of course is Akamai. This kind of activity has been such a regular occurrence over the last 15 to 20 years that some analysts have referred to these companies as YAAKs, spelled Y-A-A-K, which stands for yet another Akamai killer. To be clear, we take all our competitors very seriously and we strive to take the high road when it comes to talking about the competition. In that spirit, I want to take a few minutes today to set the record straight on some of the things we understand competitors have been saying about us. One claim being made by the competition is that they're taking customers away from us. Of course, when you have many thousands of customers and well over $2.5 billion of revenue, there will always be some level of customer churn. But at Akamai, our churn rate is very low. In fact, our total competitive churn over the past year has amounted to a very low single-digit percentage of revenue. Moreover, our competitive churn rate declined over the past year. And in cases where we have lost customers to a competitor in the past, we found that many subsequently returned to Akamai because of our superior capabilities, such as the $10 billion retailer who came back to Akamai after they experienced Web performance issues and had security concerns with credential stuffing when using our competitors\u2019 services. Another claim we've heard is that our competition can offer comparable service for less. The reality is that our competitors can't match Akamai when it comes to reliability, performance, and scale. Just considered the way we delivered the recent World Cup tournament, where three of our largest competitors had glaring and well-publicized failures. Few of our competitors have security capabilities and we believe that none offer the level or breadth of protection provided by Akamai. And we don't rush features to market while making excuses like one competitor did last month when they acknowledge that their web gateway and browser extension needed more time to mature into a secure and reliable platform. Akamai customers don't want to wait for a secure and reliable platform and they don't have to. As noted by independent research firm IDC, Akamai\u2019s had the strongest and broadest edge security offering for quite some time. To deflect attention away from the immaturity of their platforms, some competitors say that our edge architecture is outdated or that they are centralized data centers are somehow superior. The reality is that we believe our edge architecture with the 240,000 servers that we positioned in 3,900 locations in more than 1,000 cities across 143 countries delivers vastly superior scale, performance and security. Our competitors simply don't have the scale or the reach to serve customers at the edge the way we do and you just can't do what we do with a few dozen or even a 100 points of presence. Our reach at the edge is why so many of the world's leading enterprises choose Akamai when it comes to delivering their media, accelerating their applications, and protecting their most important assets. We also believe that the competitive differentiation provided by our unique edge architecture will become even more important in the future as traffic volumes increased by a factor of 10 to 100 or more as billions of devices get connected and the cyber attacks increase in size and sophistication. The core of the Internet just doesn't have the scale or proximity to end users and devices to keep up with ever increasing demands. The edge of the Internet is where our customers connect with their end users and that is where their digital experiences must be fast, intelligent, and secure. It's gratifying that the analyst community is now embracing the importance of our edge architecture. Gartner recently published a report titled The Edge Will Eat the Cloud, which predicts that while cloud providers will extend their models closer to the edge, the architecture of the edge will be driven more by technologies that already have physical edge footprints. Akamai pioneered the edge platform, and we've been building upon it for 20 years, giving us a physical edge footprint that we believe is virtually impossible to replicate. For years, our competitors have been saying this, being at the edge didn't matter. Now, some have started using the word edge in the naming of their solutions. There is an enormous difference between saying you're at the edge and actually being there, and it shows up on the quality and security of your solutions. In our view, no amount of renaming can change the fact that our competitors are bound by the limitations of their centralized models. Some new entrants claim to have leapfrogged us in terms of their technology. The reality is that Akamai has an excellent track record when it comes to technology, leadership and market transforming innovation. Akamai pioneered edge computing as part of our edge suite service over 15 years-ago. We've extended our edge platform to the client and added the capabilities necessary to support the Internet of Things. And today, we are building a blockchain platform that's designed to perform more than a million transactions a second. The amount we invest in R&D on an annual basis is more than many of our competitors annual revenue. We have more engineers innovating than most competitors have in total headcount. And we've also made smart acquisitions that we believe have enhanced our offerings and have delivered strong value to our customers and shareholders, including Cyberfend in Bot Management, Nominum in Security, Soha in Enterprise Security, and SOASTA in Performance Management. We have also made it much easier for developers and admins to use our services and to build amazing digital experiences for their customers. Over 1,000 developers in 24 cities attended our recent DevOps world tour, where we received very favorable feedback for the significant enhancements we've made in our developer experience. Competitors don't invest as much as we do an innovation. So we've been told that they say our infrastructure is costly and inefficient. The reality is that each business that Akamai runs on the same, Akamai intelligent edge platform, which gives us excellent leverage in terms of cost. For example, last quarter, we decreased our overall spend on bandwidth and Colo, while delivering significantly more traffic than we did a year-ago. Our advances in software have helped us to reduce the amount we spend on network CapEx to less than 6% of revenue. In Q3 our gross margins were 77%, EBITDA margins were 41% and operating margins were 27%. We challenge any competitor who calls our platform inefficient to show you anything close to our margins and profitability. Looking across the competitive landscape, I don't see anyone in the marketplace I'd want to trade places with. It's not even close. We're the market leader in Media Delivery, application acceleration, DDoS prevention, Web application protection, and Bot management. But rest assured that we know that we can never be complacent and we will never stand still. We're committed to providing superior customer value in everything that we do and we intend to continue our great track record of innovative R&D, our success in bringing disruptive technologies to market and to providing our customers with exceptional services and support. In summary, I'm very pleased with our Q3 results, including the very strong performance in our security business that continued improvement and our Media and Carrier Division, the expansion of our margins for the fourth quarter in a row, and the excellent growth on the bottom line. I'll now turn it over to Jim to review our financials and guidance to the rest of the year. Jim? James Benson : Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom outlined, Akamai had another strong quarter, exceeding the high-end of our guidance on revenues, operating margins and earnings and delivering substantial operating margin improvement for the fourth consecutive quarter. We continue to execute well and demonstrate the leverage in Akamai\u2019s operating model and we have growing competence we both have a path to and can achieve our goal of 30% non-GAAP operating margins in 2020. Moving to our strong third quarter results, revenue came in above the high-end of our guidance range at $670 million, up 7% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency, and up 10% in constant currency if you exclude the six large Internet Platform Customers. Notably, this is the third straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth when you exclude the Internet platform giants. Revenue growth with solid across the business, with the primary overachievement compared to guidance driven by an acceleration in growth for our security solutions and higher media traffic volume than we anticipated going into the quarter. Revenue from Media and Carrier Division customers was $313 million in the third quarter, up 6% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency and up a healthy 12% in constant currency, excluding the large Internet Platform Customers. Revenue from the Internet Platform Customers was $43 million in the third quarter, roughly consistent with Q2 levels and in line with our expectations. It is important to note the Internet Platform Customers now only represent 6% of total Akamai revenues. The lowest level of such customer concentration in memory and a testament to our continued progress on diversifying our revenue base across customers, solutions, and geographies. Media Division revenue and traffic outside the Internet giant continue to be strong across the core installed base with particularly robust growth coming from our gaming and video delivery verticals. Our Media and Carrier Division management team remains focused on capturing more traffic share and improving the quality of delivery for the top 250 media customers that account for most of our traffic and revenue. We continue to be pleased with the revenue acceleration associated with our traffic capture efforts over the past several quarters. In addition to traffic gains in media, we are also very pleased with the continuous security growth in the Media Division. As Tom highlighted in his earlier remarks, security is a key differentiator versus our competition and that is true in the Media Division as well. Moving now to our Web Division, revenue for this set of customers was $357 million, up 8% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency and consistent with Q2 growth levels. We continued to see a very strong uptake in our new product areas, namely Image Manager, Digital Performance Management, and Bot Manager as well as further strong growth and adoption of our core Kona and Prolexic Cloud Security Solutions. Turning now to our results for our Cloud Security Solutions, third quarter revenue was $169 million, up 37% year-over-year or 39% in constant currency, and yet another quarter of tremendous revenue growth and customer adoption for our Cloud Security Solutions globally. We are particularly pleased to see accelerating revenue growth and our security offerings in Q3 from both the Web and Media Division customer base. Entering the fourth quarter, our Cloud Security business now as an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $700 million and represents over a quarter of our total revenues. We believe security remains a significant growth opportunity for us and we plan to continue to invest in this area with a focus on further enhancing our product portfolio and extending our go-to-market capabilities. Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented over 38% of total revenue in Q3, up slightly from Q2 levels. International revenue was $257 million in the third quarter, up 21% year-over-year with 24% in constant currency driven by continued strong growth in our Asia Pacific region and a solid quarter in our EMEA region. Due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $6 million on a sequential basis and $5 million on a year-over-year basis. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market, which $413 million consistent with Q2 levels. Moving onto costs, cash gross margin was 77%, up slightly from Q2 levels and up over a point from the same period last year. We continue to excel well on our platform efficiency initiatives. For the first time in memory, our bandwidth and co-location expenses on an absolute basis declined year-over-year despite the significant increase in traffic over the same period. And as we highlighted at our June Analyst Day, we have several ongoing platform efficiency initiatives in place intended to drive further improvements from current levels. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 64% roughly consistent with Q2 levels and up slightly from the same period last year. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $244 million, below the low-end of our guidance and down about $4 million from Q2 levels due to continued traction with our operational efficiency efforts. Notably, we are seeing some early progress in our cost transformation actions to better optimize and reduce third-party spend, particularly in IT. We expect additional improvements in this area as well as the other efficiency areas we outlined at our June Analyst Day. Moving out of profitability, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $273 million, up $11 million from Q2 levels in a $42 million or 18% from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in one point above the high-end of our guidance range as 41%, a one point improvement from Q2 levels and four points from the same period last year, with most of the strong achievement coming from the operational efficiency actions taken over the last 12 months. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $181 million, up $11 million from Q2 levels and up $34 million or 23% from the same period last year and growing nearly three times the rate of revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27% up over one point from Q2 levels, and also one point about the high end of our guidance range. I am very pleased with the four consecutive quarters of margin expansion we have seen as a result of our ongoing efficiency efforts and we believe our continued hard work will drive further operating margin improvements in Q4. Furthermore, we feel confident we can achieve our 30% non-GAAP operating margin goal in 2020, while continuing to make the required investments to drive both growth and further scale and leverage in the business. Moving now to CapEx, capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense for $125 million and in line with our guidance. As we mentioned when we set our guidance in July, Q3 included large facility build-outs in Bangalore and Costa Rica, integral investments in support of our ongoing efficiency efforts to align work to these lower cost centers of excellence. We are also early in the early phases of our new Cambridge headquarter built-out and we expect facility-related spend for that project to increase in Q4 and 2019. Moving on to earnings. Non-GAAP net income was $158 million or $0.94 of earnings per diluted share and growing 47% over the same period last year and coming in $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. These strong earnings results were driven by strong topline execution continued operating expense improvement and a lower tax rate. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $31 million based on a Q3 effective tax rate of 16.5%, which equates to a year-to-date effective tax rate of roughly 18.5%. This Q3 effective tax rate is 3.5 points lower than our guidance due primarily to our higher mix of foreign earnings and the resulting year-to-date true-up in the quarter. Moving on to GAAP earnings. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $108 million or $0.64 of earnings per diluted share and growing 73% from the same period last year. Now, I will review our use of capital. We continue to focus on the importance of returning capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we spent $440 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 6 million shares. For the year, we have spent $626 million of our $750 million 2018 authorization, which has resulted in our share count declining from 171 million shares at the beginning of the year to 168 million shares in the third quarter. We plan to be quite active in repurchasing shares in Q4 and spending at least the remaining $124 million by the end of 2018. Additionally, today we announced that our Board is authorizing new $1.1 billion share repurchase program running from November until the end of 2021. Going forward, we intend to continue returning to our shareholders a significant percentage of our free cash flow to share repurchases balanced against preserving our flexibility for other strategic opportunities. We believe this approach will allow us to continue driving shareholder value through investing organically in the business, pursuing additional M&A and returning capital to stockholders via sharing purchases. In summary, we are very pleased with our strong execution in Q3 and year-to-date. Looking to the fourth quarter, we are expecting another strong quarter on the top and bottom lines. As always holiday seasonality plays a large role in determining our financial performance for the fourth quarter, driven by online retail activity for our e-commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. As a result, the fourth quarter remains the hardest to predict. In addition, we expect further foreign exchange headwinds in Q4 from the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which has been notable in the last few weeks in particular. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q4 revenue of over $3 million compared to Q3 levels and an $8 million impact year-over-year. Taking into account, these foreign exchange headwinds combined with typical holiday seasonality, we are projecting Q4 revenue in the range of $692 million to $709 million. To frame this guidance range, which is slightly wider in Q4 due to seasonal variability, if the online holiday season is exceptionally strong, we would expect to be near the higher end of the revenue range. The online holiday season is not as strong, and we would expect to be towards the lower end of the range. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of roughly 78%, up one point from Q3 levels, and GAAP gross margins of 66%, up two points from Q3. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $254 million to $259 million, up from Q3 levels due primarily to a typical year end incentive compensation expenses. Factoring into cash gross margin and operating expense expectations that I just provided, we anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of 42%, up one point from Q3 levels. Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $94 million to $96 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 28% for Q4, up one point from Q3 levels, up four points from Q4 2017 and our fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.97 to $1.03 per share, and at the midpoint would represent 42% growth from the same period last year. EPS guidance expectations assume an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of roughly 19%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 165 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend $120 million to $130 million, excluding equity compensation in the quarter. This is consistent with Q3 levels as the facility build-out of our new Cambridge headquarter building begins to ramp up. And as I said earlier, we expect increased facility related spend for our new Cambridge headquarters in 2019. Incorporating in our Q4 guidance, for the full-year we are anticipating revenue of $2.693 billion to $2.71 billion, and at the midpoint, up $9 million from our previous guidance, despite increased foreign exchange headwinds. EBITDA and non-GAAP operating margins of 40% and 26%, respectively, and at the high-end of the revenue range, non-GAAP operating margin could possibly even around to 27% for the full-year, which would be up nearly three points from 2017 levels. In factoring in these revenue and margin levels and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of roughly 19%. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.53 to $3.59 for full-year 2018 and at the midpoint, up $0.24 from our previous full-year guidance. As a helpful reference, we will post our Q4 and full-year 2018 guidance ranges on the Investor Relations section of our website after this call. In closing, we are very optimistic about the opportunities ahead for Akamai. We are confident in our ability to continue innovating and leveraging the Akamai\u2019s platform for new customer use cases. To achieve 30% operating margins in 2020 and to execute against the new $1.1 billion share buyback authorization over the next three years, all three, which we believe will add significant shareholder value over both the near-term and long-term. Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter. I wanted to dig into the security business. [I assume that] the real outperformance, the real highlight the most recent quarter. Two questions for you. One, how should we think about the sustainability of growth? You saw nice acceleration in overall growth, but that had been declining trend line, do you think we're sort of back on an accelerating trend line today? And is there enough breadth of product so to sustain that accelerating trend line? And then the second question comes in terms of investment. I think one of the key investor debates is whether given sort of the drive for higher operating margins, you're going to be able to invest enough in this business in terms of increased distribution, increased product and what is the really competitive space out there? How do we grow in our confidence that you guys are going to have the flexibility to invest aggressively enough behind this opportunity? Thank you. Thomson Leighton : Yes. So we're pretty excited about the future potential for the security business. Today that revenue and almost all the growth is associated with our Kona Site Defender and Prolexic products now with Bot Management, being one of our most successful new products ever. And so that is the existing base. Bot Manager has a long way to go for growth, which is great. And then as we\u2019ve talked about on the call with our approach to enabling a zero-trust architecture, that's pretty much brand new and we're at the early stage of bookings, seeing them ramp substantially should start really making a difference with the revenue we report in 2019 and 2020. And in the long run that has probably more potential than the existing business, which is already driving $700 million annual run rate and growing in the high 30s. So I think as you look to the future, there's a ton of runway for our security business and we're in a great position there. Now in terms of your second question, ability to invest. Yes, I do believe that we can continue to make the margin improvement we talked about, get to 30% in 2020 and still be able to make the investments we need in security. And part of that is being very careful with how we spend our OpEx. And as you can tell, we've made great progress in the efficiency of our platform. We delivered a ton more traffic this year than last year, the dollars we spent to do that with bandwidth and Colo actually declined. And that generates a lot of cash for us and we're focusing a lot of our investment to grow the security business. So I think with careful management of OpEx and fantastic product set and capabilities there, we got a long way to go with security growth. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi Guys. I'm going to go the other way. So if I look inside the Web Division and strip out security, the remainder of that segment I think saw the same kind of performance as we did last quarter, down about the same amount sequentially. And I think last quarter you called out competition and a few other items. I'm just wondering if you can go into a little bit more color and detail as to what you experienced specifically there and what you anticipate will happen through the end of the year? Thomson Leighton : Yes, the performance products are performing comparable to last quarter. As we talked about last quarter, there's some pressure on our customers in that segment of commerce and retail. They've got \u2013 their hands full with some of the cloud giants in terms of competition for their businesses. That puts pressure on in terms of what they can spend. There's price pressure there. We talked about that last quarter with prices coming down a little bit faster than traffic is growing there, and so the performance products, a little bit of a flat business. As we also talked about, we're packaging our product, security and performance products together. And in some cases that means something that might have been, a small amount of performance revenue might now get counted as part of the security bundle because these packages are being driven by our customers demand for security products. Jim, you want to add to that? James Benson : Maybe only other thing that I would add is that we've had \u2013 as we talked about on the last call that one of the go-to-market areas that we really focusing on is new customer acquisition. And in particular, we actually had a really strong quarter in Q3 on new customer acquisition in the Web Division actually up over 30% from Q2 level. So we're starting to get traction on new customer acquisition. As we talked to you about in the past, we\u2019ve done exceptionally well as a company of expanding our offerings into the installed base, as evidenced by a lot of the new product traction that we have made, I think in Q2 with $170 million run rate business on an annualized basis, and it's over $220 million in Q3, so great progress on selling more to the installed base. The area that we had some work to do was around new customer acquisition and we were quite pleased with the traction that we made in the quarter. So I think Tom is right. [There\u2019s always areas] to the portfolio that are doing better than others that we\u2019re pretty optimistic that the actions that we have in place between new customers, pricing and packaging, new product upsell that those are the right sets of actions to drive performance improvement for the company. And I think what it also does as we talked about at the Investor Day is Akamai\u2019s revenue streams are so much more diversified now. So our strategy around investing both organically and through M&A to broaden the solution base, to broaden the customer base, and expand further into new geographies, I think is a strategy that I think is the right strategy for the company to accelerate growth. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sameet Sinha from B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open. Sameet Sinha : Yes. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. So your 30% target for pro forma operating income by 2020, can you talk about the interim? I remember during the Investor Summit that you had, you spoke about more investments into DevOp tools and internal systems. So kind of \u2013 I was just trying to get a cadence for how margins would expand into 2020? And secondly, in the CDN business, can you talk about pricing? I know you were kind of targeting these top 250 customers. You're going to be tactical about pricing. If you can talk about that and contrasts with what you're seeing in the kind of low-end performance business? Thank you. James Benson : Sure. On the margin expansion front, we're very, very pleased. Actually the progress we've made this year to be frank is exceeded our expectations. So ending Q3 to 27% operating margins guiding 28% for Q4 that we talked a little bit about that at the June Analyst Day around the areas that we are driving. And it's a bit of a follow-up to Tom's point around. I think it was key to ask the question around, can we make the investments we think we need while including margins? I think it's important to remember that the areas that we're targeting is some level of improvement we\u2019re expecting in gross margins and you're already starting to see that. But we also talked a lot about the areas we're going after significant margin improvements really in G&A, it's not in R&D, and so that's not an area that we're going to be scaling back on. There might be some areas of R&D that we can get some better efficiency out of, but the primary areas we're looking for scale or in G&A. We talked about what some of those areas are. We've already begun to get some traction in third-party procurement spend within our IT function in particular and we expect significantly more to be had there. We also expect some improvements in the go-to-market space as we drive more productivity per dollar we spend in sales and marketing. So I'm pretty bullish about where we're at. And so, you think about where we're at, this is almost \u2013 if we hit the high-end of our range here, you could almost be operating at 27% operating margins, which is a 300 bps improvement from where we were in 2017. So we're well on our way to 30%. And there's a lot more work to be done. We've only begun to see the benefit some of the actions that we've taken. And your second question around media. As we talked about in the past, the pricing environment in the media business is highly competitive and so that hasn't changed. It's a very competitive pricing environment, but the pricing environment hasn't changed really in the last quarter. It remains competitive, but not kind of better or worse than it was. I'd say in Q2. And it varies obviously based on customer and the amount of traffic that they pushed and the expected price point that they're looking for. But in general, the pricing environment is aggressive, but unchanged from Q2. Sameet Sinha : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Van Rhee from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. Jeff Van Rhee : Great. Thanks. So a couple for me. Just to the \u2013 back to the website for a second. I mean, we don't have the 2019 outlook yet, but is there any way you can just sort of frame for us from this 9% constant currency over the last couple of quarters? What are the puts and takes to drive that to acceleration? What would it take for that to decelerate? Just you gave us a kind of a great taste for Q4 around the seasonality and how you\u2019re thinking behind at a low range for the low-end of the range? Just I realize it's early, but any thoughts you can give us on how that line should behave in 2019? James Benson : Yes. I mean, we're not going to talk about 2019 on this call. We will provide a lot more color on 2019 in the February call. But I do think that some of what we outlined at the June Analyst Day and we talked a bit about just now, which is Web growth is about a few areas. It's about new product upsell, so there's a lot more room to grow there. We\u2019re not nearly penetrated with the new products that we've introduced. There is a lot more rooms for new product upsell. Tom mentioned pricing and packaging. This is packaging multiple products to customers. It makes us stickier with customers because you have a value proposition that competitors can't match. New customer acquisition is a big one. That is an area that we had room for improvement and early days still, but we're getting traction in new customer acquisition. And so that's really the focus, obviously there's new areas that Tom Highlighted, Internet of Things being one, Blockchain being another. So there's enough catalysts for between existing products that we have that we're not penetrating new customers and then new emerging areas, to drive growth in the Web Division. Jeff Van Rhee : Got It. And then my last, as it relates to sales and sort of sales structure, sales headcount. I think you had talked on the website particular, I think around security you are going to be putting money into products and in go-to-market can just spend a second and just touch on sales and sales structure with respect to what \u2013 where are you with headcount, where are you adding heads, where are you reallocating heads, just some sort of context of what the headcount and growth rates look like there? Thomson Leighton : Yes, I mean we don't comment specifically on our sales and marketing or sales headcount. I can tell you that in particular for the Web Division, as you can imagine that we do have a specialty salesforce that is there support, our enterprise sales account leaders that have security expertise, they have enterprise security expertise in some cases they have expertise in particular domain areas and so we have a model where obviously the enterprise rep needs to be proficient in selling certain offerings and then they have a model of basically specialist support on top of that. That is an area that we actually have kind of an outside consulting firm that's helping us; look at tuning the model, tuning the models to drive maybe acceleration in new customer acquisition, maybe through a more enhanced new customer motion. And then in particular trying to drive more velocity, the existing sales reps that we do have and some of that has to do with better leveraging the specialty model, possibly consolidating components of this specialty model. So that's generally what the Web Division salesforce looks like. It's a little bit different on the media side. The media side, obviously the bulk of the revenue in the media business is traffic related revenue. So less of a \u2013 kind of an overlay model, although they do also get support from security and as I mentioned and Tom mentioned, a huge progress on selling security into the Media Division customer base we expect that to continue. Jeff Van Rhee : And with respect to the outside consultant firm, sort of tuning the model, just any quick thoughts on what's a realistic expectation to start to see the results of those changes? Thomson Leighton : Well, you'll see it show up in a couple of ways. One, you will see it show up and kind of modest improvement with sales or marketing spend as a percent of revenue. And then if we execute well, you'll see in the form of an acceleration of revenue growth. I think you know, that the Web Division is different than the Media Division where its catalyst is selling more sales transaction does not necessarily, having traffic and having the right customers that push traffic and then following that, you guys sell more to them. And so, it'll take more to get Web Division growth accelerated as far as the timeframe is concerned, but you'll see it show up if we execute well both in more improvement with sales and marketing as a percent of revenue and an acceleration and revenue growth. Jeff Van Rhee : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turits from Raymond. Your line is now open. Michael Turits : Hey, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter and solid guide. Two questions, one, about the CDN product grouping, which did the sell down to 1% from 3% of this quarter. And I know it includes both performance and the media as well as download, so what the drivers were there. And then as we go into next year, and obviously you're not giving guidance, but to the extent you can talk about both the positives and the negatives, because there are some headwinds and going into next year, including getting past Nominum, lapping a lot of the out winds of the 250 top customers and more effects? James Benson : Yes, I think certainly, Michael, I'd say the growth moderate a bit from Q2 to Q3 and the CDN other category, and talked a little bit about that that a lot of focus on security as Tom outlined. Some of that also as we saw packaging products that that is becoming kind of a little bit of blurry distinction because you're packaging performance with security as part of some of the offerings and so with an element of that. And as we said, we\u2019re starting to see the salesforce sell more of our security offerings and what tends to happen is when you start to have something that they get traction and that's what they tend to sell more of them. We're starting to see that. In relative to 2019, we'll share more of that in February. I think you're right that there are some things that you're going to anniversary that Nominum acquisition that actually happened this quarter as a matter of fact that we had them for a month in Q4. And then we know that there's variability in events in the media business that you tend to have more events and in even years than you do odd years. But there's a lot of variability in the media business that it's not just events, events still drive while they are a catalyst for some level of traffic, there's a lot of things in the media business that we've talked about that if there's continued secular tailwinds in gaming, continued secular tailwinds with more and more traffic moving online as far as video delivery. So there's a lot of catalysts for growth in the media business. So it's kind of \u2013 I'm not going to provide guidance here. But yes, there are some headwinds that you had outlined. But they're also a lot of tailwind opportunities just from a secular perspective in that business. Michael Turits : I\u2019d say I don\u2019t know if I don\u2019t want to argue, but maybe at some point, I'd love to hear you talk more about edge and particularly, what you guys can be doing to enable developer activity on your platform? That's just an interesting topic to me. Thomson Leighton : Yes, well already we now have the capability for developers in parallel at even a given company to make changes on the fly, test them out. We have an edge container for them and they can do it on the edge platform. So it's a very nice thing in terms of DevOps for our larger customers have lots of developers making changes simultaneously on their website and be able to do this in a safe and efficient way. Just in terms of DevOps on our edge platform, of course the edge platform is important for so many other reasons, the capacity to deliver large amounts of video at high quality, the capacity to absorb giant denial of service attacks, the data that we get at the edge from conducting so many of the world's transactions and main server lookups being close to end users and all the devices, both through application performance, mobile performance and the Internet of Things, where you've got to be managing metadata within milliseconds of the devices, the edge is important for all of those reasons. Michael Turits : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from James Fish from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. James Fish : Hey, guys congrats on a great quarter. Maybe just to start it off, I guess what inning in the Web performance and security bundling story are we in. In other words, what is the percentage of customers that have both now? And then going back to the margin questions from before? Should we still expect a hockey stick like acceleration and margin expansion in between now and 2020 or a more linear one? Thanks. Thomson Leighton : Yes. So on Web performance and security that probably has to do with actually more recent packaging to be frank, literally over the last call it six months to nine months. And so I think there are a lot more room to grow as far as bundling security with performance. Not just for existing customers, but it's also an attractive option to get new customers on the platform because they get both security and performance at the same time. And so I think there's certainly an opportunity there. And as we talked about at the Analyst Day, although to be frank, our margin expansion in 2018 really have surpassed our expectations even at the Analyst Day. We talked a little bit about the fact that it wouldn't necessarily be linear, that you wouldn't necessarily see a linear progression from where margins were to getting to 2020. Obviously you've seen here 300 bps, possibly of improvement from 2017 to 2018. So if you assume we're called 26.5% for 2018, you basically have 350 bps to get to 30% in 2020. It probably won't be linear in 2019. Having said that, there will be progress in 2019, so we\u2019ll not flatline, we will make continued progress in 2019, but it probably won't be linear. So you probably won't necessarily have 175 bps improvements in 2019, but you will get improvement in 2019. And some of that is because a lot of the actions that we're taking a very smart and very measured. We're implementing changes in third-party spend. We're building out a global procurement function instead of capabilities. We're putting in place process standardization and automation in our G&A functions for critical tasks. We're kind of revamping our go-to-market model in specific areas. And these are items that take a little bit of time to put in place. They're going to see that a lot of that infrastructure is going to be put in place in 2019 and you'll get the bigger benefit for that in 2020 to improve the efficiency. So there is a path to get there. And there is a path to get there with varying levels of revenue growth for the company. So we're pretty confident in our ability to get there. James Fish : Got it. Thanks. And then, Tom, appreciate the competitive overview. Is there any way that you guys can provide us any sort of new customer expansion metrics or dollar-based retention rates like some of your peers do to just get a better understanding of what's going on there? It really \u2013 what I'm trying to get at is how the stickiness of the Akamai platform has evolved since the company took a more aggressive step on the bundling that we've been talking about here. Thomson Leighton : Yes. We don\u2019t release the detailed statistics. But as I mentioned earlier, our competitive churn rate is incredibly low, very single-digit on an annual basis and actually declined year-over-year. So we're very pleased with our customer retention. Jim, do you want to add to that at all? James Benson : No, I think you said it well in your comments, but I would have anything else to add. James Fish : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Kvaal : Yes, thanks very much. I'd like to follow-up on the security growth in the media side of the business if I could. Would you all mind shedding a little bit more light on what has changed in that side of the business to drive security growth, and what products are they buying and what should we think about for I mean how sustainable is that? Thank you. Thomson Leighton : Yes. They're buying the same products, and in fact, we have a couple of very large media accounts, some of the first large adopters of our zero-trust solutions for the enterprise security. So I would say media companies are like other verticals in terms of having a real need for security. And of course a lot of the headlines you read for data breaches some of those are big media companies. The only thing that makes media different is that there's a smaller number of really big customers that drive media revenue overall and media revenue overall tends \u2013 the majority of that is driven by their traffic, the traffic in the top 250 global media brands. But they are big consumers of security. Jeffrey Kvaal : Should we expect that the pieces of the security business to move at the same rhythm and pace as the typical sort of performance side of that business? Thomson Leighton : I'm not sure the question there. Our security products aren't traffic-based by and large, so the dynamic in our media company would be your \u2013 bulk of your revenue is driven by the traffic and the price of the traffic. And the security products can even be about a fixed price nature in some cases. Maybe, I didn't answer your question? Jeffrey Kvaal : No, that was it Tom. Thank you. James Benson : Okay. The only thing I would add is that, we still have a little over 40% of our customers buy one of our security products. But we are more \u2013 that\u2019s a total company comment, but we are more penetrated in the web division. I mean we certainly have a lot more room to grow in the Web Division. We are not nearly as concentrated on security in the Media Division, so they make great traction. And one thing Tom didn't comment on is that the Media Division sales team put in place a pretty clever incentive compensation programs really drive security and we're seeing huge benefit from that in 2018. So I expect further progress in security and the Media Division here over the coming quarters. Jeffrey Kvaal : Thank you both very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Vijay Bhagavath : Yes, thanks. Hey Tom, Jim, interesting call here. A quick question on Tom, I wanted to get you a bigger picture views on growing topline in particular in performance and in the CDN business, both of which know came in light versus expectations. And then Jim, any concerns that you might be running the business near peak margins? Do not 42 points of EBITDA margin on the guidance? Thank you. Thomson Leighton : Yes. So we very much like our CDN business and it has a lot of room for growth. I think the big drivers there obviously OTT video, seeing very strong growth there. Gaining, really strong growth set major records with the Fortnite the various Fortnite releases. So I think there's a lot of room for growth in the CDN business. Of course on the performance side as you move more apps into the mobile environment, performances especially challenging there. People want to their sites to be more interactive, richer, have video now. We're broadening our Image Manager product to be Video Manager products. You can have short video clips on your commerce site. So performance continues to be a challenge for our customers there and I think in the long run, that's a very good business for us. Jim, you want to talk about margin? James Benson : Yes, I mean, I think the actions we've taken over the last 12 months are manifesting themselves in the results you're seeing. Put some headcount actions for the Company in Q4 and Q1 the big focus of that really was a pretty deep inspection around some R&D areas that we weren't generating the level of return that we wanted. So you're seeing that manifests itself in the P&L You're starting to see some early traction and some of the efficiency efforts outside of that. I mentioned third-party procurement spend being one, like I mentioned in the last call, facility consolidation being another. And so I wouldn't say we're operating at peak margin, obviously we showed good progress. I think we have a lot more room for expansion. Of course, you got to make sure that you're investing wisely in the areas they're going to continue to drive growth and scale for the company. And we think we're doing that, we're making the right prioritization tradeoffs, but I still think we can drive further margin expansion and make the investments in the business that I needed. Vijay Bhagavath : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question. Our next question is from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much for fitting me and congrats on great results guys. So the security results are really impressive, but the stats that you shared around your zero trust solutions are even more impressive? Can you maybe give us a sense of the sales dynamic in the field, the length of these cycles and who do you find yourselves most competing with? Thomson Leighton : It's very early days in zero-trust, and so I would say most enterprises see sales aren't there yet. But you're seeing the first wave and it comes across many verticals, which is really exciting prospect for us, we have the early adopters that they get it. They understand that the traditional model of building a moat around the castle or putting in the VPN in the firewall just doesn't cut it. It's just way too easy for somebody to click on the wrong link even when they're not in the company, when they're on the outside, bring the device on the inside and you\u2019re dead. Before you know it, you got a major data breach. And so the notion of authenticating somebody that network layer, I think people are starting to realize it doesn't work. You can't get the security you need, plus have a big overhead with a lot of costs and instead by authenticating at the application layer, now you would get access on an app-by-app basis and then you can add in our Kona Site Defender that's fantastic. Much more secure and we've had some really great proof points among the early adopters of catching infections that were inside, devices on the inside that were infected, they were trying to ex-filtrate data that they just didn't know about. So we're in the early days, we have a now over a couple hundred customers, some major brands using it and you see our bookings really accelerating now. So we're very excited about the future there. And they're still a long way to go either it's not going to be next year that all enterprise, suddenly decide they're going to totally change their security posture. But you are seeing the leaders now start to do that and that's exciting. Brad Zelnick : Thanks Tom. It makes a ton of sense to us. And if I could just sneak in one last question here. We've heard folks in the industry starting to talk about customers implementing multi-sourcing strategies and performance similar to what we've seen in media in the past. To what extent are you seeing this and how do you expect that plays out? Thomson Leighton : A little of it and sometimes \u2013 what we're really seeing is if there's sites or apps that don't matter that the customer has. They will sometimes source that with a competitor. But for apps and sites that matter in our base those would be Akamai. And in addition, if the app or site matters, you got to secure it. And you can't secure it with most all the other providers out there or at least not to the level that you need to. And so in fact, that's why the bundle is so helpful and a real competitive advantage. And in many cases the sale is led by security and the delivery or the performance comes with the product or comes in the bundle, so that I think makes a big difference. It's not just an issue, hey, there's very few cases where you say, I'm going to split this site with two vendors. Now you do get that in video or media. You don't really see that on the website. You'll see some of the apps that don't matter as much or you don't care about securing, those might be given to our competitor that we'll see some of that out there. And again bundling, I think can be a good defense against that as well. Brad Zelnick : Great. Tom, thanks again for taking my questions. James Benson : Thank you. End of Q& A Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations for closing remarks. Tom Barth : Thank you. In closing, we will be participating at several investor conferences and events throughout the end of the year. We hope to see you at some of those and those events can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. So thank you for joining us this evening and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and our instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. It is now my pleasure hand the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Tom Barth : Thank you, Bryan, and good afternoon, everyone, and we appreciate you joining Akamai's fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2018 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 12, 2019. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks Tom. And thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $713 million up 8% over Q4 2017 and up 10% in constant currency. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1.07 per diluted share up 51% year-over-year and up 52% in constant currency. These very strong results were driven by the continued rapid growth of our security business; the continued improvement in our media and carrier division; and a robust holiday commerce season in our Web Division. Our bottom-line also benefited from a lower tax rate and from our continued focus on operational excellence. EBITDA margins in Q4 expanded to 42% and non-GAAP operating margins expanded to 28%. Q4 marked our fifth consecutive quarter of increasing margins and we anticipate further margin expansion in 2019. We also have clear line of sight to achieving non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while continuing to invest in innovation and new products to drive our future growth. For the full year, revenue was $2.7 billion up 9% over the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS for 2018 was $3.62 up a $1 or 38% over 2017. We're especially pleased to report that we generated over $1 billion in cash from operations last year. This was up 26% over 2017 and represented 37% of our revenue. In Q4, our security portfolio continued to be the fastest growing part of our business with revenue of $185 million up a very strong 38% year-over-year in constant currency. Security accounted for 26% of our total revenue last quarter and our Security business exited 2018 with a revenue run rate of $750 million per year. We now expect our security business to top the $1 billion mark in annualized revenues in 2020. That's a remarkable milestone, but we're not planning to stop there. With our acquisition of Janrain which closed on January 23, and the development of our new Zero Trust Enterprise Security Solution, we anticipate that our security business will continue to grow at a very fast pace for many years to come. Janrain establishes Akamai as a market leader in the customer identity and access management space. Their solutions are designed to manage user log-ins and data for major consumer facing Web sites. They verify the identity of the end-user and make sure that the user experience is optimized and secure. Janrain does this in part by keeping track of how users access their accounts. For example, which devices they use and from which locations. We believe that we can use this data to help strengthen all our security solutions. And by combining Janrain's technology with our Bot Manager Solution, we believe that we can make it even harder for attackers to hack into or steal user accounts. Janrain will also help us protect enterprises from data breaches. That's because Janrain stores user information so that the enterprise doesn't have to. And if an enterprise doesn't keep user information like user names, passwords, phone numbers and addresses then it can't be stolen from that enterprise in a data breach. Keeping user data safe means more than just not having it stolen. It also means complying with the various data privacy laws that are being adopted by governments around the world. And it means helping end users have more control over who gets access to their data and what they can do with it. This is going to be increasingly important in the future and we believe that our unique security solutions can help position Akamai as a company that can be trusted in a world where big tech companies are being called out for their questionable uses of personal information. As we look forward, we're also excited about our new Zero Trust Enterprise Security Solution. Last quarter, we signed our first Zero Trust deal worth more than $1 million per year. And we sold it to a manufacturer in Asia. Now as most of you know manufacturing is not a vertical known for buying our traditional Web services but manufacturing companies do care about cyber security and protecting their enterprise. And the same is true for just about every major company today. And so, with our enterprise security solutions, we see an opportunity to dramatically expand the range of companies that we can serve. And since companies typically spend more on enterprise security than they do on Web security, we expect this emerging business to have a more meaningful impact on our revenue beginning in 2020. We're also continuing to invest in other innovative technologies that could bring substantial future returns. For example, today we announced a new joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan. The joint venture will offer a new block chain based online payment platform called Global Open Network or GO-NET for short. GO-NET is designed to enable next generation digital financial transactions to be scalable, fast, efficient and secure. The new platform is expected to become available in the first half of 2020. We were also very pleased to see the continued improvement in our media and carrier business in Q4. Traffic growth last quarter remain very strong in our OTT and gaming sectors. And in December, we achieved another record for peak traffic driven by software downloads from Microsoft and Fortnight and streaming of the UEFA Champions League. We continue to grow traffic faster than the Internet as a whole in Q4, which means that we continued to gain share and because of our relentless focus on efficiency, we actually spend less on network costs in 2018 than we spent in the prior year. Overall, we're very pleased with the progress we made last year. We accelerated revenue growth. We made dramatic improvements to our margins. We grew non-GAAP EPS by nearly 40%. We developed innovative new technology that we believe will drive substantial revenue growth in the future. And we delivered excellent value to our customers further decreasing our already low customer churn rate. And we managed to do all this while keeping Akamai a great place to work where corporate social responsibility is a strong part of our culture. For example, we rank as one of the Forbes just 100 companies doing right by treating workers and customers well, protecting privacy, producing quality products, minimizing our environmental impact, giving back to our communities and by providing ethical leadership. We rank as one of the best employers for diversity out of 50,000 U.S. firms with more than 1000 employees. And we scored a perfect 100 on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of the talented employees on our global team for all their hard work on behalf of our customers and shareholders in 2018, because of their continued innovation and great customer service, Akamai is very well positioned for the years ahead. I also want to take this opportunity to say a special thank you to Jim Benson. As you may have seen in today's press release, Jim is planning to retire from Akamai later this year. And he'll be transitioning his CFO duties to Ed McGowan in March. Jim has been a great CFO and I'm very grateful to him for his many contributions to Akamai's growth and future success. Over the last 10 years, Jim has developed an outstanding finance organization and he's instilled a strong operational and financial discipline across the company. He's been a great business partner not only for me, but for the entire Akamai senior leadership team and the Board. His many contributions to Akamai will be fondly remembered for many years to come. Although Jim is stepping out of the CFO role after filing the 10-K in March, I'm very pleased that you'll be staying on as an Executive Advisor to help ensure a smooth transition. While we're sad to see Jim leave, we're also delighted about Ed's promotion to CFO. Ed is a highly accomplished finance executive and an 18-year veteran of Akamai, with broad knowledge of our business, our customers and the industry. He began his career with us in finance and sales operations. And then, took on executive roles in Corporate Development and Global Media and Carrier sales. Most recently Ed served as SVP in Finance, overseeing business finance, customer revenue operations and FP&A as well as leading a key transformation project to drive increased levels of sustained profitable growth. Having worked closely with Ed for over a decade, I'm looking forward to benefiting from his experience and knowledge in the role of CFO as we work to deliver profitable growth for our shareholders in 2019 and beyond. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim to review our Q4 and 2018 results, and then, Ed will share our guidance for Q1 and 2019 as well as some preliminary thoughts about 2020. Jim? Jim Benson : Thank you for the kind words Tom, and good afternoon everyone. This is a great team here at Akamai and I am very proud of what we've accomplished over the last nine years. With revenues approaching $3 billion a year a rapidly growing security business with the $750 million annualized run rate, a more diversified portfolio that I believe positioned Akamai for long-term success, industry leading profitability and a consistent focus on managing the business for the long-term while delivering results in the near-term. As I approach my 10th year helping to lead and drive the business and after discussing my desire to make a change with Tom, I've decided this is the ideal time for Akamai to transition to the next CFO to lead our next phase of continued growth and expansion. The company has been demonstrating strong business results. We have a very talented finance team and bench in place and there are many exciting future growth opportunities ahead. I am very pleased to be turning the reins over to Ed McGowan, who I have worked with over the past nine years most recently as my Senior Vice President of Finance. I'm looking forward to helping Ed, Tom and the team in the near-term spending some more time with my family and considering my next professional challenge. I am confident that this transition will be seamless. With that, let me now dive into the details of our strong Q4 financial results. As Akamai -- as Tom outlined, Akamai continued to perform well and had an exceptional fourth quarter closing out a fantastic 2018. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance on revenues, operating margins and earnings and delivered substantial operating margin improvements for the fifth consecutive quarter. We continued to execute well and to demonstrate the leverage in Akamai's operating model. And we remain confident, we will show further progress in 2019 and have clear line of sight to achieve our goal of 30% operating margins in 2020. Q4 revenue came in above the high-end of our guidance range at $713 million up 8% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency or up a healthy 11%, if you exclude the six large Internet platform customers. Notably this is the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year double-digit revenue growth, when you exclude the Internet platform giants. Revenue growth continued to be solid across most of the business with the over achievement compared to guidance driven by the rapid growth of our security services. And higher than expected holiday season traffic in our media and commerce verticals notably. I mentioned on our last call that holiday season traffic would play a large role and where we would land relative to our fourth quarter guidance. And it did. Traffic was solid across our core installed base with particularly strong growth coming in our gaming over the top and commerce verticals. Revenue from our media and carrier division customers was $328 million in the fourth quarter up 8% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency and up a healthy 14% in constant currency excluding the large Internet platform customers. Revenue from the Internet platform customers was $43 million in the fourth quarter consistent with Q3 levels and in line with our expectations. Revenues from these customers continued to stabilize and represented just 6% of total Akamai revenues. Our lowest level of revenue concentration in recent memory and a testament to our continued progress on diversifying our revenue base across customers, solutions and geographies over the past several years. Moving now to our Web Division. Revenue from these customers was $385 million up 9% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency, a slight acceleration from Q3 levels driven by a strong online retail season for our e-commerce customers. We also continue to see a strong uptake in our new product areas namely Bot Manager, Image Manager and Digital Performance Management as well as further strong growth and adoption for our core security solutions. Turning now to our results for our security solutions, fourth quarter revenue was $185 million up 36% year-over-year with 38% in constant currency and yet another quarter of tremendous revenue growth from increased customer adoption of these solutions globally. We are particularly pleased to see continued strong revenue growth in our security offerings in Q4 and throughout full year 2018 from both the Web and Media division customer bases. Entering 2019, our rapidly growing security business now at an annualized revenue run rate of $750 million. As Tom mentioned, we believe security continues to present a tremendous growth opportunity for us and we plan to continue to invest in this area to further enhance and extend our product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities. Our recent entrance into Customer Identity and Access Management is a great example of how we're adding complementary capabilities to our world-class security offerings as well as acquiring additional enterprise sales talent. Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets continue to be strong and represented 39% of total revenue in Q4 up 1 point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $279 million in the fourth quarter up 20% year-over-year with 23% in constant currency driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region and another solid quarter in our EMEA region. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $3 million on a sequential basis and $8 million on a year-over-year basis. Finally, from our U.S. market, revenue was $434 million up 2% year-over-year and up 4% excluding our large Internet platform customers. Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 79% up nearly 2 points from Q3 levels in the same period last year and 1 point above our guidance due to higher revenues and improved network efficiencies. Not only is this the second consecutive quarter that our bandwidth and co-location dollar spend declined year-over-year, but absolute expenses for a full year 2018 were lower than 2017 spend as well. This is noteworthy given the significant increase in traffic over the same period. We are very pleased with our continued ability to efficiently manage network cost. GAAP gross margin which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 66% also up 2 points from Q3 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $262 million up $18 million from Q3 levels this was slightly above our guidance driven by increased year-end commission and bonus costs associated with the revenue over achievement. Moving now to profitability, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $301 million up $28 million from Q3 levels and up $56 million or 23% from the same period in 2017. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 42% up 1 point from Q3 levels up 5 points from Q4 2017 levels and in line with our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $201 million up $20 million from Q3 levels and $42 million or 26% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28% up 1 point from Q3 levels up 4 points from Q4 of last year and in line with our guidance range. I am very pleased with the five consecutive quarters of margin expansion we have seen from our ongoing efficiency efforts and feel confident, we can achieve our 30% non-GAAP operating margin goal in 2020, while continuing to make the required investments to drive both growth and further scale and leverage in the business. Capital expenditures in Q4 excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense are $125 million in line with our guidance for the quarter. For the full year 2018, capital expenses came in at 16% of revenue and in line with our long-term model range. Moving on to earnings, non-GAAP net income was $176 million or $1.07 of earnings per diluted share, $0.04 above the high-end of our guidance range. These strong earnings results were driven by continued top-line execution, ongoing network and operating expense efficiencies and a lower tax rate. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $32 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of just over 15%. This effective tax rate is a couple of points lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings and the resulting year-to-date true up in the quarter. For the full year, the 2018 non-GAAP tax rate was just under 18%. Moving on to our GAAP earnings. There was one noteworthy item impacting our Q4 GAAP results that I'd like to provide some color on. We recorded a $13 million restructuring charge in Q4 and we expect to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $10 million to $12 million in Q1. These charges are primarily related to workforce reductions of approximately 125 employees in January or about 2% of our total headcount. Also included in our restructuring charge are some small capitalized software impairments from decisions to deprioritize certain investment areas that have not achieved the commercial success and return on investment we expected. It is important to note these restructuring actions are being taken to enable some rebalancing of our investments, divesting in some areas, investing in others and to position the company to meet our long-term goals of continued growth and scale. Factoring in this GAAP-only restructuring charge, GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $94 million or $0.57 of earnings per share. Now, I'll review our use of capital. We continue to focus on the importance of returning capital to shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we spent $124 million on share repurchases buying back roughly 1.9 million shares. For the year, we spent $750 million buying back 10.2 million shares representing 124% of our free cash flow. And resulting in our share count declining from 171 million shares at the beginning of the year to 165 million shares in the fourth quarter. We now have $1.1 billion on our previously announced share repurchase authorization and going forward we intend to continue returning to our shareholders a significant percentage of our free cash flow through share repurchases balanced against our preserving our flexibility for other strategic opportunities. We believe our disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach will allow us to continue driving shareholder value through investing organically in the business, pursuing additional M&A like we recently completed with Janrain and returning capital to stockholders via share repurchases. In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and throughout 2018 and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long-term. I'd now like to turn the call over to Ed to cover the Q1 and 2019 guidance along with some initial thoughts on 2020. And again, I want to say how pleased I am to hand the reins to you. I know we are in good hands. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thanks Jim. It's been a pleasure working closely with you over the past nine years. I look forward to following your example of professionalism and business leadership in years ahead. Before I move on to guidance, there are three housekeeping items that I wanted to highlight. The first relates to a change in our network server useful lives as some of you may recall, we announced on our Q4 2012 earnings call that we were required to extend the useful life of our network servers from three years to four years based on the actual server useful life trends. We carefully monitor the useful lives of all of our capital assets annually and based on the outcome of that review; we now need to extend the useful lives of our network servers from four years to five years, similar to when we made the change six years ago. This extended useful life is a direct result of the continued software and hardware initiatives that we have put in place to manage our global network more efficiently because we are now using our servers in our network for an average of five years, we have determined it is appropriate under GAAP accounting to adjust our useful life policy to five years and this change will be effective in Q1. Please keep in mind this change has no impact on cash flow, but will result in roughly a $24 million depreciation benefit in 2019 and a benefit of approximately $7 million in 2020. We have provided a supplemental table in the Investor Relations section of our Web site that details the impact of this change. Also during Q1, we closed on our recently announced acquisition of Janrain. As we previously stated, Janrain will be approximately $0.05 to $0.06 dilutive to non-GAAP EPS in 2019. But, we expect it to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in 2020. Finally, just a reminder that our $690 million convertible bond is maturing on February 15, 2019. We are expecting to repay bondholders at par value using a portion of our $2.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. Moving now to guidance. Today, we are providing guidance for both Q1 and full year 2019 along with some early thoughts on 2020. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we are projecting another solid quarter on both the top and bottom-line. We do expect to see some normal sequential revenue decline that we typically see in Q1 due to seasonality. And perhaps a bit more pronounced this year due to the very strong holiday season this past quarter. In addition, we expect some foreign exchange impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar. The current spot rates foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact of approximately $14 million compared to Q1 of 2018. Therefore, we're expecting Q1 revenues in the range of $690 million to $704 million or up 5% to 7% in constant currency over Q1 of 2018. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 78%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $252 million to $256 million down from fourth quarter spend levels even as we absorb the incremental expenses associated with the Janrain acquisition. The decline in Q1 is partially due to incentive compensation plans resetting at the beginning of the year partially driven by the recent workforce reduction actions, Jim mentioned a few moments ago. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins in the range of 41% to 42% consistent with Q4 levels. Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $90 million to $92 million which includes the impact of the network server useful life change I mentioned earlier. Factoring in this guidance we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 28% to 29% for Q1. Moving on to CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $126 million to $136 million excluding equity compensation in the first quarter. With the overall revenue and spend configuration I outlined. We expect Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.05 or up 31% to 37% to constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $35 million to $37 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18%. And it also reflects a fully diluted share count of 164 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we are anticipating revenue in the range of $2.81 million to $2.85 million which factors in a negative impact of roughly $16 million due to foreign exchange. We also expect a revenue by quarter to follow the same quarter-over-quarter trends that we saw in 2018. For the full year, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 41% and we expect 2019 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 28% up approximately 1.5 points over full year 2018 levels. And we are on a trajectory to further expand non-GAAP operating margins to 30% in 2020. It is worth noting that we do see some expense headwinds in 2019. We expect approximately $8 million per quarter of additional operating expenses beginning in Q3 as the benefit of our patent royalty payments from Limelight comes to an end. And as we take on higher rent costs related to our new Cambridge headquarters, therefore, we expect to see a slight decline in both EBITDA and operating margins in Q3 with an improvement in Q4. Moving on a CapEx, full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 19% of revenue. Included in our 2019 CapEx spend is roughly a $100 million of onetime costs related to the buildout of our new headquarters that is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Excluding our headcount related spend, our CapEx levels are in line with our long-term model. At these revenue and margin levels along with an expected non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18% and fully diluted share count of approximately $164 million, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.15 for the full year 2019. At the midpoint of that range non-GAAP EPS would be up 14% year-over-year when adjusted for foreign exchange. We are pleased with how full year 2019 is shaping up particularly from a margin expansion and profit perspective. In 2019, we plan to continue investing and innovating in areas we believe will drive future growth, continue to refine and optimize our go-to-market efforts and ensure we are well-positioned to capture a growing share of the OTT market as we continue to focus on quality, cost and scale. We are optimistic that our efforts in 2019 across the company will result in an acceleration in growth rate for both revenue and EPS in 2020. Given our expectations of significant traffic growth in 2020 due to more events such as the Olympics and the U.S. Presidential election as well as more direct to consumer offerings coming to market later in 2019 and early 2020, strong adoption of our new Customer Identity and Access Management products, increased market traction of our enterprise security products and continued strong growth in our core Web security products such as Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager. In closing, we are very bullish about the opportunities ahead for Akamai. We are confident in our ability to deliver revenue growth along with margin and earning expansion, achieve our 30% operating margin goal in 2020 and continue to invest in innovation to drive future growth. Thank you. Tom, Jim and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from James Breen with William Blair. Your line is now open. James Breen : Thanks for taking the question. Just can you talk about the security business and how you've seen the sales go between sort of the core DDoS, and then, some of the other products that you've sold. From a customer perspective what types of products taking all services from you guys? Thanks. Tom Leighton : Yes. We're seeing strong adoption across the board starting with DDoS, then we have Kona Site Defender, which protects applications from being corrupted or taken over or the Web site content from being corrupted, theft during transactions. Bot Manager as we've talked about before is our fastest new selling product and memory. The majority of transactions today are no longer human. There's bots and particularly the bots are trying to take over user accounts. The vast majority of log-ins today are not legitimate people but bots who are trying out stolen credentials. So very strong adoption across the board, and we're starting to get traction now with our Zero Trust Enterprise Security Solution. As I mentioned we signed up our first $1 million a year customer. And what was really nice about that is it came from an account that would never have likely bought our normal content delivery, Web acceleration products. So, the security business just across the board is doing very well. James Breen : From a growth perspective, is growth coming from -- or can you give a little color on where it's coming from new customers versus existing customers taking more volumes? Tom Leighton : It's both. The large fraction of our new customer bookings are for security today and we are getting good up sell with the new products within the existing base. For example, Bot Manager being a new product with our enterprise security offerings, early days, but there's both new customers like the one that became our $1 million customer, they weren't a customer before, but also selling that within existing accounts. So, I would say both are strong new customers and upselling the new security offerings within existing accounts. James Breen : Great thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Congrats on a great Q4. And Jim it's been great working with you and we look forward to working with Ed, so congrats on a great run there. Jim Benson : Thank you. Brad Zelnick : You're welcome. Just a follow on the cloud security question, cloud security remains really impressive. How should we think about the sustainability and the visibility that you have here to the growth? And can you comment on pricing trends for WAF and DDoS in the market? Tom Leighton : Yes. We anticipate continuing a very strong growth rate probably not in the 30s over the next couple of years, but I would say certainly in the mid-20%. We did benefit last year from the acquisition of Nominum and their security products, which are doing quite well, but with the acquisition we got a boost in 2018. In terms of pricing; the pricing is very strong. We have unique capabilities and they are very much needed by major enterprises. So, we're in a very strong position there to be able to maintain growth. Brad Zelnick : Thank you. And Jim, just to follow-up or add perhaps, in Tom's remarks, he had mentioned that you'd spent less on network costs in 2018 than in the prior year and Jim in your prepared remarks as well. You talked about efficiencies with bandwidth and qualification costs. Can you just remind us once again the sources of efficiencies along the entire stack? And how you're able to do that and what the limits of these are as we look out into achieving 30% and perhaps even beyond in the years to come? Jim Benson : That's a great question. I mean this is not new for Akamai as you know. We've made tremendous progress on network efficiencies for a long, long time. And some of the things we've talked about in the past have been, we continue to implement new software to get more throughput out of our servers. And so, you certainly saw that I think because of our breadth and the amount of traffic that we serve from a bandwidth perspective, we get very favorable bandwidth pricing and in some cases, we actually get free bandwidth for our customers. The same is true for co-location that we've been able to reduce our co-location spend by reducing the footprint and getting more throughput out of the servers as I mentioned. So, I would say it's not new. It's something we've been doing for quite some time. We continue to work on engineering innovation to continue to drive that. We continue to work on things around negotiations with providers and I expect those things will continue Brad. I do think that as I outlined at our Investor Day in June that I expected that network costs and our gross margins on a cash basis would be in the high 70s. And we're ahead of where I expected to be. So, I think we should be able to stabilize those margins from where they are. And as I outlined before that on the path of 30, we're pretty close. We'll call it -- we're at roughly 28% now. And we think we're going to be able drive more efficiency out of G&A in particular. We're building out a new procurement set of capabilities and we're going to be able to drive more procurement savings we've done some facility consolidation. We'll continue to do that and we're driving some IT enablement that will allow us to take more G&A costs out. So primarily kind of going forward mostly from G&A. I'd say we're also getting some efficiencies on the go-to-market side as we build out a more efficient go-to-market model in both our Web and our media division. And so, I mean that's not going to be the bulk of where the incremental margin is going to come from it's going to largely come from G&A, but you'll also see continued improvements within sales and marketing spend. Brad Zelnick : That's really helpful. But just to be clear, the tick up in CapEx in 2019, that's really just due to the $100 million one-time expenditure towards the new headquarters, correct? Jim Benson : Yes. Yes. And I outlined at the Analyst Day that we'd have a big uptick kind of one-time for the new Cambridge headquarters. If you -- I think Ed outlined in his prepared remarks that if you actually adjust for that, we're actually well in line with our model that we've outlined a kind of 15% to 16% of revenue. So, the uptick in CapEx is all Cambridge headquarter related. Brad Zelnick : Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Tim Horan : Thanks guys. Tom can you give us an update on your major hyperscale customers essentially. Where are they with do-it-yourself, do you think you're pulling ahead in terms of technology and cost capabilities versus them? And maybe the same color with some of the sort of competitors that are out there. Thank you. Tom Leighton : Yes. Some of the largest Internet platform companies have do-it-yourself efforts. They are used for large software downloads, some basic delivery. Our services we believe are a lot more effective at doing this offer, a lot more scalability and higher quality and that's the reason there's so few of the companies that really could think about affording to do what themselves because that's a big cost for them. I don't see any fundamental change in that landscape. In general, the competitive landscape as a whole hasn't really changed all that much. There's a lot of competitors, the folks that have been doing CDM for a long, long time, plenty of startups out there trying to get in the business. And of course, the do-it-yourself. No fundamental change. We, I think continue to gain share and we do that through superior performance, competitive pricing, the largest scale that's available on the Internet and increasingly our security solutions are very helpful for us in terms of gaining share especially with the performance solutions. We sell packages protect and perform, in the same platform that accelerates the side or delivers the content secures it and security is really important for our customers and nobody really is in a position to offer the kinds of capabilities that we do there. Tim Horan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. A few questions on growth. I was hoping you can give us what the organic growth was in 2018, so backing out the benefit from some of the acquisitions that occurred in parts of 2017. And then, also what the implied organic revenue growth is for 2019 and maybe as part of that just what your assumptions are for Janrain. And then, my other question just has to do with the performance segment, I know you don't break that out anymore, but when you give your guidance for 2019, what is your just broad expectations or assumptions for that that went into that. Thank you. Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. This is Ed. In terms of our organic growth last year, it's [4.7%] [ph]. If you look at Nominum headed about $40 million roughly last year to the growth rate. As far as our expectations around Janrain expecting it to be approximately $20 million not significant for 2019 in terms of revenue. But we do expect to get significant traction in the marketplace with our customers and expect to see significant growth going into 2020 in new Janrain products. And as far as the organic growth, now, we're expecting [cyber] [ph] security solutions to be growing in the mid 20s as Tom talked about it and if you do the math on that basically it would suggest that the CDM and other business is roughly flat and a lot of that is driven by trends that we're seeing in media. We had a very tough compare this year in terms of media, in terms of the gaming sector. We have a number of large renewals in the first half of the year. We've got some industry consolidation that's really adding to the impact of some of those renewals and a lot of these deals were put in place about 18 to 24 months. So, I'd say that's really normal things that you see in the media and entertainment place. As far as the Web Division, we are continuing to see a little bit of pressure here in the commerce space as we talked about in the past and that's really what's adding to the flattening of our CDN and other business. We do expect to see that return to growth in 2020 as we expect to see a significant uptick in our media business going to 2020. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Charlie Erlikh with Baird. Your line is now open. Charlie Erlikh : Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about the enterprise security products specifically. In the past, compared those enterprise -- I guess the enterprise business to what the security business was in its early days. And I just wanted to ask I guess, how the enterprise business has been doing so far relative to those expectations. So, I guess the question is, how is the adoption the bookings and the overall interest been relative to your initial expectations for that enterprise business. Tom Leighton : Doing very well. Obviously, early days, but we had very strong bookings this year up substantially over 2017. And so, and we're anticipating even stronger bookings next year. So, I would say we're very pleased with the progress in enterprise security. I think in the long run, it should be a bigger business than the Web security business. You think about enterprises more of them, almost all of them in fact care about enterprise security. And only really certain verticals are focused on Web security, which is our current product set. And the amount of money that enterprises spend today on firewalls and trying to prevent data breaches is much greater than what companies will spend on securing a Web site. So, I think the market's bigger and I think we're really at the cusp of a major change in how enterprises secure themselves. The notion of Zero Trust what everybody is talking about that now. Take years for enterprises really to fully make the transition, but the first customers now are embracing that and adopting Zero Trust Solutions. So, I think a very exciting future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. First, Jim congratulations on completing a great tenure as CFO and Ed congratulations on your promotion. Jim Benson : Thank you, Sterling. Sterling Auty : And then, in terms of, you talked about the different detail around the growth dynamics into 2019. I think that's very helpful. But you did mention in the prepared remarks especially the OTT strength and with preparation some of the launches that have gone on. What are you seeing in terms of the uptick there and is the pricing in those opportunities different than what you've seen in traditional media delivery? Tom Leighton : Yes. So, a couple of things there. And I'll start with the back, the last part of the question around pricing. Really pricing in the media space is really driven by volume. So, there's really no difference in terms of high volume with OTT customer or high-volume software download customer. We do tend to get additional value on our OTT space from security sales and professional services et cetera. But in terms of the traffic expectations as we look at the guidance, we take a look at the customers that we have today, we've got pretty good trends and track record in terms of understanding how their businesses grow. As we look out, I talked a little bit about some of the launches that may be coming at the back half of '19 and '20. We tend to take a bit of a conservative approach there for a variety of reasons. Many of the things that go into an OTT launch that went past us really revolve around traffic growth and there's a lot to think about in terms of the exact date of the launch, sometimes launches can be moved. It is very complex technology and workflows that are involved. Sometimes customers want to launch them either in a limited fashion. It's really not until it gets to be a service that is a market that we really get a good handle in terms of what we expect in terms of volumes. Also, other things that impacted is the service of paid subscription services is ad supported, what is the user adoption, what's our share of traffic, what's the engagement time of the user, what's the bit rate? So, as we look at 2019 any of these OTT offerings that are coming in the back half of the year were very, very conservative in terms of the adoption rate, the impact on outcome. Sterling Auty : Okay. All right. That makes sense to me. And then, one follow-up would be, you gave the 28% operating income margin guide for 2019. I want to make sure I'm thinking about this the right way. What would that guidance have been under the old depreciation rules in terms of the four years instead of five years? Ed McGowan : Yes. I said it's about $24 million FX, so it's a little less than a point. Yes, keep in mind also that I mentioned that we're taking on Janrain as well, so included in the guidance was the impact of Janrain. So, you'd have to add that back-in. So, if you add those two things roughly [net each other out] [ph]. Sterling Auty : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Weiss : Thank you, guys for taking the question and a nice quarter. Two questions from me, one, just more broadly and I guess this is a question for Ed. Kind of walk us through again sign of where you guys get the confidence to sort of this for accelerating growth into 2020? And I mean forecasting is top [or saying] [ph] two years is really tough. But what are the kind of like mechanical things that you can see better growth in 2020? And then, one, this is probably for Tom. How do you enter in 2019? How do you feel about sort of your sales forces ability to sell outside of your traditional customer? I mean like the selling point within a customer of going from the guy who's traditionally in charge of the Web site to now selling directly to a [indiscernible] or just selling to other guys within the organization who hasn't traditionally been be the sweet spot for Akamai. Ed McGowan : Sure. I'll take the 2020, the confidence there. So, one thing to think about -- I will talk about media first and I'll get into the Web in a second. If you think about media, there is a odd year, even year phenomenon and I talked about in the prepared remarks that 2020 will have additional events for us that we won't see in '19. And one of the reasons why our growth rate is a little bit lower in the media business this year is the fact that we did have some large events in 2018. That's one thing. The other thing I mentioned was the -- some of the big renewals that are coming up and I touched a bit on the consolidation in the industry there's been some very, very big consolidation. And there you're taking, that will be a bit more of a decline in terms of your prices due to the fact that you've got no additional volume that's added when you put the two companies together. And also, there are a number of services for example, the companies might have professional services engagements and whittle that down to one et cetera. But these things are very temporary. And what we see is you see a decline in the business. And then as traffic ramps you see revenue grow again so that that's one thing. The other thing is that we've seen some significant security growth in both of our verticals. But sticking with media, we made a change back in the beginning of the year and our compensation plans and we saw a significant increase in our revenue from security and there's still a tremendous amount of wide space there to go. And then, in terms of the OTT offerings I talked about, if you look at some of the offerings that are coming to market. Well, I talked about -- bit about being a little bit more cautious in '19 and '2020 we feel that those offerings will start to take hold in the market and we believe we're positioned very well to do so. And part of that is addressing some of these concerns around consolidation and being -- playing the long game in terms of being a partner and helping with some of the synergies on the cost side. On the Web side, there's a number of go-to-market initiatives that we put in place. We're starting to see some pretty good traction in terms of our new customer efforts that we've put in place in 2018. We're seeing significant growth in outside the U.S. both in APJ and EMEA. We're also seeing some pretty good growth in APJ and Media as well. And then, just security in general within the Web Division, so a lot of wide space to go and then we're very optimistic about the Customer Identity Access Management demand that we expect to see there as well as an uptick in our enterprise security products. So, all of that together gives us the confidence to feel that we'll see an acceleration in 2020. Keith Weiss : That's super helpful. Tom Leighton : And on your question about selling the security solutions, we've made a lot of progress there. Pretty much all of the sales force is expected to be able to sell security solutions and they're doing that with the Kona sales, the CSO, with a security organization pretty much always involved there even though that's sold to for the Web site. With the Bot Manager product and being all about fraud prevention there that's the security organization typically heavily engaged with that. Prolexic that's a data center protection level sale really nothing to do with the Web site per se. It protects all the assets in the data center. So, there we're dealing with the data center networking security side of the house. We're putting a lot of effort in our marketing to get better known as a security company. Past year we hired a new Global Head of Web Sales, Scott Lovett who's well-known as a security expert. In fact, the large majority of our new customer bookings are led by security now. So, I would say we're doing very well and making the transition in terms of a sales force that sells CDN to a sales force that sells security. Now the Zero Trust Solutions is the next step in that direction. And we're off to a good start there. Keith Weiss : Thanks. That sounds great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Brandon Nispel : Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. I'm going to ask a growth question again. So, you mentioned the CDN business will be flat in 2019, but return to growth in 2020 due to the big events. What do you think is sort of two-year stacked growth rate and what's sustainable in that business over a multi-year timespan? That's one. And two, just to be clear, I guess more of a housekeeping, does your guidance embed pricing declines from some of the consolidation that's going on? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Sure. I'll take the last question. This is Ed. I'll take the last question first. Yes, we did embed the expected pricing declines in our guidance. In terms of the core CDN business, if you look at our core CDN business excluding net giants just as the giants can sometimes skew some of the results. They grew at about 4% in '17 and above 4% and '18. We're calling for roughly a flat year here as we go through some of the items that I talked about and then a return to growth. So, I think looking at that trend low single digits is probably the right way to think about that business. I think one of things that Jim pointed out some of their cost initiatives that are going on in that business, it is a very profitable business for us and it's something that we're going to continue to optimize as we go forward. And really in terms of the next big leg up in growth OTT once that becomes a significant portion of users viewing time that's the decision to begin to accelerate. Brandon Nispel : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits : Hey, guys. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Jim of course congratulations to you and a privilege working with you, and Ed, welcome to the slot and congratulations as well. Jim Benson : Thank you. Michael Turits : Two questions, one on CDN, one on security. First, one on CDN, in terms that that flattish growth for 2019. Is that any different in terms of the growth expectation for the media delivery piece as opposed to the Web performance piece within the CDN segment? Tom Leighton : Yes. So, it's roughly the same, Michael. Give or take a percentage point or two. Michael Turits : Right. So, it sounds like that's maybe a slightly an improvement maybe in performance stabilizing a bit? Tom Leighton : I would say it's more stabilizing a bit. Michael Turits : All right. And then, my next question is on Security. So, security isn't great. As you pointed out it's about $750 million run rate and you're looking to get it to $1 billion by 2020. But I think it's probably been mostly WAF and DDoS up to this point. But, the combined market for those two is only about $2 billion. So, it seems as if we're going to get to $1 billion yourself. Unlikely you'd be 50% of that market, so you must be anticipating a really good contribution outside of WAF and DDoS. Can you give us some sense for how big you think the non WAF and DDoS piece of your security business could be by 2020? Tom Leighton : I think the vast majority of it will be WAF and DDoS in 2020. We do command a very strong share because we have really unique capabilities there in the market. Now that said, over the longer term we're looking for the non-WAF items particularly enterprise security, Zero Trust to drive a lot of growth. We also get smaller contributions would be from Nominum with their enterprise security solutions that we sell actually to carriers and they provide it as a channel. And there's smaller pieces here and there with the fast DNS, but the vast majority is WAF and DDoS. And I think it'll take a little bit of time for the other pieces really, which will be led by enterprise security and the Zero Trust solutions to be a big share of that. I would count Bot Manager as part of WAF, when I say Bot Manager that's part of WAF because that's a very fast growing product and that's a pretty good share of what we'll see in 2020. Michael Turits : Great Tom. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Robert Gutman : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering in the non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the year, is there anything else that's one time holding that back besides the depreciation in Janrain anything related to headquarters or is that all in CapEx? Jim Benson : Yes. So, as I mentioned in Q3, we'll start to see the rent expense hits in Q3 associated with the new headquarters building. Other than that there's really no onetime items in it. Obviously, as I mentioned the Limelight patent royalty going away in Q3, but other than that there's really no other onetime items. But Janrain is also something that you need to -- keep into consideration as well in margin guidance. Robert Gutman : Got it. Thank you Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : I want to follow up on some of the -- two of the OTT questions. Could you at least ring fence the opportunity in OTT for Akamai in kind of leaving aside the timing? How much of an incremental opportunity you see this some of the launches are relatively well publicized as to who hopes to launch an OTT service, but just maybe not talking specifically about customers, but whether any of those potential launches that are clear opportunities for you or some that just aren't because you don't -- you have never with that company. Just ring fence the opportunity both on the low side and high side in 2020 and 2021? Thank you. Tom Leighton : Yes. Without talking about timing, we work with all the companies that have been rumored to have OTT offers. When Ed talked about before, it's really hard to predict timing and scale success, adoption and those kinds of things. So, we tend to take a pretty conservative view there in terms of our guidance. I think if you look longer term in what could be on a global basis for OTT, there's tremendous opportunity for growth. If you get to the point where the majority of TV or video watching is done online, which a lot of people think will happen and it's done at high quality say at least 10 megabits per second. There's the opportunity for orders of magnitude of increased traffic. Now timing on that is really hard to predict. As you know there's a couple of companies that either do it all themselves and so we don't participate in their revenue, but for the large majority of the OTT providers those that are setting up new services both here and globally. We have very good relationships and are in a position to benefit. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you. Tom Barth : Operator, we have time for probably one more question. Operator : Yes, sir. Our last question will come Sameet Sinha with B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open. Sameet Sinha : Yes. Thank you very much. And Jim and Ed congratulations on your next steps. A couple of questions here. Saw some nice leverage on the R&D line in the fourth quarter. Can you speak to that specifically what exactly is going on? Obviously that division has probably been impacted somewhat by the consultant recommendations and other sort of efficiency initiatives that you have. Secondly, if you can just talk about the churn rate, this is the second quarter in a row where you mentioned that churn rate has gone down. Can you specifically address what are some of the key initiatives that you've taken to make sure that this means a continued dynamic? Thank you. Jim Benson : On the R&D leverage. I mean as I outlined earlier the bigger source of leverage for the company for margin expansion is really going to come from G&A, sales and marketing to some extent and also some network costs. We did see a little bit of leverage in R&D. As you know, we capitalize a fair amount of our R&D spend for new innovation and you should you view that as good because that effectively means that new product innovation that's being incubated. We saw a bit of an uptick on that from Q3 to Q4 in our kind of capitalization activity, which has a benefit in your operating expenses. But I think by and large, we expect our R&D spend as a percent of revenue to be roughly flat over the next couple of years because we don't want to under invest in a critical area to drive growth for the company. Tom Leighton : Yes. In terms of the churn rate that's all about making the customer happy providing great performance. We have great professional services. Our people are really great and the customers like that. Innovative new products. Our customers want to see a roadmap and investment and innovation to help them stay ahead of the game. A low rate of service incidents things that go wrong and we listen to our customers and engage with them. And provide them the level of service that they're looking for. So, in general our customers are very, very happy with Akamai and that's directly reflected in a very low churn rate. And we are very pleased to see it decrease further in Q4 and 2018. Sameet Sinha : Okay. Thank you very much. Tom Barth : Well, thank you. In closing, we'll be presenting at several investor conferences throughout the remainder of the quarter. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And we thank you for joining us and wish you a very nice evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tom Barth : Thank you, Candice. And good afternoon and thank you all for joining Akamai's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, these statements including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the Company's view on April 30, 2019. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Thomson Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the first quarter with revenue, margins and earnings all coming in above expectation. Revenue was $707 million, up 6% over Q1 of 2018 and up 8% in constant currency. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $1.10 per diluted share up 39% year-over-year and up 42% in constant currency. The revenue over achievement was driven by the continued rapid growth of our Cloud Security business and very strong traffic growth from our media customers. Our earnings also benefited from a lower tax rate and our continued focus on operational excellence. Our EBITDA margin in Q1 was 42% up four points over Q1 of last year and our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 30% up two points from the prior quarter and up five points over Q1 of 2018. We were very pleased to see our margins improved for the sixth consecutive quarter. As you can clearly see from our strong financial results, we've made excellent progress towards our goal of achieving non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while also continuing to invest in innovation, new products and acquisitions to drive our future growth. Our security portfolio continued to be the fastest growing part of our business and Q1 achieving revenue of $190 million up 29% year-over-year in constant currency and Bot Manager continued to be our fastest selling new product in recent memory with nearly 400 customers now under contract. Bot Manager uses sophisticated AI and machine learning to distinguish between human neuromuscular signatures and machine generated requests. This technology is especially effective in floating bots that are trying to take over end user accounts and commit fraud across a range of consumer facing applications such as apparel sales, event ticket sales, travel reservations and gaming and streaming services. Our success in the cybersecurity space was widely recognized in Q1 when we were named as the winner of nine industry award. For example, our flagship Kona Site Defender Service won the award for Best Web Application Solution at the recent RSA Conference. And a well-known security buyer's guide announced that they will honor our new enterprise application access service as the best enterprise secure access solution and the best security solution for retail at their upcoming awards event in June. While it's gratifying to receive such accolades, we do not intend to slow down or rest on our laurels. In January, we closed our acquisition of Janrain, a market leader in the customer and identity access management space. Using their technology we've created the Akamai identity cloud, a new service which is designed to help customers stop credential abuse and account fraud, manage and protect consumer data and comply with regional data regulations. Last quarter, we also announced our new joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan. The joint venture is called GO-NET, which stands for Global Open Network. GO-NET will offer a new blockchain-based online payment platform that's designed to enable next generation digital financial transactions to be scalable, fast, efficient and secure. We expect the GO-NET services will become available in Japan next year. And earlier this month, we announced our expanded partnership with Microsoft Azure. By combining the power of Azure with the vast reach of the Akamai Edge, we plan to help content providers maximize performance and scale, mitigate costs, and realize the benefits of the cloud to deliver the best possible online experiences. We believe that this partnership demonstrates the essential role that our Edge platform plays in the evolving hybrid cloud ecosystem. We were also very pleased with a strong performance of our media business in Q1. Traffic growth expected for both OTT traffic and software downloads with several records set for volume, and we continued to grow traffic faster than the Internet as a whole in Q1, which means that we continued to gain share. We believe that our Edge platform's ability to deliver superior performance at scale and when accounts most is a key reason why so many of the world's major media companies rely on Akamai for their content delivery. In summary, we're very pleased with our results in Q1 and the strong momentum that we've established heading into 2019. It's very good to see our strong revenue growth and security, the strong traffic growth in our CDN business. That continued improvement in our operating margins and over 40% growth in non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter in a row. We also continued to bring innovative new technology to market and to receive awards and recognition for our product leadership. And we managed to do all this while keeping Akamai a great place to work. In fact, just this month Akamai was named one of 50 great places to work in Washington DC, one of the three best places to work in Poland where we have over 600 employees, and one of America's best midsize employers. Our highly talented and motivated workforce is a key differentiator for Akamai and one reason why we're off to such a great start in 2019. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed to review our Q1 results and provide guidance for the year ahead. Ed? Edward McGowan : Thank you, Tom. I'm very pleased to be here for my first call with Akamai as CFO, especially with such great results to talk about. Before I begin, I want to thank Jim Benson for all his efforts, ensuring a seamless transition. As Tom outlined, Akamai continued to perform well and had a very strong first quarter. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance range on revenue, operating margin, and earnings. Q1 mark the sixth consecutive quarter of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal of 30% non-GAAP operating margins in 2020. Q1 revenue came in above the high-end of our range at $707 million, up 6% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency. Revenue growth continued to be solid across the business, driven by rapid growth of security services and higher than expected media traffic notably within the Internet platform customers. Revenue from our Web Division was $376 million, up 7% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. Web Division growth was led again by another very strong quarter of security growth as we continue to see strong adoption of our entire security portfolio. First quarter security revenue was $190 million, up 27% year-over-year or 29% in constant currency. We are very pleased to see continued strong revenue growth from both our Web and Media Division customers. Revenue from our recently closed Janrain acquisition contributed almost $4 million in the quarter and is included in our total security revenue. As Tom mentioned, we believe security remains a tremendous growth opportunity and we plan to continue to invest to further enhance and extend our product portfolio as well as expand our go-to-market capabilities. Revenue from our Media and Carrier Division customers was $330 million, up 5% year-over-year, were 7% in constant currency, led by higher than expected traffic growth in gaming, video and software downloads. Revenue from the Internet Platform customers was $47 million, up 6% from the prior year and up 9% from the prior quarter. Q1 marks the first time since its Q3 of 2015 that we have seen growth year-over-year from this group of customers. Moving on to geographies, sales in our international markets continue to be strong and represented 41% of total revenue in Q1, up two points from the prior quarter and Q1 represented the first time our international revenue was greater than 40% of total. International revenue was $288 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year, were 24% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in Asia and another solid quarter in EMEA. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $1 million on a sequential basis, but a $15 million negative impact year-over-year. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $418 million, down 1% year over year. Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 78%, down one point from Q4 levels, one point higher than the same period last year and in line with our guidance. Our margins continue to benefit from our ongoing network efficiency efforts. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 66% consistent with Q4 levels. As a reminder, we needed to change our estimated useful life of servers from four years to five years this quarter. That change resulted in a benefit of approximately $8 million and had a one point impact on our GAAP gross margin, in line with our expectations and our guidance. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $253 million, down $9 million from Q4 levels and in line with our guidance. Moving now to profitability. The adjusted EBITDA was $299 million, down $2 million from Q4 levels, but up $43 million or 17% from the same period in 2018. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 42%, consistent with Q4, but up four points from Q1 2018 and at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was $210 million, up $9 million from Q4 levels and up to $43 million were 26% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 30% of two points from Q4 levels, up five points from Q1 of last year and above our guidance range. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $130 million and in line with our guidance. Moving on to earnings. Non-GAAP net income was $181 million or $1.10 of earnings per diluted share, up 39% year-over-year and up 42% in constant currency and $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range. These strong earnings results were driven by higher than expected revenue growth, ongoing network and operating expense efficiencies in the slightly lower tax rate. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $37 million based on a Q1 effective tax rate of 17%. This effective tax rate is one point lower than our guidance driven by a higher percentage of foreign earnings. Moving onto GAAP earnings. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $107 million or $0.65 of earnings per diluted share. Now moving to some balance sheet items. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet. As of March 31, our cash, cash equivalents in marketable securities totaled $1.2 billion. During the quarter, we paid off our $690 million convertible debt obligation that was due in February. This payment reduced our total debt to $1.2 billion of senior convertible notes which will be due in May of 2025. During Q1 we also had two other large cash outlays worth noting. The first was the acquisition of Janrain which closed in January and the second was the funding of our joint venture with Mitsubishi Financial Group of Japan. Another balance sheet item I'd like to call out, is that we adopted the new lease accounting guidance or ASC 842 in the first quarter. This resulted in us putting operating lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to our leases for office space and our co-location facilities. ASC 842 did not have an impact on our income statement or cash flows. Now I'll review our use of capital. We continue to focus on the importance of returning capital to shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we spent $35 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 500,000 shares. We expect the amount of quarterly share repurchases to increase during the year as we aim to fully offset or dilution during 2019. We have $1.1 billion remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Going forward, we intend to continue to return a large percentage of free cash flow through share repurchases, balanced against preserving our flexibility for strategic opportunities. We believe our disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach will allow us to continue to drive shareholder value through investing organically in the business, pursuing M&A and continued share repurchases. We are very pleased with how the business performed in Q1 and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long-term. Now I'd like to provide Q2 guidance and an update on our previous 2019 guidance. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we are projecting another solid quarter on both the top and bottom lines. This is despite foreign exchange headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact of approximately $12 million compared to Q2 of 2018 and a $2 million sequential revenue headwind in Q2. Therefore, we are estimating Q2 revenue to be in the range of $688 million to $702 million were up 6% to 8% in constant currency over Q2 2018. At these revenue levels we expect cash gross margin of approximately 78%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $255 million to $260 million, up from first quarter spend levels driven partly by a full quarter of Janrain expenses and our Edge customer event in June. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense detail I just provided, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins in the range of 40% to 41%. Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation of $87 million to $89 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 28% for Q2. Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $157 million to $167 million excluding equity compensation in the second quarter. This includes approximately $34 million related to the continued build-out of our new headquarters as well as a more significant network investment in anticipation of increased OTT traffic in 2020. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.97 to $1.02 were up 22% to 28% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of approximately $34 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17% and it also reflects a fully diluted share count of 165 million shares. Looking ahead to the full-year we are increasing our revenue and EPS guidance. On the revenue side despite of projected year-on-year headwind of $32 million from foreign exchange which is up $16 million since our last guidance. We are increasing our guidance to revenue in the range of $2.82 billion to $2.86 billion. For the full-year, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 41% and we expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 28%. As we mentioned last quarter, we do expect to see some expense headwinds during the remainder of 2019. In particular, we are anticipating approximately $8 million per quarter of additional operating expense beginning in Q3 as the benefit of our patent royalty payments from Limelight comes to an end and as we take on higher costs related to our new Cambridge headquarters. Therefore, we expect to see a slight decline in both EBITDA and operating margins in Q3 from Q2 levels with an improvement in Q4. Moving on to CapEx. Full-year CapEx is expected to be approximately 19% to 20% of revenue. Included in our 2019 CapEx spend is roughly $100 million of one-time costs related to the build-out of our new headquarters. Excluding this spend, we predict our CapEx to be at the high-end of our long-term model due to increased network build outs in anticipation of more significant OTT traffic in 2020. Moving to EPS. We are increasing our non-GAAP EPS or non-GAAP earnings per diluted share by $0.05 to $4.05 and $4.20 for the full-year 2019. This higher range is despite a projected incremental six set foreign exchange headwind compared to our previous guidance. Our EPS range assumes an expected non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 17% in a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and our improved outlook for the year. Thank you. And Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter. If I could maybe sneak in a two parter. One on the strength that you guys saw with Internet platform customers or the big platform customers coming back, so how do you guys think about the durability of that strength, is that - are these levels or sort of - is growth something that we could expect on a going forward basis? And this is part one. And on the other side of the equation, on the security side of the business still really good growth there. Did it kind of exceed expectations in the same way that you have in prior quarters? How are you feeling about sort of the durability of growth there? And then like a nuance question given that those are mostly subscription businesses, I would have expected a little bit more of a sequential increase quarter-on-quarter in the security business particularly since January and has entered into that. Anything that we should just thinking about in terms of one-time items in the last quarter that might have sort of changed that seasonality that Q-on-Q increase that we've seen in a lot of prior quarters. Edward McGowan : Sure. Keith, this is Ed. I'll take the first question on the strengthening the Internet platform customers. So the strength really came from video gaming and software. And I think the important thing here is to note that what it really demonstrates is that, despite the fact that these are large do-it-yourself customers. Akamai still has an important role and generally these customers will turn to us for scale or reach and geographies where there are not built out for security, for Web delivery, for functionality or for lowering live video. So we believe we still have a big opportunity with the Internet platform customers. But in terms of your second question as far as, should we think about this growth as being sustainable? I'd say kind of looking into the next quarter, I project it to be sort of flat to probably down $1 million to $2 million and sort of that range for the rest of the year. You got to keep in mind that they are no primarily large media customers and just like any media customers will have to go through some ups and downs in terms of contract renegotiations and also some of the content that we deliver, whether it's gaming content or software downloads can also be a little bit seasonal in the sense that you may have some quarters we have unusually large downloads or in the case of Q1, we saw significant number of really popular gaming releases. Thomson Leighton : And on the security side, we're really excited about the potential for our security business. You know, growing at 29% was a little bit higher than we forecasted in guidance for Q1. Now I remember that the Nominum acquisition has now experienced its full year-over-year wrap around and there'll be a little bit smaller now than they were before, but 29% is great. In terms of Janrain, as Ed mentioned, it was a small amount in Q1 about $4 million. Now the nice thing about Janrain is that has a long runway. I've talked to a lot of customers, since the acquisition. They're very excited about the technology to manage customer logins to do that in a safe way. So they don't lose customer data. There's a lot of regional laws being passed around the world and they've got to comply with those laws and we can help them do that with Janrain. We can help support user opt-in, in terms of how the data's used. So a lot of runway to go with Janrain, very exciting. And of course you can have our enterprise security solutions, which I briefly mentioned in terms of winning awards in Q1 and they again are very small revenue today, but a tremendous runway with our zero trust architecture, a lot of excitement around that for the future. So we're optimistic. We can keep growing our security business that are very rapid clip well into the foreseeable future. Edward McGowan : Yes. Keith, just on your question around one-time item, just one thing to point out in Q4, we had a stronger than expected quarter with Nominum and Q1 one was a little bit lower. That tends to be timing. That's fairly common with the careers we tend to see a bit stronger Q4 and a little bit weaker in Q1. Just thought, I'd point that out. Keith Weiss : Got it. That's super helpful guys. Thank you so much for answers there. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Wanted to dive into the increase investment in the network ahead of the OTT demand, if I rewind a little while back, we were in a similar situation, granted I think with more uncertainty on what apple might do and be able to do in terms of their service, et cetera. But what I'm curious about is where's the confidence level this time around in the visibility that that traffic will actually materialize in 2020. And how might the monetization of that traffic differ versus traditional media traffic if at all? Thomson Leighton : Sure. I'll take that one. It's Tom. So yes, we're increasing our investment. In this time, I think what I would say is different is last time was really focused around one of that here and we've talked about a number of customers that are coming out with launching. Disney is one example, where there's a number of different opportunities that were more confident that we'll be able to see additional traffic growth associated with those. And in terms of the profitability relative to traditional media, I would say in line with - I wouldn't expect anything different there. Other than the fact if you see no significantly higher volumes, a lot of media pricing is based on volume discounting. So maybe a little bit of that there. But that's the, that's the primary reason why we're more confident. And the other thing to note too is our normal growth for traffic has been very, very strong. Tom alluded to the fact its growing faster than internet race. So the extent that we lean in a little bit here in Q2 just to be ready in case we do see significant traffic growth out of the gates. If we don't see that we can just dial back our CapEx spend and grow into the additional dollars spending. Edward McGowan : Yes. We're always going to use this equipment. So the worst that happens, we don't see a lot of the upside on revenue, but we'll be using that equipment a quarter or two later. Sterling Auty : Sounds fair. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Great, thanks a lot, and a good performance this quarter. My first question is for Tom. Tom in your prepared remarks, you talked about expanding the Microsoft Azure partnership, which I think appeared in the press release earlier this month, and I think some people might have missed it. So can you talk about the nature of the relationship? Is there incentive for either side to sell each other's products and capabilities and what would have to happen for this relationship to generate upside to forecast this year? Thomson Leighton : Yes. I think it's a very good relationship for Akamai and Azure, and especially for our customers. We we'll be going to market together with a much better approach, starting with big media companies to distribute their, streaming and video assets. It's a coupling at the technology layer, which results in better performance. There's economic benefits to our customers to take advantage of it, you don't have a very large cost associated with getting content off of the storage off of as Azure on to Akamai CDN that you would have with other large cloud providers or CDN. That's a very big cost that people don't talk about, but really impacts our customer base. And so not only will they get better performance through this partnership, but they're going to get lower cost same time. And of course, adding Akamai's scale and Edge platform, which is close to all the end users in the video players and you greatly enhance the scale of the solution for big media companies. And so I think it's really exciting for our customer base and it's great to have such a cooperative relationship that I think will be good for Akamai and Azure. Brad Zelnick : That's great context. Thanks. And if I could sneak in one for Ed. Any help in appreciating your security performance across Web and Media customers? And are you still seeing benefit from the more aligned go-to-market with media? Edward McGowan : Absolutely. Yes. Great question. So again, both divisions grew very nicely in Q1 and we saw accelerated growth in the media space and continued to benefit from the alignment we did about a year and a half ago with the sales force. So very, very pleased with what we're seeing in both Media and Web. Brad Zelnick : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Michael Cheng : Hey guys. This is Michael Cheng on for Mark. Thanks for taking my question. I just have two, so I was wondering if you could provide any additional color on some of the turn trends you're seeing. Anything in particular that's driven this result. And then in terms of cloud security, given that and Nominum's fully lapped, would you stay that mid-to-high 20% growth is reasonable for this segment for the coming years? Thanks. Edward McGowan : Yes. The churn was again, very low in Q1 and very - we're talking low single-digits, so great work there. And of course, that helps in the growth of the business and very optimistic about the growth of our Cloud Security business, we forecasted mid-20s and we did better that in Q1 and you look at the potential for our Akamai identity cloud, which is powered by Janrain and organically developed Akamai capabilities and you look at our zero trust solution with our enterprise, security capabilities and there's a lot of potential for future growth there. Michael Cheng : Got it. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Anderson of Needham. Your line is now open. Alex Anderson : Perfect. Thank you very much. I know you guys to have a number of contracts that are coming up that are in process of renegotiation. And I was wondering, as the security businesses increasing as a percentage of the sale? Is that helps when you to offset some of the pricing pressure that you might have otherwise been enduring as a result of people being able to move content from CDN to CDN easier when they're not linked into the security? How much of that impact your pricing thoughts? Edward McGowan : Sure. I'll take that one. So in terms of the customers that came up for renewal, we mentioned on our last call, because it was notable, a little bit unusual in that we had a number of large media customers we consolidated in the industry and we're coming up for renewal. So that's why we had called it out and actually that's why you see the midpoint of the range down a bit from where we reported last quarter. What I would tell you is that that all, we had most of those reprice in Q1 and as far as our expectations came right in line with our expectations, maybe a touch better. We have a pretty good handle on the industry and what we expect in terms of pricing declines and renewals and whatnot. So I was happy to see that that came in as we expected. And as far as your question around security and the impact on pricing, I would say this - we have a strategy, especially in the Web Division where we're bundling security and Web Performance. And what's you see there is exactly what's you described where you will see pricing pressure typically in your Web Performance side of the business. And what our teams will do is bundle and security as a way to remain sticky, much more sticky I know location, but also what it does is while the Web Performance price may decline, you're able to maintain higher revenue levels then when you bundle in security. Alex Anderson : One more question if I could throw it in. So obviously, Fastly is now filed to come public, and there's obviously interest in competition as a result of these smaller companies coming out. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of pricing relative to the smaller competitors that are coming out? I know you talk about your YETI comments prior quarter, but has there been any change in behavior? Is my sense that the pricing is actually firmed around some of these new players in the category? Thomson Leighton : Yes. As you know, there's dozens of small CDNs out there, literally dozens. You mentioned Fastly, we see them some in the market. They're not among the leading CDN competitors that were battling day-to-day out there in the market and have been for a long, long time. The folks we see most out there and the ones that have been doing it 10 or 15 years and they're the ones that we would most often see in the market. Pricing, it's always competitive about there, and there's no change with that. And that's where we got a big advantage. We're highly profitable. We put a lot of effort into driving efficiency and that's not just at the operational level, but at the technical level. We can drive a tremendous amount of traffic out of each dollar of CPU, each dollar for power, and square foot of co-lo. And that gives us a huge advantage when a customer needs a price point, we can go in there and offer that price point and stay very profitable, whereas the competitors that you're talking about are losing a lot of money. And when you're tiny, you can get away with that for a little while, but it really is hard to scale and eventually you hit a wall that you just can't keep doing that. And that's why a lot of the little CDNs have really struggled to get a size of several hundred million dollars in revenue. When they're really small, you can pretty much make anything happen, but it becomes hard to grow the company. And also with our profit in the amount of money we're generating, we plow that back into development of new innovative technology, acquisitions of other companies that provide capabilities that our customers want. You see that in the context of the security business, and Ed talked about Protect & Perform. So when we go compete against, a lot of the other CDNs out there, we're in a great position with Protect & Perform and all the other capabilities we have. And the other CDNs just can't stack up to that. So when they're small, it's easy to show a little bit of growth, but hard to scale that. And at the end of the day, our major enterprise customers want to see a company they can rely on over the long haul. Alex Anderson : Great. Thank you very much for the answers. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Robert Gutman : Thanks for taking the questions. First, just revisiting the contract renewal. So is that completed in the first quarter? In other words, is there any more to come in the second quarter? And secondly, if you could talk about in the Web Division, it seems that the security aspect that is doing very well, if we get some color on the non-security products and the demand there and any progress you've made operationally? Thomson Leighton : Sure. So I'll take that one. In terms of the contracts completed, we've completed most of them in Q1. We've got another one to go here in Q2, but that's been factored into the guidance. Like I mentioned earlier, we've got a really good handle in terms of what goes on in the market and our pricing. So I anticipate that to come in line with what we're expecting. On the Web side, we don't break out our Web Performance product revenue anymore. Perhaps the best way to think about is if you look at our CDN, there is a proxy for Web Performance growth is probably fair. But in terms of some of the other products, we've seen great growth with our image manager product and continued growth with our performance management products, the DPM or Digital Performance Management product. So we're still seeing some really good growth outside of security with some of our newer Web Performance products. Our core Web Performance business as we talked about the area where we do see a bit of a pricing pressure. Robert Gutman : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits : Hey guys. Good evening. So Tom mentioned the traffic is growing faster than the Internet, so canning share on a traffic basis. But the CDN group down 1% and up 2% constant currency. It seems less clear that you're getting share on a revenue basis at least I'll use the CDN numbers. So is that because the performance pieces dragging us down or is it because of price declines on the immediate delivery side? Edward McGowan : Yes. So Mike, I think it's really three things here. One, there is some pricing declines as you as you're talking about. So that's one factor. The other thing is that we know which we're coming off a pretty seasonally strong quarter in Q4. But in terms of the CDN business as a whole, as you mentioned is growing about 2% and we expect to see that probably be flat to slightly declining as we worked through some of these pricing declines that we talked about with the renewals. But as Tom mentioned, we are gaining share and still growing. So we're offsetting our pricing declines. Thomson Leighton : Also as we package, performance and delivery and protect and perform packages, it does make it harder to allocate the revenue, which is why that we report the divisions overall. Obviously, the Web Division is Performance and Security products dominated, Media is dominated by delivery and in OTT has some security sales, but dominated by the delivery products. Because it's just hard when a customer buys the package protect and perform, to allocate the revenue. So some of the CDN probably is doing a little bit better than you might think. But generally flattish to low single-digits, I think is a fair estimate there. Michael Turits : Okay. And if I could have just one quick follow-up, you mentioned when we talked about the investment for next year in anticipation of uplift in OTT. You mentioned, Disney, but are there any other events we can talk about or launches that give you visibility of, because obviously there's all some risk investing add of these. Thomson Leighton : Sure. Yes. So another thing to keep in mind, Michael is it, next year was even years so we'll have an Olympics and we'll also have a presidential election. So in general and even years, we see along with that just additional traffic roads. So that's one thing to factor in. But there's been a number of other public publicized OTT offerings, NBC, Time Warner, et cetera. And as I've mentioned before, we have excellent relationships with all the folks that have been rumored to have OTT launches going into next year. And we feel very confident that we should be able to get a meaningful share of that business. Michael Turits : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Caroline Lu : Hi, this is Caroline Lu on for Heather. Just quickly back on the cloud security business. I might have missed the response to Keith's question, but is all of that revenue subscription at this point? And then based on the fact that Janrain contributed, I think you said $4 million this quarter, could you share with us your expectation for Janrain for the full-year? Thomson Leighton : Yes, sure. I'll take the last part. So Janrain, as we talked about on the last call at about approximately $20 million. And we still believe that still the right number for the year. Edward McGowan : And security is the bulk of that is subscription. There are examples I guess with very large customers that can have a traffic component, but most all of that subscription and probably will become increasingly so. So you can think of security subscription business. Caroline Lu : Got it. And then I'm back to - I guess pricing and the Performance segment. A few quarters ago you mentioned retail weakness. Is that still the case or is anything changing there? Thomson Leighton : Yes. So that's still the case. And the U.S. retail market in particular is under an enormous amount of pressure. So are a couple of additional bankruptcies this year in the U.S. retail market. And what I would say about that is we haven't seen anything dramatically change in terms of the level of pricing compression. So it's relatively consistent in what we factored into our guy going forward. Caroline Lu : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael : Great. Two questions if I may. One just following up on the Security business. So the Security business is up $5 million a quarter over quarter, and you've mentioned obviously now a few times that Janrain was 4 million, so it was up 1 million. I need organic basis and as you mentioned, it's a subscription business. The 1 million sequential increase doesn't seem to align with guidance for plus 20% growth through the years. I was hoping you can give us a little bit more color on that. And then secondly, your U.S. business has been obviously, roughly flat for a while now and it was down I think slightly in the first quarter and obviously that's very different than what we're seeing internationally. And I would have thought that with the big six Internet customers outperforming in the quarter, we would actually have seen the US businesses see a step up in its growth since I assume that's where the majority of traffic for those types of customers is coming from. But we can see that. So I'm trying to understand, what is it about the U.S. business that's fundamentally a structurally so much different than the results that we're seeing outside of us. Thank you. Thomson Leighton : Sure. I'll take the first one, first question or second question first. In terms of the U.S. business, if you look at year-over-year, last year we have the benefit of the Olympics in Q1 and also we had Nominum and as I mentioned we had a very strong Q4 and Nominum last quarter and are a little bit lower than expected here in Q1, where last Q1 we had a pretty quarter with Nominum's you get reference. The another thing in keep in mind to is that in the U.S. that's where we have our biggest for challenge when the Web business, where our U.S. retailers are. So we've seen, you know, some, some continued pressure in that area. So that's, those are really the things that kept our U.S. growth down. And in terms of, the way to think about the international growth, that's an area that we're going to continue to invest in. We've been, for many quarters now in a row, we've seen significant growth in Asia as well as in Europe. And there's large opportunities in places like the Middle East and Latin America. So we're very bullish on the international growth and I think as we look at the remainder of the year for the U.S. as I mentioned earlier some of those large customers that we're consolidating, most of them are in the U.S. So I'd expect to see that flattish to slightly down in the U.S. here for a couple of quarters until we start to see a growth accelerate going into next year. And then your other question was on Security. If you look sequentially, you're right we're off above $5 million a quarter-to-quarter some of that is from Janrain. Remember I mentioned earlier that we did have a lot higher room, not a lot, but we had higher revenue and Nominum and Q4 and lower than expected revenue in Q1. So when you normalize that just back to somewhat of a normal sequential growth, maybe a little bit less than what you've seen in Q3 and Q4 last year, but a pretty decent clip. And we're still calling from mid-20s security growth year-over-year. Colby Synesael : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from James Fish of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. James Fish : Hey, congrats on a great quarter. Just wanted to sneak in a few here. A big question we're getting a round pretty much your anniversarying the Epic Games or Fortnite when in Q2 here. Are there any customers at this point that are more than 2% of revenue and not specifically Epic Games, but maybe you can talk about the IT guys especially because they came back this quarter. And then secondly on the Enterprise application access product. What are you seeing in terms of adoption now that you're doing both external and internal application access? Thanks. Thomson Leighton : Okay. Epic Game. So you talked about the anniversarying of Epic Games, which did launch here in and actually late Q1 early Q2. And then I think the question was on any customers over 2%. We don't break that out. But what I can tell you is we certainly don't have anyone even close to 10%. And we're seeing continued strong growth in Gaming. So Epic or Fortnite has really started the trend that a lot of other companies are trying to replicate. And as I mentioned, you're one of the strengths here in Q1 was due to Gaming and expect that to continue into the future. But one of the nice things about us relatives and some of our competitors is that we don't have a lot of customer concentration risk with any of our large customers. We have some large customers that that can bounce you around one quarter or another as they go through a renewal. But we don't have very significant customer concentration with anybody really. Edward McGowan : In terms of our Enterprise Security offerings, led by Enterprise application access and the zero trust architecture, having a lot of positive response to the architectural approach. I'd say it's early days, good growth revenue, doubled year-over-year in Q1. And we're very optimistic about the future. Now it's still early days, it will take time for traditional enterprises to migrate to the cloud-based security model and migrate from a network layer authentication and security model, which has been a tradition now for a long time to an application layer authentication and security model that's in the cloud. But very good discussions with customers. They're very interested. The analyst community is very supportive and we're seeing very strong revenue growth, but early days and still relatively small amounts of revenue. But as we look to the future, we think it's an important source of growth for us. James Fish : Thanks Tom. Thanks Ed. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from James Breen of William Blair. Your line is now open. James Breen : Thanks for taking the question. Could you just talk about where the growth is coming from with respect to existing customers versus new customers? And is a lot of the international growth coming from existing sort of U.S. customers that are expanding globally? Thanks. Edward McGowan : Sure. This is Ed. In terms of growth, obviously we've got such a huge installed base and a lot of growth does come from our existing customer base and that comes through additional traffic growth as well as selling more services to existing customers. So always find that the bulk of that typically will come from our existing customers. That said, we've had a couple of quarters here on a row of pretty significant new customer bookings, now of course, we're growing off a really big base, so it's not a huge material number per se. But we've had made some changes in our go-to-market last year and we're starting to see some benefits of that, starting to see new customer growth, start to pick up a bit. In terms of the difference between the U.S. and International, in International, it's more of a greenfield opportunity as we're going into places like China, Indonesia and India. So there's a lot of new customer to acquire there. So new customer growth is probably a little bit stronger in our International markets that is in the U.S. James Breen : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sameet Sinha of B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open. Sameet Sinha : Yes, thank you. A couple of questions. Let me first start with enterprise security, you spoke about growth there. Do you think you need to make a Prolexic kind of an acquisition to kind of accelerate and provide you that sort of a momentum and brand name visibility in the industry? Secondly, talking about, I don't think we've specifically addressed this in a while, so let me ask this. Last year you had number of operational improvement initiatives within the company, including a consultant who was in there. Can you talk to us about where are you in that process? Are you done with all the improvements that you need to make? Are there a few things more in the recommendations that are yet to be kind of initiated? Thank you. Thomson Leighton : Yes. Obviously, we've been very happy with a Prolexic acquisition. I think it really did help accelerate the growth of our organically developed security business. And we've made several acquisitions in the security space that we've been happy with and continue to look for potential acquisition. I don't think we need to buy something at a very large scale to be successful in enterprise security. But it's an area we're looking closely at. And of course, we got to be cognizant of price points there. There's some pretty high evaluations in the enterprise security space, but it is an area that we continue to look at. And in terms of where we are with the operational improvement initiatives that something that we continue to work. We are very happy to see that we hit 30% in Q1. It's something that we're working on through the year and into next year. We have gotten benefit from our consulting engagement that's largely completed. But we are always focused on operational efficiencies and are investing in making our services be more efficient and how we allocate headcount and OpEx to focus that on the areas of greatest growth for the company. Sameet Sinha : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Talanian of Evercore. Your line is now open. Kenneth Talanian : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering, could you rank order the potential drivers that might cause you to exceed your security growth expectations factored into your guidance for the year? Thomson Leighton : Well, obviously we have to see how fast the Janrain revenue accelerates our Akamai identity cloud offer. We have to see how fast the adoption takes place for our Zero Trust Architecture. These are things that are hard to forecast exactly. They're very early stage and relatively small numbers today. But if those were to take off faster than we expect, that would help. Bot Manager, as I mentioned, has been extremely successful in the marketplace. Now up to about 400 customers. We expect that to continue to ramp during the year and if it ramps faster and that can be helpful. Ed, do you have\u2026 Edward McGowan : Yes. What I would say is obviously you've got, as Tom mentioned, Janrain and Zero Trust is working on small numbers. So in terms of impacting this year is going to be from our core KSD Bot management and Prolexic as the main driver. If you look further out with Janrain and with enterprise that would be future growth drivers along with continued growth. We still have a lot of opportunity on our installed base to be able to sell security. We had talked about, it was an earlier question on media. I know there was an area that we had identified year and a half ago, where there was a lot of opportunity and we've seen - we've been able to execute on that and still have a ways to go. So basically it's going to be from your core products and have a lot of room to go. And also from the new customer acquisition standpoint, most of our new bookings right now are coming from security. So we're leading with security. So it's a customer acquisition story as well. Kenneth Talanian : Great. And if I may just sneak one in. Your DSOs are a bit higher than historically. Was there anything that changed in linearity of your business? Edward McGowan : No. So it's funny if you go back a year ago, it's roughly the same thing. There's a couple of things going on with timing. We actually have a number of customers that are prepaying, so we send out some invoices for our customers who pay in advance for full-year. And if you look at the quality of the aging, the aging quality is fantastic. So it's really nothing in terms of electability or anything around that, and this is purely a normal jump we see in Q4 and Q1. Kenneth Talanian : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. Jeff Van Rhee : Great, thank you. Just a couple from me. I just want to go back to the sales sort of go-to-market changes. You mentioned that you've seen some impacts and some increase in capture from new customers. Is it on pace with what you expected? It's hard to get a sense of what the timing was when we should really see those impacts. But is it meeting your expectations as to where you thought we'd be at this point? Thomson Leighton : Yes. So in terms of the new customer acquisition, I'd say we're probably doing about as good as we expected. We made those changes about a year-ago. So it takes a while for it to take hold you investment in lead generation, inside sales account development and things like that. So - but in terms of how it's progressing so far, we're on pace, maybe a touch ahead. But again, it takes a while for that to become a more material number over time. Jeff Van Rhee : Okay. Got it. And then on the platforms, was the bulk of the sequential increase in platforms from one of those platform customers? Thomson Leighton : No, it was actually fairly well distributed. There was growth like I said, in all different parts of the business from the gaming downloads, from software downloads, from a video delivery. And as I mentioned, one thing just to be mindful of when you have things like download events, they can be a little bit seasonal. That's why I said if you'll look towards a Q2 and beyond thinking of flat to down $1 million or $2 million, probably the right way to be thinking about those customers for now. But I can tell you, I used to run that sales organization. The team is actively engaged with those customers and constantly looking for opportunities for growth and to the extent that we can become an extension of what they're doing and offer, whether it's security or additional scale and reach where there to do it. So we're certainly not giving up on this group of customers and help we can grow in the future. But now that said, we just want to be cautious as we think about guiding that going forward. Jeff Van Rhee : Got it. And one last, if I could, I recall sort of thinking back maybe even a decade ago, I recall hearing you guys talk about Edge compute. How has that changed now? Certainly a lot - maybe a lot more noise about Edge compute, but what does it mean to your business at this point? Thomson Leighton : Yes. So we have the ability for our customers to run applications on our Edge platform. We're increasing the investment there. Also this plays into our IoT Edge Connect platform where you can have really tens and hundreds of millions of devices maintain always on connections to the platform. Often they'll speak non-web protocols. And so we'll be supporting the ability to run logic for metadata for command and control, so that these devices can be monitored. You can have alerting based on it. Basically you want to think of Akamai's providing the kind of compute you need to manage applications in user devices and on our Edge platform, both for Web applications, but also IoT kinds of applications. What you won't see us do is, a generic kind of thing. We're just, CPU for any purpose at all. So you won't see us do to like an easy to kind of platform, it really needs to be material to our customer's businesses and managing applications and IoT devices. That's the sweet spot for us and you'll see that kind of capability on our Edge platform. Jeff Van Rhee : Got it. Great, thank you. Thomson Leighton : Candice, this is Tom. We have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from line of Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Brandon Nispel : Okay, great. Most have been answered. I just wanted to ask Tom, maybe, did you learn anything from Google Stadia announcement, regarding cloud gaming and maybe can you specifically talk about what type of discussions you're having with your customers? Then one for Ed. Headcount growth was a - headcount was down sequentially. Who's curious if you could update us on what your expectations are for total head count, uh, growth in 2019? Thanks. Edward McGowan : Yes. I don't think we learned anything in particular there. As we talked about, we work closely with pretty much all the major gaming companies. I think people have been talking about running games that the CPU for the games in the cloud data centers for a long time. There's always a question about how much financial sense that's makes. We work with pretty much all the major gaming companies and you know, I think managing the metadata associated with the consoles and the devices that are playing games makes sense for us. And we can do that through our IoT Edge Connect platform. But I don't know that there's going to be a lot of the streaming for the individual game necessarily coming from the cloud. People have been talking about that now. Our customers, we've been talking to about that for probably over a decade. In terms of your question on headcount, yes, headcount is down. You may know that we've had a couple of restructuring charges in the last couple of quarters as we've looked to optimize some of our investments, the invest in some areas and invest in others in terms of a headcount growth going forward. Tom talked about the opportunities and security. So as we - some of that savings from other areas be reinvested back in security as well as our go-to-market, especially in the international markets where we see significant opportunity. In terms of headcount growth, I expect headcount to grow a bit here as we've taking some of these actions. That filled up the attire workforce in terms of the making these investments. So that's also factored into our guide. If you recall, I talked about operating margins coming down and touch here in Q4 and then reaccelerating Q2 and Q3 and everything. Brandon Nispel : Great. If I could just follow-up, Tom, on your response to gaming, are there technical limitations for games to be streamed from a cloud location? It seems like Google has figured something out in terms of the latency issue that probably used to be a problem? Thomson Leighton : Well, obviously, if you're playing a multiplayer game, latency makes a big difference and so you need to be doing the stream, close to the end user. That would be the only technical constraints. There are economic considerations, if you're - it's a high quality game, you now have a stream for an individual user, where the CPU the user hasn't purchased, but sitting in the cloud and the experiences we've had talking to the major folks doing that over the last decade when they try to think about doing it at scale, the economics don't look so good. There's been some desire to do it, so in certain countries; maybe you don't have staff to the game. Maybe the game works on multiple devices. You don't want to have the players. And there's reasons you'd want to do it, but I haven't seen - I spend people talked about it for a long time. We can certainly handle the low latency aspect, but it's been more of the economics around it in terms of will that really take off at scale. Brandon Nispel : Great. Thank you. Tom Barth : Well, I wanted to thank everybody for joining us this evening. In closing, we will be presenting to several investor conferences and events throughout the quarter. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And thank you again for joining us and have a nice evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2019 Akamai Technologies Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Tom Barth : Great. Thank you, and good afternoon and thank you for joining Akamai's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on July 30, 2019. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the second quarter coming in above expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue was $705 million, up 6% over Q2 of last year and up 8% in constant currency. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $1.07 per diluted share, up 29% year-over-year and up 32% in constant currency. As has been the case in recent quarters, these very strong results were driven by the rapid growth of our cloud security and international businesses strong traffic growth in our media business and our continued focus on operational excellence. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in Q2 was 42%, up three points over Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29% also up three points over Q2 of last year. These results highlight the excellent progress that we've made towards our goal of achieving non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while continuing to invest in innovation and new products to drive our future growth. Our security portfolio was again the fastest-growing part of our business in Q2, achieving revenue of $205 million, up 34% year-over-year at constant currency. And Bot Manager continued to be our fastest selling new product in recent memory, with hundreds of customers and a revenue run rate now over $100 million per year. Bot Manager is designed to defend websites and applications from bot attacks of all kinds, including credential abuse, account takeover and theft. It's been recognized as a market leader by top analyst firms such as Forrester and Frost & Sullivan and it's tightly integrated with another of our industry-leading security solutions Kona Site Defender. Kona Site Defender provides a Web Application Firewall or WAF service that is designed to protect websites and applications from downtime, defacement and corruption of content, insertion of malware and theft of data. Kona has been recognized as a market leader by numerous analyst firms, including Gartner, Forrester and IDC. And in its research report on critical capabilities for cloud WAF, Gartner rated Akamai as the best among all vendors at protecting critical business applications and mobile applications. Akamai's leadership in WAF services is important, because having a state-of-the-art and well-managed Web app firewall is vital for any major enterprise doing business on the Internet. Well over 1,000 customers are using Kona Site Defender today generating more than $300 million per year in revenue. In addition to Bot Manager and Kona, we also have a third market-leading security product that's generating more than $100 million in annual revenue and that's Prolexic. Prolexic provides protection from DDoS attacks to hundreds of customers, including many of the world's largest financial institutions. As a result, Akamai's been recognized as a market leader in DDoS mitigation by analyst firms such as Forrester and IDC. As you can see from the customer accounts that I just provided, there's plenty of room for more adoption of Kona, Prolexic, and Bot Manager by our installed base customers. These products are also driving a lot of our new customer acquisition. We're also very excited about the growth potential of our two newest security offers, Akamai Identity Cloud and Akamai Enterprise Defender. Akamai Identity Cloud, which was formerly known as Janrain Identity Cloud, provides a complete suite of consumer identity and login management services. It's been recognized as the overall leader in the consumer identity and access management space by KuppingerCole, Europe's leading research firm in this area. Identity management was a key theme at our recent Edge World Customer Conference, where we were joined by a senior executive from Sanofi to explain why they selected Akamai Identity Cloud to manage identities across their global business. Sanofi is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with operations in 170 countries and they chose Akamai Identity Cloud over the competition and in part because of its superior performance, enhanced security and ease of use. Akamai Enterprise Defender, which we formally launched at Edge World in June, is designed to provide a robust zero trust solution to protect enterprise applications from unauthorized access and data breaches. It's comprised of our Enterprise Application Access, Enterprise Threat Protector and Kona Site Defender products. These products become even more essential as major enterprises move their data into the cloud, where it can be more challenging to ensure that proper access controls are in place. It's still early days for zero trust but already Akamai's enterprise security solutions are drawing attention in the marketplace. For example, Forrester cited Akamai as a powerhouse of capability in its report on zero trust providers. Gartner cited Akamai in its market guide for zero trust network access, recommending that enterprises phase out legacy VPN access for high-risk use cases and begin phasing in zero trust access. And we're continuing to see significant customer wins at major enterprises like SKF. SKF is the world's largest manufacturer of bearings with 44,000 employees worldwide and they're now replacing their traditional VPN with our Enterprise Application Access solution. In addition to having great products, Akamai's security portfolio is supported by great people in our services and support organization. We've heard of many instances where a misconfigured or outdated product has been the route to a data breach and this is an area where our hundreds of security experts can help. Akamai's substantial security expertise can make the difference between operating safely and suffering a devastating breach, especially as enterprises make greater use of public cloud infrastructure. Akamai has six security operation centers around the world where vulnerabilities and attacks are detected and mitigated by our security experts before they can cause harm. Well over 1000 customers, including many large financial institutions, retailers and media companies, now use our managed security services and this generates another $100 million plus in annual revenue for Akamai. Overall, we're very pleased with the success that we're having with our security portfolio and we believe that the best is yet to come. Our customers are now telling us that they see Akamai as more than just the world's largest CDN. Many view us as an Internet security partner and strategic adviser, whose cybersecurity capabilities work hand-in-hand with our delivery offerings. As a sign of this important evolution in our business, security accounted for 29% of our revenue in Q2, up from 23% a year ago. And we believe that we're on track to achieve a $1 billion run rate for our security solutions in the next year. As measured by security revenue, Akamai is now one of the world's largest public cybersecurity companies and arguably the largest when it comes to providing cloud security services. Changing topics, I'd now like to say a few words about our Media business, which also performed well in the second quarter. We continue to grow traffic faster in Q2 than published growth rates for the Internet as a whole, which means that we continue to gain share. Online viewing of live sports in particular has grown dramatically this year. On July 9, the ICC's Cricket World Cup semifinal between India and New Zealand attracted over 25 million concurrent viewers to the Akamai platform. That's 36% more than our previous record set in May and it's triple the peak that we reached in May of last year. The growth in video traffic and the enormous scale provided by Akamai's unique Edge platform were major topics of interest at our customer conference. There was also substantial interest in how our Edge platform will provide even greater benefit to our customers as 5G becomes widespread. That's because 5G is expected to connect hundreds of millions of people and many billions of devices to the Internet. And once 5G is deployed at scale, it should vastly improve the bandwidth and latency in the last mile. But to take advantage of this capability and to not be overwhelmed by the resulting increase in traffic, you need servers close to the last mile at the Edge of the Internet and this is where Akamai really is unique with 4,000 points of presence in more than 1,000 cities across 140 countries. It's taken a while, but the industry has now come to recognize that having infrastructure at the Edge is critical for scale, performance and security. Of course now that leading analysts are talking about the importance of the Edge, several of our competitors are suddenly claiming to have Edge networks and Edge services too. But they aren't at the Edge at all. They're located in tangent data centers in the core of the Internet just as they've always been. Looking back at Q2, we're very pleased with our results and the strong momentum that we've established in the first half of the year. It's very good to see the impressive revenue growth for our security products, the high traffic growth in our CDN business, our strong growth and opportunity in international markets and our continued robust operating margins. We're especially pleased that our non-GAAP EPS grew more than 30% in constant currency for the fifth consecutive quarter even while we continue to invest in innovation and new products to drive our future growth. In Q2, we also welcomed Madhu Ranganathan to our Board. Madhu has extensive financial experience at global software, networking and services companies and we're very pleased to have her join our Board's Audit and Finance Committees. Now we'll turn the call over to Ed to review our Q2 results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. As Tom outlined Akamai delivered another excellent quarter in Q2. We were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on revenue, operating margin and earnings and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal of 30% non-GAAP operating margins in 2020. Q2 revenue was $705 million up 6% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency driven by strong security growth and higher-than-expected OTT video traffic. Revenue from our Web division was $380 million up 8% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency. Revenue growth for this group of customers continued to be driven by our strong security business where we saw strong performance across multiple security offerings including Bot Manager, Kona Site Defender and Prolexic. In addition, we continue to see a very solid year-over-year growth in both the Asia Pacific region and in EMEA. Revenue from our Media and Carrier Division was $325 million up 4% year-over-year or 6% in constant currency. The better-than-expected growth in Q2 came from continued very strong momentum in security and higher-than-expected OTT video traffic as we gain share in a few key customers during the quarter. Revenue from the Internet Platform Customers, which is included in our Media and Carrier Division was $46 million up 5% from the prior year. Q2 revenue from this group of customers was slightly ahead of our projections due to higher-than-expected download in video traffic. Turning now to our total company security products revenue. Security revenue for the second quarter was $205 million up 32% year-over-year or 34% in constant currency. We are very pleased to see that our significant investments in security are paying off. Moving on to revenue by geography. Sales in our international markets continue to be strong and represented 41% of total revenue in Q2 up 3 points from Q2 2018 and consistent with Q1 levels. International revenue was $288 million in the second quarter up 15% year-over-year or 20% in constant currency. We again saw strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region and continued steady results in our EMEA region. As Tom mentioned earlier, we have seen significant traction with our investments overseas and we plan to continue to invest internationally in order to take advantage of our unmatched global scale, reach and product portfolio. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $2 million on a sequential basis and $11 million on a year-over-year basis. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $417 million up 1% year-over-year which is a two point improvement from year-over-year growth in the first quarter. Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 77% down 1 point from Q1 levels and consistent with the same period last year. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 66% consistent with Q1 levels.  Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $254 million, up $1 million from Q1 levels and slightly below our guidance due to continued focus on operational efficiencies and some early returns from our enhanced procurement function we introduced earlier this year. Now moving on to profitability, adjusted EBITDA was $293 million, down $6 million from Q1 level, but up $31 million or 12% from the same period in 2018. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 42% consistent with Q1, up 3 points from Q2 2018 and above the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was $204 million, down $5 million from Q1 levels, but up $34 million or 20% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, down 1 point from Q1 levels, up 3 points from Q2 last year, and above our high -- above our guidance range. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $153 million. This was slightly below our guidance range due to some spend related to our new headquarters that shifted into Q3. Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the second quarter was $114 million or $0.69 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $176 million or $1.07 of earnings per diluted share, up 29% year-over-year or up 32% in constant currency and $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $34 million based on a Q2 effective tax rate of 16%. This effective tax rate is 1 point lower than our guidance due to a higher percentage of foreign earnings. Now, I will discuss some balance sheet items. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet. As of June 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, totaled $1.3 billion, up $109 million from the end of Q1, an increase driven by strong free cash flow of $185 million or 26% of revenue. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $1.2 billion, reflecting the senior convertible notes that will be due in May of 2025. Now I will review our use of capital. We continue to focus on the importance of returning capital to shareholders. During the second quarter, we spent $81 million on share repurchases buying back approximately 1.1 million shares. Our aim remains to fully offset our equity compensation dilution during 2019. We have approximately $1 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. We intend to continue return a large percentage of free cash flow through share repurchases, balanced against preserving our flexibility for strategic opportunities. We believe our disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach will allow us to continue to drive shareholder value through investing organically in the business, pursuing M&A and continued share repurchases. In summary, we are very pleased with our Q2 and first half results, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long-term. I'd now like to provide Q3 guidance and update our previous 2019 guidance. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we are projecting another solid quarter on both the top and bottom lines. As a reminder, in Q3, we faced the normal summer month traffic seasonality, especially in our Media business. And we expect further FX headwinds. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact of approximately $4 million to $5 million compared to Q3 of 2018, and a negative impact of approximately $1 million sequentially. Therefore, we are estimating Q3 revenues to be in the range of $692 million to $706 million, up 4% to 6% in constant currency over Q3 2018. It is worth noting that we renewed two of our Internet Platform Customers at the end of Q2. We expect our Internet platform accounts to decline in Q3 by approximately $4 million, which we have factored into our guidance. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% to 78%. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $257 million to $261 million. This uptick from second quarter spend levels is driven by the expiration of the Limelight patent royalty payments, higher expenses related to our new headquarters facility and our annual employees' salary merit increase, which takes place at the beginning of Q3. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectation, I just provided, we anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins in the range of 40% to 41%. Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $89 million to $91 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27% to 28% for Q3. Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $170 million to $178 million excluding equity compensation in the third quarter. This includes approximately $31 million related to the continued build-out of our new headquarters as well as a more significant network investment in anticipation of increased OTT traffic in 2020. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.98 to $1.02 or up 6% to 11% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $32 million to $36 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of 165 million shares. Looking ahead to the full-year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. On the revenue side, we are increasing our range to $2.84 billion to $2.87 billion, which is an increase of approximately $15 million at the midpoint of the range compared to our previous guidance. As a reminder, Q4 tends to have the widest range of outcomes given the large role that holiday seasonality plays with both online retail activity for our e-commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. For the full-year, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA margins of 41% to 42%. We expect 2019 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 28% to 29%. Moving on to CapEx. Full-year, CapEx is expected to be 20% to 21% of revenue. And included in our CapEx spend is roughly $100 million of onetime costs related to the buildout of our new headquarters. Excluding this spend we project the full year CapEx to be at the high end of our long-term model of 16% to 17% due to increased network build-out in anticipation of more significant OTT traffic in 2020. Moving on to EPS. We are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share range to $4.23 to $4.30 for the full year 2019 which is up $0.14 at the midpoint compared to our previous guidance. Our guidance assumes a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16% to 17% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. In summary, we are pleased with our performance of the business in the first half of 2019 as well as our ability to again increase our guidance for the full year. Thank you. And Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Pardon me, Brandon, please check your mute button. Brandon Nispel : Sorry. Yeah, it was on mute. Can you guys update your guidance in terms of the CDN revenue growth and the Cloud Security revenue growth for this year? Then maybe if you could also just break down what the enterprise security is with the new business that would be great? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Yes, so this is Ed. I'll take that. So for the cloud security business, we had previously guided the mid-20% range. We now take that up to mid to high 20% range. And the CDN will still be flattish for the year. So in enterprise security, so we don't break out enterprise security as of now. That's still a pretty small percentage of our total security revenue. As it gets more material we'll break that out. Brandon Nispel : And then I guess a second follow-up. Has -- you announced some new agreements with two of your IPC customers. Can you just help us understand maybe the change in those agreements? And then any update on your thoughts in terms of the new streaming services that are coming in 2020? Thanks. Tom Leighton : Sure. So with the giants, the Internet platform customers I talked about having two customers that renew. This is pretty standard. It's really just a contract that comes up for renewal. We're just negotiating pricing. I talk about how we expect to see those customers decline in Q3, but I do expect that group of customers to grow from Q3 levels into Q2. We will pick up a little bit more share with one of them and we expect to see pretty strong seasonality in Q4 with the rest of them. But again, that's pretty normal. So as you think about that group that's customers the contracts come up for renewal we'll have the price down generally we get more traffic. But again, we'll be down $4 million roughly in Q3 and then up again in Q4. And in terms of the new streaming services, so I guess the best way to talk about this one is we talked earlier about how we had a number of customers that we're renewing in Q2, Q1 and Q2 that were large consolidations of the marketplace some of whom have announced new streaming offerings. The good news is that's now behind us. So we've renewed all of those customers. And we talked a bit about updating our CapEx to build out anticipation for what we expect to be some increase in demand. It's really hard to predict exactly how successful these launches will be. We'll have to wait and see. Tom and I talked about, being cautious here. And making sure that, we build out and advance. So to the extent there is volume, we're there to take as much volume as we can. And to the extent that it doesn't pan out our core traffic is growing so we can just grow into that additional CapEx. So I think we're really well prepared for it. We'll give you an update certainly on our Q4 call, as we start to see some of this traffic come online in Q4. And we'll get a better sense of what the next year looks like. Brandon Nispel : Great, thanks Ed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : Yeah, thanks. Hi guys. Wanted to see if you can give us an update on, what's the early progress and traction with Janrain or now the Akamai Identity Solution? Tom Leighton : Doing well and grew the quarter. It's still early days. We're integrating it with our Bot Manager Solution, to provide a more comprehensive capability. And understanding really who is logging in, making sure it's the person we expect. Managing the user's data, in a secure way, so it can't be stolen, but I would say, early days, and looking positive. Sterling Auty : And then, one follow-up on the media side, I think there is a comment about gaining share in some key customers. Is there some additional color that you can give us on that front? Ed McGowan : Yeah. Sure Sterling. Yeah during the quarter we actually and with some of our U.S. customers were able to pick up additional share. In the Media space, the share shifts based on number of factors. One of which is better performance. And the Media team's done a great job of really focusing with some of those large customers, on improving performance specifically for the use type that they have, whether it be live video, or video that's on various devices, so that we can pick up some additional share. So we were pretty happy to see that, that part of what put us over the range for the quarter. Sterling Auty : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Great, thank you so much for taking my question. I had 2 if I may. First one was going to be, you obviously mentioned the growth with the Internet Platform Customers on that CDN side. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about, the trends in the business ex-the big 5. With that segment being down, I think it was 2% year-over-year this quarter and down 2% last quarter. Is there anything you can give us color on, about how we should expect the balance of that business ex the big 5 to trend? And then, just had a follow-up on, the Janrain, question. Was wondering who you're typically seeing in competitive RFPs with them? And if there's any update on, revenue contribution if it did better than your expectations for the quarter. Thank you. Ed McGowan : Yeah. Heather, I'll take the first one here on the business excluding the giants. So yes you're correct it was down, 1% or 2% this quarter. And that was as expected. We had talked about earlier, how we have some major customers on the media side that were we were renewing in Q1 and Q2. So that has is as expected. And given they were kind of getting into a seasonally, low quarter expect that to be flattish. You probably increase 1% or 2% in Q4 with our strong seasonality. But I think another way to look at it is, what is a catalyst that can potentially drive that business higher and I think as we look at 2020, you've got a number of factors whether it's the an even year where you have more traffic associated with things like the Olympics, the presidential Olympic -- the presidential election excuse me. And you also have a number of OTT offerings. So in that business where it's primarily driven by traffic, traffic growth offsets, your pricing is decline that's essentially the math there. So, when a year where you see accelerating traffic, that's when you start to get into a bit of acceleration in growth. So that's what we'll be looking for. Tom Leighton : Yeah. And in terms of Janrain, the large majority of our prospects were competing with a homegrown solution, or do-it-yourself. And the challenge they're seeing is they grow their business of scaling the homegrown solution, getting performance out of it. It can be hard to use and security is a big deal. And you're dealing with very personal user data. And so security is really important there. When we do see a competitor come into the account typically it would be Gigya, we'd see and occasionally Okta. Okta really works more on the enterprise side of the house. But they do have some capability on the consumer side. And I would say, most often it's a do-it-yourself solution that the customer has. And the revenue question, yeah our revenue there is in line with expectations. Heather Bellini : Great, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Horan for Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Tim Horan : Thanks guys. Tom any more color on edge-based compute? Do customers understand how unique your infrastructure is? And are they starting to utilize it or maybe what applications or just any other color? When it might really start to take off? Thanks. Tom Leighton : Yeah. We've been supporting edge compute in various forms for almost 20 years. At our Edge World Customer Conference we talked a lot about our new Edge worker solution which gives them even greater capabilities over and above Edge side and includes in cloudlets. And we also demonstrated -- our new IoT Edge Connect solution which has message broker support -- MQTT support and also compute at the Edge in the IoT model. So there's a lot of interest in that. I think the interest will increase more especially as you see more IoT applications out there. There was a lot of buzz among our customers as talking about the IoT applications they're working on. Clothing companies or sneaker companies talking about putting sensors in your shoes or clothes. Our airline customers are sensing when you get to the airport so they can update you automatically on your flight. Merchandisers tagging items for sale so they can keep track of it and have automated checkout. So -- and I think 5G is going to help enable a lot of these applications that people are talking about now. And that -- Edge compute is a big part of that because you have to do a processing of data sometimes at a massive scale, latency can make a big difference especially with gaming consoles or automobiles when those are the devices that are on the Internet of things. And I do think people are really starting to realize just how important our Edge platform is. And not just for delivering content, but doing compute and certainly for security. Tim Horan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Sanjit Singh : Thank you. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith. And congrats on the great security results this quarter. I actually had a question on the OTT business. I was wondering if you give us a sense of how your typical OTT deal is structured in terms of are those typically single source, dual source or triple sourced. And then in terms of thinking about how is revenue contracted if that going to be a pure function of subscribers or are there sort of minimum contracts associated with some of these streaming services that are being launched in the coming months? Ed McGowan : Sure. So I'll take that one, Tom. There really is no typical deal they're all pretty unique. Most customers in the large OTT space do use multiple source whether they do it themselves or have multiple CDNs. Your typical contract if there is such a thing it really depends. I mean, typically we'll sign-up for anywhere from one year to two years contract length volume based pricing based on the traffic that comes over the network when it comes into delivery. All of our other services whether its security, professional services et cetera are priced in a different manner. And in terms of the, I guess, the volume commitment that can vary as well. And that also is a factor in terms of the unit pricing. In this world, we're trying to get as much share as you possibly can given the fact that we've got the most amount of capacity and we've got capacity in all the right places around the world. We typically do pretty well in a multi-CDN environment in terms of getting share. That's basically the way those OTT contracts work. Sanjit Singh : Understood. Then maybe a follow-up question maybe on the topic of taking share. I think for a number of years now what we're used to is when big contracts come up for renewal that gives an opportunity for Akamai to take share. But that results in a little bit of a revenue headwind. I mean in the near-term are there any initiatives, I think, you guys described this a little bit at the investor meeting a couple of months ago, the initiatives to sort of smooth that cadence out. I think you have zero coverage out there, but what are the things that could be done to maybe create less of a revenue headwind when some of these contracts can't get repriced? And anything that can be done on that side of the house? Ed McGowan : Yes, great question. So I think one of the things that we've seen and the Media team has done a great job here of selling security. It was a vertical where we didn't have a lot of security penetration. And we've seen enormous growth in our security business across many sell verticals within the media space whether it's your OTT video space, your publishers, your gaming customers et cetera.  So what does that fills in some of the hole in terms of the revenue decline. Because obviously, you'd take a price decline and then traffic will ramp over time. Generally, as I talked in the earlier question around commitments sometimes getting larger commitments to get guaranteed share is a way to also offset some of the revenue declines. Sanjit Singh : Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. Just looking at the difference in growth rates across the different geographies. Obviously, the U.S. has been much slower for some time now relative to various international geographies. Is the slower growth in the U.S. really just a function of the maturity of the business model in this market, or is it really a reflection of just a greater level of competition that you're seeing? And I'm speaking ex the big 6. And then secondly as it relates to the big 6, I had in my notes that you were expecting one price renewal in the second quarter. I could have had that wrong. And I think you said that there were two. Just what that is that the backdrop, are there any other large big six price renewals that you are anticipating for the remainder of this year? Thank you. Ed McGowan : Why don't we take the last question first, so in terms of the price renewals, we had talked about -- we actually didn't call out the big six price renewals. And the reason we didn't do that was given the fact that there's only six customers, so we don't want to single that out. What we had talked about was, there were a number of consolidations, we talked about the beginning of the year that were up for renewal in Q1 and Q2 so there was one remaining in Q2 and that is now done. So we're done with that. As far as the question on the big 6, what I would say is, any activity that we anticipate in the big six has been factored into our guidance. I don't want to get into specifics of additional timing around revenue but I did talk about declining revenue this quarter related to the renewals we did in Q2 and then in Q4 we expect to grow. In the U.S., the question around U.S. growth, just couple of things to keep in mind with the U.S. growth rate. This is the area within the Web business where we have the most pressure from a macroeconomic standpoint with our U.S. commerce retail vertical, which is a pretty significant vertical for us so that's put some pressure on the U.S. growth. This is also where those renewals I talk about in Media sit as well where you've got some price pressure we have to go through here in the first half of the year. So that's also put some pressure on our growth rate as well. And I just if you look at some compares last year in Q1, we had the Olympics in Q1 of last year, which did not repeat this year as we saw some softness in Q1. And then also we had a very strong Nominum quarter in Q1 of last year which didn't repeat in Q1 this year and has been tread in line with what we expected here in Q2. So those are some of the factors that you have to take into consideration. Now I know you said you excluded the giants, but the giants are in the U.S. So anytime we see some pressure there, you'll see our total company U.S. growth rate decline a bit. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you very much, Ed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I've got two. First, what's giving you the incremental confidence from three months ago to tick up your CapEx into the back half of the year ahead of the OTT traffic you're expecting next year? And while I don't expect you'll provide guidance for next year, how would you frame the opportunity you're playing for in CDN? Perhaps your view of what the dollar market growth opportunity looks like? Ed McGowan : Yes, hey Brad. Yes, I don't want to provide specific guidance. The only reason I don't want to do that is just that it's somewhat out of our control the user adoption. Obviously, very, very powerful brands, which gives us confidence to say that we believe that there'll be some significant traffic to gain. We have good relationships with all the players that are announcing OTT offerings. We can't control the timing, we can't control the user adoption. So it's hard for us to sit here and say that there's a big number because it becomes somewhat binary. If I call out a big number in traffic for next year for one or two of those and it doesn't show up it's hard to make it out. So we'll update you in Q4 and much better view of guidance on revenue. On the CapEx side, it's a more simple calculation for us. As we look at planning out for our network build we've got a core business is growing fairly nicely from a traffic perspective. And strategically we want to be positioned to be able to take as much traffic as possible. If these services do take off and are widely successful, we are in a much better position because we have the largest network. We have the most capacity. We have capacity in the right locations. So strategically it makes sense for us to do that. As I mentioned, if we're wrong and the traffic doesn't really materialize, we can grow into it and take our CapEx down for next year so. Now as we talked about it as a team we thought it was the right bet to make to position us for that growth. And again, I just don't want to speculate right now until we start to see some of that traffic exactly how big that will be. Brad Zelnick : That's fair and I appreciate the color. And Ed it's good to hear today's commentary recommitting to 30% operating margins in 2020. But as we look beyond 2020, how do you think about the margin potential of the business? And is there any reason Akamai can't get back to the mid-30s type op margins where it was a decade or so ago? Ed McGowan : Yes, we're not going to give guidance beyond 2020 or a 30% operating margin. We also always want to operate as efficiently as we can and there are certainly scenarios where the margins could increase beyond 30%. But we're not going to give any comments on that today. Brad Zelnick : Fair enough. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from James Fish from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. James Fish : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and awesome quarter. One thing as I look at your Q3 guide for the top line, you're guiding down sequentially and yet Akamai has really never been going -- has never had a sequential decrease from Q2 to Q3. Can you just help us bridge that? Ed McGowan : Sure. So one of the items is the fact that you have the giants, the Internet Platform Customers, excuse me, that are down will be down about $4 million sequential so you take that into consideration. Now the other thing is the FX headwinds, we're expecting at least another $1 million of headwind there. That's something just to dig in a little bit on the FX side, you've got about 40% of our business is outside the U.S. and not all of that is in non-U.S. dollar now maybe of that is. And we've got if you think about our major currencies, you've got the euro, the yen and the pound as the three big ones. And there's obviously a lot of pressure, especially in the pound. So, some FX headwinds there. And then the other thing, if you remember from last Q3, we had the World Cup. So that added some extra dollars into Q3 of last year. So you factor all that together, you can see why we're still guiding to at the midpoint down slightly at the high end roughly flat. James Fish : Got you. And then one more for Tom probably, maybe could you talk about how the new online gaming streaming services that are coming out, can you about how Akamai can monetize on that traffic, and what needs to be done from a tech perspective in order to deliver that traffic with nearly zero latency given the nature of online gaming? Tom Leighton : Well, yeah, you'd have to be delivering it from the Edge that's where we're located. So, we're in good position to help with that. And I think we have a great relationship with a lot of the gaming companies. I think in terms of Google's service, they probably do it themselves. We've really been having discussions about that capability for probably over a decade now with some of the world's largest gaming companies. And the challenge, I think, for them is the economics. In terms of who's paying for the CPU, who's paying for the bandwidth, who's paying for the co-lo. Now, Akamai can certainly handle the streaming with very low latency and at scale, and do a really good job of it. So if this does take off, that's a source of increased traffic for Akamai, which is a good thing. James Fish : Great. Thanks. Great quarter, guys. Tom Leighton : Thanks. Ed McGowan : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Great. Two questions please. I know a couple have already asked about Janrain, but just to nail the point down. You're still expecting about $20 million in revenue from that this year, and the contribution in the June quarter was roughly $4 million to $5 million. Is that correct? Ed McGowan : That's correct, Mark. It was about $5.5 million for the quarter, and we're still expecting approximately $20 million for the whole year. Mark Mahaney : And then Tom, you had mentioned 5G early on. And maybe paint that picture a little bit more -- with a little bit more detail like, when do you think that could become material in the field, and when you think it could be material? Like I get the Akamai pitch of you need have to servers at the Edge, and there -- this really could open up a new era of even more intense applications and we're realizing today, and IoT is probably getting to the forefront of that. But when do you think you can actually come through for Akamai in terms of material new wins or more business with existing customers? Any more color on that would be appreciated. Thank you. Tom Leighton : Yeah. I think it'll be gradual. And to coincide with the gradual deployment of 5G around the world, basically the way to think of 5G is it increases the throughput at the last mile and it decreases the latency. Now increasing the throughput, and also it gets more people connected. Now doing that increases the demand for traffic, and that's just existing business growing faster because of 5G. Having in addition, the decreased latency and the better scale in terms of how many connections can be supported, does help to enable IoT kinds of applications, and that's where I think you can see things that maybe we haven't even thought about yet in terms of IoT. To this point IoT has been a little bit of a buzzword. And I think just judging from what I see in the customer base, that's going to start to get more real. And you need to take advantage of that low latency that means you got to have servers at the Edge where Akamai is. And so, we're in a great position, especially with our IoT Edge Connect platform to support those applications at scale with low latency and to offer Compute at the Edge. So, I think it will be not all at once. It will be sort of a steady growth both for our organic business and for new applications in our IoT Edge Connect platform, that's now just a question in early days. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff van Rhee from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. Jeff Van Rhee : Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. A few for me. On the retail commerce side of the business, could you talk about the dynamics in that space, particularly the competitive landscape? And then, just some thoughts maybe on how you see growth rates trending over the next few years. Tom Barth : Well, there's certainly a lot of competition in the CDN space, and always has been. I think the fundamental change is that our customer's under pressure, from Amazon in particular and that puts them in a harder position. And so that decreases their business and put pressure on our revenue as really a flagship vertical for Akamai. They still need our services. They still need the best performance. They really need security and they want that of course as a packaged capability and that helps us. And that's why I think our churn is incredibly low. So despite the fact they're under pressure, we do have some of them going bankrupt. We see very little loss to any of the many competitors that are trying to get some of that business. A very, very high percentage of the major retailers out there use Akamai. And I -- every indication is that that should continue, but their businesses are under pressure. And that puts our revenue under pressure. Tom Leighton : If I could just add something on this in terms of your question around growth, Tom mentioned the pressure will still continue on the core business on the delivery business. But the Web team's done a great job of going in and selling security similar to what I talked about with the Media team and should see some of these price declines our security revenue in the commerce space is growing, which is great. So taking the pressure on the acceleration business, but augmenting some of that in the security side. Jeff van Rhee : Got it. Great. And then on the enterprise side, just can you talk about the sales motion close rates as you develop that sales org? Just maybe some color as to how that organization has matured what still needs to be done? Tom Leighton : Yeah. We have a advanced technology group that they have expertise on the enterprise security side of the house. And they've worked with the reps on our existing accounts and new prospects. So it's -- I would say a typical sales motion for a new capability. It's early days for zero trust. You're now talking to enterprises who manage their enterprise security one way for a long, long time. There is the notion of the moat around the castle perimeter defense and it doesn't work anymore. And it's going to take them some time to really change, and so we're seeing early major enterprise wins, which is great. And we're growing -- the bookings are increasing year-over-year. And I think there will come a time in the not-too-distant future where we really see very strong growth here. Already the major analysts are out there zero trust is the way to go I gave some quotes during my prepared remarks. And Akamai is clearly one of the early leaders with this capability. Jeff van Rhee : And just one last one if I could. Any update on the blockchain initiative both timing and the scope? Tom Leighton : No particular update. We're really excited about our partnership GO-NET our joint venture with MUFG. And their goal now is to be offering this as a service in Japan in early next year. So we're about a year out from commercial adoption, and so far so good. Jeff van Rhee : Good. Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is now open. Alex Henderson : Great. Thanks. I was hoping you could spend a little bit of time unpacking the 20% constant currency growth internationally. Is that a function of security uptake? Is it a function of share? Is it the higher traffic volumes internationally? Can you break those down and maybe rank order what the drivers were? Ed McGowan : Sure. So as we look at the growth outside of the U.S. the nice thing is that both EMEA and APJ are going in double-digits. Asia in particular we're really seeing strong growth really across everything you talked about. We're seeing some pretty interesting initiatives in the media side. We're picking up lots of traffic. And with security we're really seeing great growth across both EMEA and APJ and across many different countries. If you remember a number of years ago, we started to make investments in our sales force and grew our sales force outside of the U.S. and that's really starting to pay dividends for us. So it's a number of factors. I think one of the things in terms of competing in the marketplace making that large investment in our go-to-market, our services and our support organization have 24/7 support to something that really does help differentiate us in the marketplace. Also, our investments in the countries, where a lot of these companies operate, and where some of their end-users are also separates us in the marketplace. And we're finding really good growth in a number of countries across the world. Alex Henderson : So can you rank order those factors share gains, volume, security uptake? What was the largest driver? Ed McGowan : I would say, it's probably a combination of traffic growth and security. Alex Henderson : Great. And could you do something similar for where the upside was within the security business. Obviously, security was very strong and accelerated. Where was the upside and was the growth evenly distributed across the product lines? Ed McGowan : Sure. So great question. We did expect to see strong sequential growth quarter-over-quarter, but this was stronger than we had originally modeled in. Part of that is related to some comments we made earlier last quarter around our bookings and that the majority of our bookings now are coming from security sales both to existing and new customers. And our services team did a great job of getting a lot of these customers, revenue generating earlier than what our model would suggest. So we had more a month's worth of revenue in the quarter. Also our Web Division had an acceleration in year-over-year growth rate across many verticals. I mentioned the commerce verticals were seeing very nice growth, but also across financial services public sector high-tech, so great participation across a number of verticals. Also, to Tom's earlier point in his earlier remarks, we've got strength across multiple products and we saw a great quarter-over-quarter growth in Bot Manager, Kona Site Defender and Prolexic, also Janrain added up quarter-over-quarter about $1.5 million. Compare our Q1 results to Q2. So, really just strength across the board both here in the U.S. and also outside the U.S. Alex Henderson : So the upside was across the board then? I thought Janrain was in line for instance. Ed McGowan : Yes, Janrain was in line about the same. If you look at sequential growth quarter-over-quarter, as I started saying, we expected to have pretty strong sequential growth. Just wanted to outline what that was and show that a lot of the growth came from our core security across many different verticals, both divisions, and from getting customers who had signed up over the last quarter or so, revenue generating faster than we expected. Alex Henderson : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits : Hey, everybody. Good afternoon. One question on CDN and one question on Security. So, on the CDN side, we understand that it's an odd year, so traffic down, or traffic lower growth. And we also understand that you had some renewals on pricing. But you said you're taking share on a traffic basis. Cisco says about 29% IP traffic expected this year. You guys are flat. That's a pretty big delta. As you move into next year and you get past the price down on the big six, do you expect that that delta will narrow and will have less of a pricing impact and you'll have revenue growth closer to volume growth? Tom Leighton : Yeah. I don't know that you get traffic growth directly in line with revenue growth. And the reason for that is that you have staggered renewals throughout the year. I think, the way to think about the math is, if you look at taking a unit of delivery and a price per unit as prices decline, there's a certain amount -- depending on how you model it. You would need to get just to be flat. So, really the way to think about it is, as you go into 2020 or any year where you have line of sight to more traffic, the question becomes does that traffic accelerate at a rate that is greater than your expected price decline? So we will have the number of renewals next year like we always have. Some of our contracts too have volume discounts. As you push more traffic there can be lower unit rate. So rally the way you think about it, the question you need to think about here is, will we see enough traffic from these new OTT initiatives? Things like the Olympics, Presidential Election that will offset that price decline. The good news is we've gotten some of our larger customers repriced here. So that, again -- I think it's possible we're really just going to see how successful these launches are as they come to market. Ed McGowan : Also, and you reported the Cisco traffic stat, and in fact we're growing our traffic a lot faster than that. Michael Turits : Right. And then, on Security, one of the things that you showed, one of the booths at the conference was the launch, the product at the -- the roadmap for the launch of Secure Web Gateway. Can you give us an update on that? And how directly once that gets launched do you plan to go up against Zscaler? Tom Leighton : Yeah. So that's on track, Enterprise Threat Protector 3.0 with full suite capabilities later this year, and that will go up against Zscaler. And we already compete with Zscaler with not only Enterprise Threat Protector but Enterprise Application Access, and we are competing very successfully. Michael Turits : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Lee Krowl from B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open. Lee Krowl : Great. Thanks for sneaking me in, guys. I normally hate asking innings questions, but I think it's relevant just given how much progress you guys have made on the bundling front with some of your e-commerce and web customers. So, could you maybe talk about the inning, what innings we're in with being able to bundle the Security Solutions with CDN across the customer base? Tom Leighton : I'd say it's very relatively early days. We do talk a lot about protect and perform and in fact when you buy Kona Site Defender that comes with Dynamic Site Accelerator. Really just all works on the same Akamai platform. We're processing all the requests to provide the Security on KSD, and so just by the fact of we're processing where there is network, you're going to get faster delivery. And if you buy Bot Manager, that of course rides on top of Kona Site Defender. And so when you want these Security services, you get some basic delivery and acceleration with that. I think the bundling is very important. Gives us a real edge in the marketplace. It makes it really challenging for a web customer to want to go to another provider that not only will their -- service their applications slow down, but they won't have security. Also makes it challenging on that side of the house to split traffic because in fact we've had a couple large performance, customers want to try to use two vendors, and if you only have half your site secured, you're not secure at all. And then they come to the switch back to use Akamai because they need the security. And we're pretty unique out there in terms of having these dual capabilities. And the best part is, it's all one platform, all on one service. And so, there I would say, viewing us today, as I talked about before, we're not just a great CDN. We have that, but we're a market leader by far in terms of security. Lee Krowl : Got it. And then, just my second question. Last couple quarters, you've had a nice tailwind from the gaming vertical. In your prepared remarks, you kind of seem to fall off the growth drivers. So just kind of your thoughts on the gaming vertical specifically and maybe your expectations for the second half? Ed McGowan : Sure. So we had a very strong quarter in gaming in Q1 and came off a very strong year in 2018. Gaming can be somewhat seasonal, not necessarily based on the calendar, but based on when new games come to market. So Q2 was a lighter quarter in terms of gaming traffic for us, not because we lost any share, but with more just kind of a light -- lighter gaming quarter in general. Hard to predict when and how popular games will be, but again I don't think there's anything to be concerned as to where a lighter schedule. Lee Krowl : Got it. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Will Power from Baird. Your line is now open. Charles Erlikh : Great. Thanks guys for taking the question. This is actually Charlie Erlikh on for Will. I'll just ask one quick one. Could you talk a little bit about the growth split between the new and existing customers, maybe particularly how the new customer acquisition has gone since making some of these go-to-market improvements in the last year or two? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Sure. So still the majority of our business comes from our existing customer base. The sales organization does a great job of selling additional capabilities into that base. We have been very pleased and we've seen a consistent return on our new customer acquisition. We don't break it out specifically, but we have seen some pretty good traction. And as I mentioned earlier, we've been leading with securities, so a lot of those customers are coming on as security customers. Charles Erlikh : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rishi Jaluria from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Rishi Jaluria : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones. First wanted to start on live video the record I think you said with the concurrent viewership at India-New Zealand match is as painful is that memory might be really impressive. Just help me understand, what's driving some of this international traffic growth and maybe thinking from a financial perspective given that a lot of the viewership for these types of things might be in emerging markets, should we expect that to be a little bit of a drag on ARPU, or is that less sensitive from kind of a pricing perspective and then I've got a follow-up on the zero trust side. Ed McGowan : Sure. I'll take the last part of that question in terms of the size of the traffic. One of the things as you go into some of these emerging markets you mentioned cricket, there's been some forces in the market that have enabled much better quality video access to millions of users and that's a great trend for us. In terms of the price sensitivity, we've talked about before in the Media market, really it is a pretty efficient market around volumes. So we don't notice anything specific relative to emerging markets having lower prices because of our emerging markets or what not it really is a function of volume. And what's driving those volumes is you've got lots and lots of people consuming media, the teams have done a good job of gaining some customers in some of these countries outside the U.S. that are big traffic pushers you think about cricket not a big support here in the U.S. but very big internationally. We tend to go after whoever has rights for a live video. And like I said earlier we've got the best platform the best technology and capacity in the right places. So good business for us. Rishi Jaluria : Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just on the zero trust side, I mean I think we all get that it's a big opportunity. And clearly, the way the talk is going when it comes to security. Can you just maybe help us understand or remind us your kind of differentiation on the zero trust side just given that every single security vendor out there says they have something in zero trust? Thanks. Tom Leighton : Yes. It's started to become kind of a buzzword. So everybody says they got it even though they don't. With Akamai's solution, we do access at the application layer instead of the network layer. And that's a big differentiator because at the traditional approach of doing it at a network layer, once you're in, you pretty much can go everywhere. Now there's a lot of folks that will sell extra equipment to do network segmentation. But you still have the same challenge and then you get even more overhead. By doing it at the app layer, which we do as a service not -- we're not selling boxes like a typical approach then we can sit in between the device and the user and the application just the same way that we do for public facing applications. And we can bring Kona Site Defender to bear. So we authenticate it really is the user that they really have access to this particular application not just to the corporate Internet and then we make sure that they don't ever touch the enterprise application or data directly. Everything comes through us and we scrub it and we defend it. And that just isn't done today and nobody has that capability out there. We're unique in being able to do that because there is no real competitor to Kona Site Defender. Never mind bring it to bear to enterprise applications. And then you have our Edge platform with the massive scale which is really important for the large-scale attacks. And you have Bot Manager, which we can bring to bear to understand really what is it that entity that is coming to access the application. And also where is that entity going otherwise as we can catch for example HVAC systems that are exfiltrating sensitive corporate data because we're monitoring everything that the devices do inside an enterprise to make sure it's safe. So it really is a unique solution and very different than all the other folks that are talking zero trust. Rishi Jaluria : Great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Tom Barth : Operator, we are have time for one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Ken Talanian : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned getting guaranteed commitments as a way of offsetting the revenue decline. Just wondering if you could describe how that's trended over the past year what you're thinking about for the back half to the year? And then 2020 in particular around the forthcoming OTT launches? Ed McGowan : Yes. So we're not going to give specific guidance for 2020. But in terms of how it's going with the revenue commitments it varies by customer. What that does it enables us to one have more confidence in going out and building ahead of plan. You know customers vary from customer-to-customer in terms of how much they're willing to commit. Sometimes we get a percentage of traffic, sometimes its $1 commitment et cetera. But it's always something that we try to get as part of our sales when we can. Ken Talanian : Okay. And then just curious if you could highlight the primary drivers of the margin upside rank order those and what do you think might drive upside the back half? Ed McGowan : Yes. Sure. So you're talking about the margin upside for the quarter we just delivered correct? Ken Talanian : Correct. Ed McGowan : Yes. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks part of that is just our operating -- operational efficiency. And I talk a little bit about how we -- we're starting to see some good returns from our procurement function. We enhanced what we said some procurement function, but we really enhanced that and we're starting to see some fruits of our labor there. And just in general we're investing in efficiencies in IT for scaling our G&A operations and managing our headcount more effectively. That's we experience turnovers. Ken Talanian : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Tom Barth : Yeah, great. Thank you, Ken and thank you everyone for joining us this evening. In closing, we will be presenting at some Investor Conferences and events throughout the quarter. Details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Thank you for joining us and have a wonderful evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.",

A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks Tom. And thank you all for joining us today. Before I cover our financial results, I'd like to say a few words about the significance of this week in internet history. 50 years ago, on October 29, 1969, the first message was transmitted over the Internet. The first message was supposed to be a login, but after the letters L & O reached Stanford from UCL's UCLA, the internet crashed due to a memory overflow. It's stunning to think about how far the Internet has come from those humble beginnings. And I'm looking forward to joining the Internet's leading pioneers tomorrow at the Internet 50 Conference at UCLA, where we'll celebrate 50 years of amazing innovation. And I'll lead a discussion on the future of internet security and privacy. This week also marks the 20th anniversary of Akamai's IPO on October 29, 1999. Like the internet, Akamai has come a long way since our founding. During the first 10 years of our existence, we essentially created the CDN industry, where we're still the market leader by far. And over the last decade, we pioneered the creation of Edge security services with industry-leading products such as KONA SITE DEFENDER and Bot Manager. Our success over the past 20 years has been achieved through very hard work, tremendous innovation and the development of our unique Edge platform with servers in nearly 4,000 locations across 1,000 cities and 137 countries. The breadth of our Edge platform means that we're incredibly close to billions of end-users. And being so close means that Akamai is in a unique position to provide the near instant response times, very high quality video experiences and market leading security services that our customers are demanding. As many of you know, there's been a lot of buzz lately about the importance of being at the Edge. Gartner, Forrester, IDC and other leading analyst firms have all published reports explaining why the Edge is so important for end-user performance and security. This has not gone unnoticed by our competitions, who are now trying to play up any connection they can make to the Edge. No matter how slender even when their platforms are really located in core datacenters. They're now talking about how its computing can be used for tasks such as locating nearby resources, supporting AV testing or enabling real-time streaming. And they're talking about it in a way that suggests that these capabilities are somehow novel. Those of you who've been following Akamai for a while know that Akamai is the one company with a true Edge platform. And that we've been leading the way when it comes to Edge services for nearly two decades. In fact, we launched the world's first suite of Edge services 19 years ago in October of 2000. And 18 years ago, eWeek featured Akamai for its evolution into an ambitious provider of Edge computing to large businesses. To be clear, Edge computing is not new; at least it's not new for Akamai. We've had thousands of customers using our Edge computing capabilities for well over a decade. And not just for locating nearby resources, supporting AV testing or enabling real-time streaming. Akamai customers have long been using our Edge computing capabilities for a wide variety of tasks that are helpful in managing a state-of-the-art web presence. For example, tasks such as API governance, global traffic management and application load balancing, script management, user prioritization and waiting room, URL redirection and rewrites, phased code deployment, access control, field input validation, adaptive image and video optimization, proxy detection, watermarking, token authentication and revocation, content encryption, bot management, web app firewall and more recently IoT message broker and compute services, and blockchain ledger updates. All of these capabilities and more are enabled through our platforms highly distributed design which supports real-time data processing and decision making close to the end user. So that every user can have a great experience without overloading expensive cloud datacenters. To be clear, we don't take the competition lightly but when it comes to Edge abilities, we believe that the others have a lot of catching up to do to match what we've been doing and doing profitably for a very long time. Turning now to our financial results. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered another quarter of excellent results in Q3 coming in above expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue was $710 million, up 7% over last year in constant currency. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $1.10 per diluted share, up 18% in constant currency. Our very strong third quarter results were once again driven by the rapid growth of our cloud security and international businesses. Strong growth in video software and gaming download traffic. And our continued focus on operational excellence. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in Q3 was 42%, up one point over Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29%, up two points over Q3 of last year. We've made excellent progress towards our goal of achieving non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020. As we continue to invest in innovation on new products with the goal of driving our future growth. Our security portfolio continued to be the fastest growing part of our business in Q3 achieving revenue of $216 million, up 29% year-over-year in constant currency. Bot manager and our enterprise security solutions continue to lead the way in Q3 with revenue growing by more than 50% over Q3 of last year. In addition to selling our enterprise security services directly to major enterprises, we're also now equipping our carrier partners with services that they can sell to small and medium-sized businesses to defend against malware and bot attacks. By embedding our technology in the carrier products such as the recently released Comcast Business Security Edge, we can efficiently reach a much larger number of enterprise customers. The success of our security products was again a key driver for growth in our web division which delivered $390 million of revenue in Q3, up 10% over Q3 of last year in constant currency. Our leadership in security also helped to limit customer churn to a five-year low in Q3. Keeping customers happy is always job number one and so we were very pleased to see such a strong result. Our media and carrier division also performed well in the third quarter due to strong traffic growth for OTT video services and software and gaming downloads. Overall, we continue to grow traffic on our platform in Q3 faster than published growth rates for the Internet as a whole meaning that we continued to gain traffic share. We set a new record for peak traffic on October 15th when we delivered 106 terabits per second. This is 66% larger than the peak we saw in Q3 of last year and it's a strong proof point for the enormous capacity of the Akamai Edge platform. We believe that our ability to provide high quality performance at this scale gives us a strong competitive Edge when it comes to delivering traffic for popular OTT services. On a typical day, we now deliver over 800,000 terabytes of content end users. To put such a large number in context, 800,000 terabytes is about what is contained in 200 million DVDs or 800 billion web pages. And we are now delivering this much traffic almost every day on the Akamai Edge platform. Before handing the call over to Ed, I'd like to say a few words about three recent acquisitions. KryptCo, ChameleonX and Exceda. KryptCo is a very small MIT based startup with some excellent technology for providing truly secure multi-factor authentication or MFA. The technology is easy to use and has significant security advantages over traditional MFA solutions which can be compromised by phishing attacks. We plan to integrate this technology into our portfolio of enterprise security solutions. ChameleonX is a small Israeli startup with some innovative technology for detecting when a website contains or links to malware that causes end-user data to be compromised. Accidentally incorporating malware from third parties into a website or app is a major problem for enterprises that has already resulted in several large data breaches, which in turn can lead to very large financial penalties from regulators. Our goal in acquiring ChameleonX is to develop a service to stop these attacks. We expect the deal to close soon. Lastly Exceda is a leading provider of CDN and web security services in Latin America. They've been our largest reseller and an important and fast-growing region and they have a very talented salesforce and professional services team. We've entered into an agreement to acquire Exceda as part of our overall plan to grow our market presence throughout Latin America, including Brazil, Mexico Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Peru. We expect the acquisition to close later in Q4. These three transactions will cost less than $50 million combined. We view them as smart investments that we think will drive significant growth for Akamai in the future. In general, we plan to continue to be active in M&A which is a key reason why we raised an additional $1.15 billion in convertible debt in August. Of course, we're always judicious in how we spend shareholder capital as we continue to search for compelling opportunities to accelerate profitable revenue growth. In summary, we're very pleased with the consistency of our results in the first three quarters of 2019. The impressive revenue growth of our security products, the high traffic growth in our CDN business, our strong growth and opportunity in the international markets and our healthy operating margins achieved even as we continue to invest in innovation, new products and acquisition with the goal of driving our future growth. We're especially pleased to have delivered these results the right way. As evidenced by Akamai being named last quarter to both the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the Global FTSE4Good index. And for that, I want to thank our hard-working employees for helping Akamai to achieve such strong results and positive recognition. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed to review our Q3 results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. As Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter in Q3. We were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on revenue, operating margin and earnings. Q3 revenue was $710 million, up 6% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency, driven by strong security growth and higher than expected video and software traffic. In addition, we didn't see the traditional slowdown in traffic during the summer months as we have seen in the past. Revenue from our web division was $390 million, up 9% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency. Revenue growth for this group of customers continued to be driven by our security business, where we saw strong performance across multiple security products in several key verticals, including financial services, commerce and high-tech. Revenue from our media and carrier division was $320 million, up 2% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency. The better than expected growth in Q3 came from continued momentum in security and higher than expected OTT video and software traffic as we gain share in several key customers during the quarter. Revenue from the internet platform customers was $44 million, up 2% from the prior year. Security revenue for the third quarter was $216 million, up 28% year-over-year or 29% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets now represent 42% of total revenue in Q3, up four points from Q3, 2018 and up one point from Q2 levels. International revenue was $297 million, up 15% year-over-year or 18% in constant currency. As Tom outlined earlier, we entered into an agreement in Q3 to acquire Exceda as part of our overall plan to grow our market presence throughout Latin America. We are pleased with the traction we've seen from prior go-to-market investments overseas and expect the Exceda acquisition once closed will help spur revenue growth internationally. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact of $2 million on a sequential basis and negative $6 million on a year-over-year basis. Finally, revenue from our US market was $413 million relatively flat year-over-year. Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 78% roughly flat with Q2 two levels and up one point from the same period last year, primarily due to the continued execution of our platform efficiency initiatives. GAAP gross margin which includes both depreciation and stock based compensation was 65%, down one point from Q2 levels. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $250 million, down $4 million from Q2 levels and favorable to our guidance due to our continued focus on operational efficiencies, savings generated through our enhanced procurement function and the timing of approximately $2 million of costs related to our new headquarters shifting from Q3 to Q4. Now moving on to profitability, adjusted EBITDA was $301 million, up $8 million from Q2 levels and up $27 million or 10% from the same period in 2018. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 42% consistent with Q2, up one point from Q3, 2018 and above the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was $208 million, up $4 million from Q2 levels and up $27 million or 15% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, consistent with Q2 levels, up two points from Q3 of last year and above our guidance range. Capital expenditures in Q3 excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $154 million. This was below our guidance range due to lower than expected spend on our new headquarters, as well as some costs related to network build-out that shifted into Q4.  Before I move on to earnings, one quick housekeeping item. During Q3, we started to recognize our share of earnings from our previously announced blockchain joint venture with Mitsubishi. Our share of the JV's earnings is a loss of $1.4 million in Q3. It is reflected in our GAAP net income, but it is excluded from our non-GAAP results. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $138 million or $0.84 of earnings per diluted shares. Non-GAAP net income was $181 million or $1.10 of earnings per diluted share, up 17% year, up 18% in constant currency and $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $34 million based on a Q3 effective tax rate of 16%. This rate is approximately one point lower than our guidance due to higher percentage of foreign earnings. Now we'll discuss some balance sheet items. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet. As a September 30th, our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities totaled $2.3 billion, up about $ billion from the end of Q2. This increase was due to $1.15 billion convertible debt offering we closed in August. This brought our total debt at the end of Q3 to $2.3 billion. Now I'll review our use of capital. During the third quarter, we spent $176 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately two million shares. We added Q3 with approximately $800 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. As Tom mentioned earlier, we plan to remain active and discipline in pursuing additional M&A. In our most recent debt offering, further strengthens our balance sheet for additional strategic flexibility. We believe our discipline and balanced capital allocation approach will allow us to continue to drive shareholder value through investing organically in the business, pursuing M&A and continued share repurchases. In summary, we're very pleased with our Q3 results and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. I'd now like to provide Q4 guidance and an update to our 2019 guidance. As always, seasonality plays a large role in determining our financial performance for the fourth quarter, driven by seasonal online retail activity for our e-commerce customers, higher than normal traffic for our large media customers, and a higher proportion of carrier software license deals that tend to be signed in the fourth quarter. And finally, this year we'll see the launch of two highly publicized OTT offerings in Q4. All these factors make the fourth quarter the hardest to predict. We also expect the potential for further foreign currency exchange headwinds in Q4 from the continued strengthening of the US in a potential for additional currency volatility associated with Brexit. At the current spot rates, however, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have limited impact on Q4 compared to Q3 levels. But will have a negative impact of $2 million year-over-year. Taking all these factors into account, we are projecting Q4 revenue in the range of $735 million to $755 million, or up 3% to 6% in constant currency over Q4, 2018. To frame this guidance, if the online holiday season and media traffic demand including the OTT launches is exceptionally strong, we would expect to be near the higher end of the revenue range. If the online holiday season and media traffic demand is not as strong then we would expect to be towards the lower end of the range. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 78%. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $274 million to $278 million. The increase in costs over Q3 levels is due to higher sales incentive compensation costs that we typically see in Q4, two months of operating costs associated with the Exceda acquisition, additional marketing expenses related to our Europe and Asia customer conferences. And increase rent associated with the new headquarters building.  Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins in the range of 41% to 42%. Now moving to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $94 million to $96 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% to 29% for Q4. Moving on to CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $153 million to $165 million, excluding equity compensation in the fourth quarter. This includes approximately $22 million related to our new headquarters, as well as continued network investments in anticipation of increased OTT traffic in 2020. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.10 to $1.15 or 4% to 10% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $35 million to $37 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 16%. And it also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. Looking into the full year, we are raising both our revenue and EPS guidance. On the revenue side, we expect a range of $2.857 billion to $2.877 billion, which is an increase of approximately $12 million at the midpoint of the range compared to our previous guidance. To the full year, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA margins of 42%. We expect 2019 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 29%. We expect full year CapEx to be 21% of revenue and included in our 2019 CapEx spend is roughly $100 million of one time costs related to the moving into our new headquarters. Moving to EPS. We are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share range to $4.36 to $4.42 for full year 2019 which is up $0.11 at the midpoint compared to our previous guidance. Our guidance assumes non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16%, a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. In summary, we are very, very pleased with our business performance, as well as our ability to again increase our guidance for the full year. Thank You. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. MarkMahaney: Thanks. Two questions. Ed you talked about not seeing the typical slowdown into summer traffic that you have seen historically. Any thoughts on why that is? And then secondly a big-picture question on the streaming opportunity. I know you've got two OTT launches, just talk bigger picture. I think this is the one of the biggest trends we're seeing now in video, music and in gaming too. Just talk about how well leveraged you think Akamai is against the streaming opportunity? Any other examples you could provide other than the two launches that are expected in November. Thank you very much. EdMcGowan: Sure. So, Marcus this is Ed. Yes, the slowdown in traffic typically in years we don't have events whether it's an Olympics or a World Cup. We do tend to see traffic lighten up especially in Europe during the summer months, usually last couple of weeks of July going through August. And we just didn't see that this year and what was interesting is we did see relatively strong traffic in Europe and really across the board in all different parts of the business, OTT, we saw it in gaming. We saw it in software downloads as well. So it was encouraging not to see that slowdown and we had modeled in some of the slowdown we provided our guidance last quarter that explain some of the over performance. And then in terms of the streaming OTT launches, I get a couple questions in there how well leveraged are we. I think we're very well leveraged with the most publicized OTT offerings in the sense that we've got great customer relationships with the folks that are coming out with new services. We build out a lot of capacity over the last couple of quarters here that's why you are seeing our CapEx be higher than normal and that provides you a benefit when you're competing in a multi CDN world, having ample capacity and having capacity in the right areas. It's not just about having a total amount of capacity, but having capacity in the right operator networks, in the right cities, in the right locations around the world is critical. And also we talked about earlier; we had gone through a number of pricing renewals throughout the year with a lot of these folks. So we believe are well-positioned to capture our fair share. Now most of these players are multi CDN and in some cases some of them own their own CDNS, but again we think we're well positioned and are continuing to build out for what we hope will be significant traffic. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Weis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. KeithWeiss: Excellent. I was hoping to sneak in two questions. One on the cloud security side of the equation, where it seems like traffic growth continues to hold up really well. Some of those core components that we've been talking about for a while, including sort of bottleneck appear to be growing really well. I was hoping we could get an update on some of the newer acquired assets, some of the access stuff or Janrain which was acquired last year, just to get an update on that side of the equation. And then the second was on, I was hoping just for a reminder, if you could talk to us about how we should expect the balance between US growth and international growth to trend into 2020. I know the US had some headwinds this year around some pricing events and international has been remarkably strong growth throughout the entire year. Should we expect the US to sort of catch up the international, or is there always going to be some further weight on the US business versus international that we should keep in mind? TomLeighton: Yes, I'll take the first one, this is Tom. We're really excited about the security business, the flagship products there are Kona Site Defender, which provides the cloud-based web app firewall solution that keeps sites from being taken over or corrupted or data being stolen and Prolexic, which stops the denial of service attacks that come at the IP or the routing layer. And those are the flagship products we've built a ton of capabilities on top of that. You mentioned Bot Manager, which is just doing incredibly well. We talked about growth more than 50% year-over-year and Bot Manager stops the kinds of attacks where an adversary is trying to buy up all the inventory, it could be an article of clothing, could be tickets to a sports event, stops the price scrapers which can cause a lot of expense for the website, especially travel websites and maybe most importantly stops the accounts effort. And this is the bots that are checking out stolen our guests credentials against your bank account to see if they got the right one, then they can drain your bank account and we've had fabulous success in stopping those kinds of attacks and that's I think a key reason why it's - the revenue is growing so rapidly. And the best news there is, we got a long way to go just in our existing base and of course, also signing up new customers. You mentioned Janrain, the acquisition we did at the beginning of the year for their identity cloud capabilities, which we're integrating into our platform. I think one of the exciting use cases there is to help our customers manage user data, opt in requirements and to help them be compliant with the laws that are being passed all around the world. I think a lot of people are familiar with GDPR in Europe, especially now that's some multi-hundred million dollar fines have been issued. But you have a law coming into effect in California, CCPA on January 1. Most of our customers probably are not yet compliant. We can help with that. You'll have other states in the US; New York will be passing laws and many other countries around the world. And these laws are all a little bit different and our customers are going to need help making sure that they can be compliant. And I think we really could help using our identity cloud solution, which we're creating a part through the Janrain acquisition. We've talked about our enterprise security solutions, a notion of zero trust. I think there is a very exciting future there. We're seeing substantial customer wins there, as people start embracing the zero trust concept and methodology. Again, revenue is growing over 50% there as well. We talked about the new acquisitions. Edge integrity, which is the ChameleonX acquisition I think, is very important. This is where we stop things like Magecart that have caused some large data breaches on famous websites. In turn, again huge fines, multi-hundred million dollar fines being imposed when those breaches have happened, and I think Akamai is in a fantastic position to protect our customers against those kinds of attacks. People don't think about it a lot today, but most of the content you get, when you go to a website, doesn't really start or originate at that website. It's third-party content. Content used for marketing purposes, for performance management, advertising, all sorts of other things. And it turns out that content can often have malware in it or that a website will link to a partner who provides these services and they will be compromised with malware and that results in the end user giving up their private data like a credit card. And Akamai is in a really good position to stop that and we'll be looking forward to introducing a product into the market next year, early next year, which we call page integrity management. We talked about KryptCo, another small acquisition, but with some really exciting technology around push-based multi-factor authentication. And the interesting thing there is what a lot of enterprises use for that today is vulnerable to phishing attacks. And that people don't think about it a lot, but that's not very good and with the integration of KryptCo, we're going to be able to stop those attacks for enterprise. So there's a lot of exciting innovation going on in cloud security at Akamai. And we're looking forward to continued strong growth there. And Ed, I'll turn it over to you for the other question. EdMcGowan: Sure. Keith, your question was around US versus international growth. So let me tackle it this way. Let me just remind everybody on the US side, we have flat year-over-year and then a bit challenge for us - and just as a reminder, that's where we have our Janrain accounts, those were down a couple of million quarter-over-quarter this quarter. And we also have the US commerce vertical in the US number of bankruptcies this year, including a couple this quarters. So still a challenged area. And then also a lot of the repricings for consolidations that we talked about earlier - in earlier quarters or in that area. But I think the question would be, how - what do you have to believe to see growth accelerate in the US and I think the three main categories. The first one is what Mark mentioned earlier on his first question around OTT growth, but just traffic in general where we're seeing strong traffic in not only just streaming video, but also music, OTT social et cetera, gaming. Then also Janrain, Janrain is a new addition, as Tom talked about, don't have a ton of penetration yet in the US, that's a new security product and then security in general when you look at enterprise, which is really in the early days and also new customer acquisitions. We've done a pretty nice job in the last couple of quarters of increasing our new customer acquisition in most of that's being led by security. So those would be the things you have to believe in order to start to see the US growth rate increasing as we go into the future. And as far as the international growth, that's been very strong as you pointed out, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that we made some significant investments in GTM, go-to-market over the last couple of years and we're starting to see that pay off. Very strong growth in Asia across all of our products, including media. Our web products as well as security seen very solid growth in EMEA. And then also Latin America and Middle East, we see a big opportunity to continue our growth as evidenced by our Exceda acquisition. Operator : Our next question comes from Will Power of Baird. Your line is open. WillPower: Okay. Great. Thanks. Yes, no, great to get to hear the commentary on the expected traffic in Q3 opportunities and Q4. I guess maybe just kind of following up, just to kind of thinking about the media and carrier division, the revenue growth opportunity. We did see the overall media revenue growth decelerate a bit year-over-year, I think up 2% or 3% constant currency. It sounds like, and maybe I'd love to get a little more color on this, how much of that is tied to the pricing renewals? What you're seeing on that front given the positive traffic commentary? Then how do we think about that into Q4? I mean is that - can you start to inflect or are you still going to have pricing renewal pressure? How do we think about that media revenue growth trajectory as we go into Q4 and then into 2020? EdMcGowan: Yes, good question, Will. I'd say there are two factors when you look at kind of the year-over-year. One is we had a really strong year in media last year. So a little bit tougher comps, but really pricing is the main driver. We've called it out for the last several quarters; it was a number of very large renewals that we went through for consolidations that we hadn't seen of this magnitude in the industry. So that was something that definitely was making the growth cost much harder. In terms of pricing renewals going into Q4, we factored everything into our guidance. I think if you look at the OTT launches, we factored in some growth associated with that, given that there in November, there's just not a ton of time left in the quarter. So not a huge expectation there and then with our giant customers, we had talked in the earlier quarter about the fact that we had a couple of renewals this quarter and were expected to be down $3 million or $4 million. We actually were only down about $2 million. So it's a little bit better there. And we expect that to be up a couple million next quarters. WillPower: Okay. If I could maybe just squeeze one more and Tom, you gave a lot of great examples of some of the things you're doing on the Edge today. As you look forward, what are some of the Edge applications that get you most excited? Maybe - is there anything tied to 5G as an example and what better positions you for those applications versus some of your competitors perhaps? TomLeighton: Yes. Pretty much everything - all of - everything we're doing involves Edge computing in some way. Certainly everything we're doing involves the Edge. And the Edge enhances pretty much everything that we're doing. As we look toward 5G, I think that's really exciting in terms of enabling new kinds of applications around the Internet of Things. There's been a lot of buzz about IoT, but so far, we haven't seen so many killer applications. But I think that could be in the process of changing. As we look across our customer base, I would say a lot of our customers in several different verticals are now engaged in projects involving IoT. Sensors in sneakers, sensors in clothing or sports equipment, sensors on price tags, obviously cars, obviously mobile devices and gaming, big IoT potential markets and the reason I think 5G is helpful here is because it will allow many billions more of devices to connect. The latency will be much lower across the air than it is for 3G and 4G and the throughput will be higher. So that means you get more devices can communicate more effectively and that's enabling I think for some of these at the same time people are coming up with these IoT applications and I think that could be very exciting. Now one of the nice things about 5G is that I think it makes it even more important that you have a real Edge network and not an Edge platform in name only, which we hear a lot from our competition. But a platform where you're really close to the last mile, you are deep inside, the carriers and the cellular networks that are offering this capability and Akamai is really unique in that context. And once the latency is lower in the last mile, and you have higher throughput, now, you really can take advantage of applications with low latency and high throughput, if you really have an Edge platform and because there you have the capacity in the last mile and you're close to what you have low latency. If you're trying to serve out of the core datacenters, you're still going to have latency problems even when 5G comes. And you're still going to have throughput problems even when you get better throughput in the last mile, and I think that's a key reason why you see Akamai being so much more successful in such a larger scale than some of these other companies that are serving out of core datacenters at, of course, much lower volumes, and it's the Edge platform that makes a difference and that is our competitive - a major competitive advantage. It really is the Edge; it's not just the marketing tool. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Your line is open. SterlingAuty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. One question, one follow-up. So on the OTT, before we even get to these two - couple of major launches, can you just set the context and give us an idea how big has OTT gotten within Media and Carrier or however you want to describe it? We've gotten to the point that it's material even before these big launches? EdMcGowan: Okay, Sterling. This is Ed. Yes, so we've always talked about how video is our largest source of traffic and it's our fastest growing source of traffic. So OTT is a pretty big part of the Media and Carrier business today. We do a ton with live sports; part of the strength we saw in Europe was as a result of folks that have sports rights. I didn't see any slowdown there and see the audience sizes growing. We do several live television offerings, linear television as well as a lot of video on demand. So it's been a very strong part of our business and continuing to grow. We're seeing some pretty good signs in terms of user adoption, bit rates increasing and traffic growing. SterlingAuty: All right. Great. And then one follow-up would be, I can't remember if you touched on in your prepared remarks, but just the web performance has been in area that has kind of weighed on the Company, but if I try to take a stab at what the security portion is and back that out, it looks like the web performance side is starting to stabilize. Is there any additional color you can give to - is that really the case and what's driving maybe a little bit of improvement there? EdMcGowan: Yes, I said there are the two things in the web performance business that is driving the performance that you're seeing. One is obviously security that you're right to point out that's been the primary driver, but also we're seeing really strong growth internationally both in Europe and Asia. So US have really been at the problem for us in terms of the US commerce verticals. So we're not ready to declare victory there yet, there is still some room to go there. And as I had mentioned, it was a couple of bankruptcies this quarter, has been probably over 10 so far this year. So still a troubled vertical for us. So until that really stabilizes I think it's tough to say that we're completely out of the woods on that part of the business, but again, we're seeing really strong security and web performance in Europe and Asia has been pretty strong for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is open. MichaelTurits: Hey, guys. Good evening. Tom, I wanted to ask you about another security that you didn't mention. I think that you talked about launching a secure web gateway at your conference this summer. So does that put you into competition with some of the other network security providers that are looking to do security from the Internet like Zscaler or Palo Alto, and how are you going about that? TomLeighton: Yes. Secure web gateway is an important component in our Enterprise Threat Protector solution. And yes, we are in competition with, I would say the largest competitors or the traditional ways of doing things where you have a secure web gateway, that's a piece of hardware that you operate in a datacenter or there is a cloud instance of it and you operate it there. The legacy way of doing things are the traditional way of doing things as our largest competitor. Zscaler would be our largest competitor; I think in the future way of doing things. And we do compete actively with Zscaler both for Enterprise Threat Protection, which includes a secure web gateway and also Enterprise Application Access which is where you're providing the access or authenticating enterprise employees and devices to get them access and we compete very successfully. Big advantages that Akamai has are our enterprise platform. We have a much larger cloud security business overall. And so we're already engaged and trusted by the CSOs in the large enterprise organizations. We have our Kona Site Defender service, which I think is critical for really providing enterprise security and zero trust and the competition that you mentioned doesn't have anything like that. And I would say, lastly performance matters for enterprises. And one of the big challenges with enterprise security that often keeps them from using products from some of the companies you mentioned is that when you turn it on, including our secure web gateway, it destroys your performance to the point where the employees objecting, especially if you are a global company and you don't want to use it. And of course that's a problem. With Akamai being a performance company, when you turn on our security products, your performance gets better. In fact, we recently had some major customer wins where performance was identified the customers a reason that they chose us over the competition. So they get great Akamai security, but now their enterprise apps get faster for employees instead of slower. So yes, we're competing against those companies and I think, successfully. MichaelTurits: Okay and then just Ed, if you - how far we in terms of having built out the capacity we need for those launches and into 2020, and obviously, you haven't given guidance yet, but are we at the point where next year we can start to get back to the long-term range for CapEx, both, on a network basis and also whether or not there's any HQ left over? EdMcGowan: Yes, so just on the HQ, we'll be moving into our HQ later this week. So there won't be anything material related to the HQ from a CapEx perspective next year because we don't anticipate anything. And then on the build-out, we've been building out in advance as we've talked about and I think really what it is going to depend on is, how much demand do we see. To the extent that we see significant demand, we may build a little bit more in the first half of the year to be prepared for that. But we have made pretty significant investments, now we'd expect us to be giving guidance, but toward the higher end of our long-term range for CapEx here for the next several quarters. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. BradZelnick: Thank you so much and congrats on a nice quarter, particularly in security. I wanted to follow up on one of Michael Turits' question as it relates to enterprise security and specifically competing with the likes of a Zscaler or a Palo Alto, which by the way, both of those companies, their go-to-market slightly differs from one another. And I wanted to ask more about your routes to market for enterprise security and appreciating you've spoken a bit to this in the past, you've got strong carrier relationships more broadly across Akamai, and you've got the traditional security VAR channel. Can you talk a little bit about how the go-to-market strategy is evolving as you continue to pick up steam in enterprise security? TomLeighton: Yes, sure. Usually with new products, especially if they are new to the industry in, which they often are with Akamai, will go direct first through betas and really get the product development of established market traction. And then it quickly extends to our channel. In the area of enterprise security, there I think we have even greater channel adoption and potential. I talked earlier about Comcast business' new security Edge product. You may see it advertised on TV, that's Akamai underneath and it provides a version of our Enterprise Threat Protector product that we talked about just a minute ago for small and medium businesses that Comcast business sells to small and medium businesses. So I think you'll see us on the enterprise security side make even greater use of the channel than we already do with all of our other products and in many cases, you'll see our products be white labeled, so you wouldn't initially know it's Akamai, but it's Akamai underneath. BradZelnick: Thanks, Tom. And if I could just follow up, particularly on M&A, it's nice to see not only the innovation, you've been able to acquire, but it sounds like very efficient use of capital. As we look forward, how should we contemplate the possibility of Akamai making a larger acquisition in security? Now you've got a lot of cash on hand and what directions might you look to build out the portfolio or rather than sharing your blueprints with us, are there any - is there anywhere sacred where you absolutely wouldn't go? Thank you. EdMcGowan: Yes, obviously, we're going to be very judicious with anything that's a larger acquisition. It's not impossible we do something larger. In the area of security, valuations are pretty high today and you're not going to see us do anything wacky in terms of the financials. We're very happy with our own capabilities where we see good technology that makes sense financially. We're going to buy it. And then we're going to develop it and bring it to market and now with a security business that's at our scale, we're in a really good position to do that. In terms of direction, I think you'll see us continue to work in them all that we've been working in, things that are a natural adjacencies for us that complement our portfolio, that work - that really benefit well from having a true Edge platform that will be synergistic with our customer base. Now that we're in enterprise security, I think that now extends to most major enterprises. Those are the areas where we'd be looking for. Obviously, we care a lot about security and that's broadly construed everything from protecting websites, for protecting applications, protecting datacenters, protecting identity, user information, now protecting enterprises. So I think building out in that area is obviously of interest and as you saw, we are purchasing Exceda, which is a leader in a different geography where we want to see a lot more growth in our traditional businesses, content delivery and to some extent web security. So I think what you've seen us do is a good blueprint for what's coming. There will be acquisitions that will fit well and benefit from the Akamai Edge platform and they'll be synergistic. They're not going to be nutty in terms of cost for things given some of the valuations out there. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Lee Krawl of B. Riley FBR. Your line is open. LeeKrawl: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Two quick questions. First, could you maybe provide us a little more commentary around the churn statements you kind of made in the prepared remarks? Curious if that's a function of bundling, or maybe just better customer retention from a customer service standpoint. And then secondly, perhaps could you maybe quantify both the revenue and OpEx associated with the three acquisitions you did in the quarter, maybe in Q3, and perhaps more on annual run rate beyond Q4. Thanks. TomLeighton: Yes, I think the record low churn over the past five years, there's a lot of factors to that. It's the combination of products, which make a big difference to customers, to get performance and security in a single platform, in a single offer that matters. It's the great quality that we provide both in terms of enhancing the performance of an application and the security that really works. So the services are really strong and much better, than you can get anywhere else on the market, and the great people, with our services and support. And we find, especially in the area of security with the attack vectors changing so rapidly that our customers, which are major enterprises, they want to have an expert that they can talk to, that they trust in and can be engaged with them to make sure they stay ahead of the attacks because the attack environment is changing so rapidly out there and so our services professionals are highly desired by our enterprise customers. I think all those things put together have helped reduce what was already a very low churn rate. So it was slow to start with. It's not a situation where we had any kind of churn problem; it's always been low single digits, and now even better. And Ed, do you want to talk about the revenue and the acquisitions? EdMcGowan: Yes, sure. So the ChameleonX and KryptCo acquisitions are immaterial. We're actually going to absorb the headcount into our normal hiring plan. So no real impact on OpEx. As far as revenue goes, we'll be integrating those into our products. So don't expect any material revenue here certainly in Q4 and in 2020. As far as Exceda goes, we talked about Q4 being about $2 million of revenue and about $0.01 dilutive as we go through the integration and then what we've talked about in our press release we issued when we announced the deal about $15 million of revenue for 2020, actually about $0.01 or $0.02 accretive to next year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open. AlexHenderson: Great. Thank you very much. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about two things. One, the sequential increase in OpEx is a little steeper. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of the waterfall, what's embedded in that than what we've modeled. And then the second one is on the international side, obviously, you're getting some benefit from the web 2.0 growth internationally versus a decline domestically. But can you talk about the split between domestic growths in security versus international, is international security growing faster than domestic and how do you see that playing out over the next year? And then one last thing, if I could throw it in, isn't 2020 going to be a much stronger year given with election year, Olympics year and all that sort of stuff. Could you talk little bit about how you're feeling about 2020 versus 2019 at the full year? Thanks. EdMcGowan: Sure, I'll take it - I'll take that those. So first, I'll start with the sequential increase in OpEx. I talked in my prepared remarks that there are a number of things that factor into it. First thing is, historically in Q4, we tend to see a pretty big jump in our sales incentive compensation plans related to folks hitting accelerators. In this year we're having a good year. So we're anticipating a number of folks tripping into accelerators. The other thing I talked about a couple of million dollars of OpEx is related to our building that pushed from Q3 to Q4. And then there is also the rent expense with the new building. So we're moving - and I mentioned, we'd be moving at the end of this week. So we have additional rent costs that go into the building as well. Those are the main drivers in terms of the sequential uptick in operating expenses. And also we have our customer conference for Europe and Asia. We had our US conference earlier on in the year. In terms of the international versus the US growth rates, we don't break those out, but it's safe to say that both of those are very strong and pretty similar, probably a little bit faster in the international, especially in Asia. And then your question on 2020 being a stronger year. We've talked about on some of our earlier calls as we think about 2020. 2020 is an even year and in even years we do tend to have more events. Next year, we have the Olympics, as well as the presidential election. And if I looked back to 2016, the last election we did see a nice uptick in traffic and typically with events like the Olympics that tend to go over several weeks, we do get some additional revenue. Usually there, you're signing up a number of rights holders across the world. So it does tend to be a decent event, nothing overly material, but a decent event that adds to the growth rates and then as we've talked about, obviously there is a couple of OTT launches coming here in the next month, as well as a few that are rumored to be coming in early 2020 and those will help our growth rate in 2020 as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from James Fish of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. JamesFish: Hey, guys. Great quarter. And thanks for squeezing me in here. Just quickly, last quarter you guys actually gave us greater clarity in the security business around customers across kind of the three main solutions of WAF, DDoS and Bot Management. Any chance if you can update on those customer counts again and also what percentage of customers have one or more security solutions versus kind of stand-alone? And if I can sneak in one more, it doesn't seem like you guys have many customers actually that are using both WAF and DDoS, can you maybe go into why that is? TomLeighton: Yes, we didn't give the exact counts last quarter. Just wanted to give some kind of idea. We'll probably do that on an annual basis, give you updates there, but probably not every quarter. We are seeing fantastic growth in security and we gave some of the highlights on this call. Penetration, I think we have a lot of room for growth in the existing base because there's several different security capabilities, and I think right now over half the customers have at least one, but our preferred model would be to have several of the security products into all the accounts. So plenty of room for growth in the existing base. I can also add that we're seeing very strong growth of new customers and that's being led by security. And then I think the third question was customers with Prolexic and Kona maybe. Now Kona Site Defender also provides style of service capabilities at the application layer. Prolexic is sort of specialized and it does denial of service at the routing or IP layer and that really is for protecting datacenters that have other things going on besides the website. If you just have a website, just have web traffic, then you wouldn't need Prolexic you would simply be using Kona Site Defender and all the capabilities built on top of that. And so that may be why you're looking at a smaller dual penetration. There are sort of different situations that you use them in. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. JeffvanRhee: Great. Just two quick clean-ups for me then. I think you had commented on the network build and some of the CapEx that pushed to Q4. Just curious if that was in response to some variability in terms of demand forecast, maybe an OTT or from others that drove the push. And then the second, for me, I think last quarter you commented on CDN and cloud security and such CDN is flattish and cloud security, I think you bumped to mid to high-20s versus prior being mid-20s. Just comfortable if those are both the right way to think about that? EdMcGowan: Sure, I'll take this one. On the network build side, it really wasn't a reflection of demand. It's really just the timing of the CapEx in terms of when it actually rides and we reported the CapEx. So nothing there from a demand perspective literally, just timing issue. And then on the CDN being flattish for the year and in the guide on security obviously had a good quarter here and securities, probably closer to the high-20s for security for the year and still flattish on the CDN side. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Co. Your line is open. JohnBlackledge: Great. This is John on for Colby. Thanks for sneaking me in. Just a follow-up on M&A. How should we be thinking about the level of M&A you could do next year and still be able to achieve 30% operating margin target? Thank you. TomLeighton: Yes. We're committed to doing 30% next year and I don't see anything at this point that would change that. And we're very conscious of operating margins; we make acquisitions and of course as you are seeing we're continuing to make acquisitions. So it's not that we're not going to move forward on deals that we think make a lot of sense that can help our customers, but we're planning to meet 30% operating margins next year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. TimHoran: Thanks. You're basically already at your margin kind of goals here. Do you think given the shift in business to security, and other products that margins can kind of continue to trend up for a couple of years? TomLeighton: We're not making guidance for margins past 2020. As I mentioned, we're committed to delivering 30% next year, and when we get to the beginning of next year, we'll see what we're thinking about in terms of the future. But we're also heavily focused on revenue growth. I think 30% is a good place for the Company to operate. If we can do better, we're certainly going to do that. And I think you on a good point that as security grows as a fraction of our overall revenue that is very helpful for us because that's a very high margin business. Now of course, at the same time as we make acquisitions and increase our investment for building innovative new security products, that adds a lot of R&D OpEx. So that you have the tension there and right now, we're planning to operate at 30% and if we change that for the future, we'll certainly let you know. TimHoran: No, that's right. I mean - do you think we've seen at last year a secular shift in seasonality here, given that the base is so much larger or what do you think caused at this summer? And have you seen that in the last couple of years? TomLeighton: Yes, so as I talked about earlier, Tim, this was kind of an unusual year in terms of what we saw for traffic. Hopefully, that's a trend that continues. Always Q4 is always the biggest seasonal quarter. We talk a lot of, I think most people think about the online shopping season and that is a factor for us. But also we - over the last few years, have seen a really big uptick in seasonality related to media. Some of it has to do with lots of new devices coming online and a lot of firmware updates, as well as sometimes, you'll see some video packages that are bundled in with various hardware platforms and things like that.  Also you tend to see in the fourth quarter, a lot of the gaming publishers try to get new game launches out. So I think we'll always have seasonality in the business as far as Q3 goes. I would be expecting as I think about a normal Q3 without events that would be your seasonally slower quarter and Q4 is always going to be your biggest quarter for traffic. End of Q& A Operator : And I'll turn the call back over to management. Tom Leighton : Okay. Well. Great. Well thank you everyone for joining us this evening. In closing, we'll be presenting at several investor conferences and events throughout the fourth quarter in both the US and Europe. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Thank you for joining us and have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tom Barth : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining Akamai's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to material differently from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 11, 2020. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.  As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the Financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me please turn the call over to Tom. Thomson Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $772 million, up 8% over Q4 in 2018 and up 9% in constant currency. This very strong result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security business, a better-than-expected holiday commerce season and substantial increases in traffic for our media customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 29%, up 1 point over Q4 in 2018. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1.23 per diluted share, up 15% year-over-year and up 16% in constant currency. These excellent results were due to our strong revenue growth, the benefit from cost reductions made over the past year and a lower tax rate.  For the full year, we exceeded our projections on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue was $2.89 billion, up 8% over the prior year in constant currency. We're especially pleased to report that we expanded non-GAAP operating margin to 29% in 2019, up substantially from 24% in 2017 and putting us very close to our target of 30% operating margin in 2020. Non-GAAP EPS for 2019 was $4.49, up $0.87 or 24% over 2018. We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations last year.  In Q4, our Security portfolio continued to be the fastest-growing part of our business, with revenue of $238 million, up a very strong 29% year-over-year in constant currency. Security revenue for the year was $849 million and represented 29% of our total revenue in 2019. We believe that our Security business is poised to make Akamai one of the very few publicly traded companies that generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue from cybersecurity solutions. In 2019, over 1,500 enterprises relied on our market-leading Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager solutions to defend against more than 46 billion malicious log-in attempts and 6 billion web application attacks, an increase of 150% over 2018. Both these services continue to be recognized as best-in-class by the leading analyst firms.  For example, last quarter, and for the second year in a row, Akamai was named as a leader in Gartner's report on critical capabilities for cloud web application firewall services and we received the highest scores in 2 key use cases. Just last month, Forrester named Akamai as a leader in its New Wave Bot Management competitive vendor evaluation. They said, Akamai leads the pack with robust attack response and reporting capabilities, and they called us the best fit for companies looking to thwart bots at the edge. That's important because we believe that the edge is the only place where you can successfully defend against large-scale bot attacks.  Last quarter, Forrester also elevated Akamai to the leaders category in its Zero Trust eXtended platform wave, awarding us the highest possible scores in 5 areas, including workforce security, zero trust vision and strategy. I'm especially excited about our continued innovation in cybersecurity, which has resulted in the development of several new products that will leverage the strength of our edge platform and that we believe can drive continuing growth going forward. These new products include Secure Web Gateway, Identity Cloud, Enterprise Defender, Multi-Factor Authentication and Page Integrity Manager. Page Integrity Manager addresses a new and rapidly growing attack that most organizations have no visibility into or defenses for, leaving them exposed to data breaches and regulatory actions. The challenge is that most of the content on a typical website or app today comes from third-party software or scripts for things like ads, analytics, social media and so on. The problem with third-party content is that it's hard to keep track of and to make sure that it's safe. And increasingly, it's not safe. That's because attackers have figured out that they don't have to steal personal information directly from the website. Instead, they steal it from end users by using malware that they've inserted into the third-party content.  Akamai Page Integrity Manager is designed to protect our customers' users from malware, no matter where it comes from, and also to alert our customers when we find malware on their site or on sites that they link to. Initial customer interest in this new service has been very high, and we're looking forward to exiting beta and selling this product more widely later in the year.  Our Media and Carrier Division also performed well in the fourth quarter due to strong demand for OTT video services and software and gaming downloads. In Q4, we continued to grow traffic on our platform much faster than published growth rates for the Internet as a whole, meaning that we continue to gain traffic share. And on December 3, we set an incredible record for peak traffic in 2019 of 121 terabits per second, demonstrating the enormous and unmatched scale of the Akamai Edge platform.  This record didn't last long though, as we've already delivered more traffic on multiple occasions during the first 5 weeks of 2020. In fact, I checked our traffic stats just a few minutes ago, and it looks like we're currently delivering about 140 terabits per second from the Akamai Edge platform.  It's important to note that these traffic levels are not like the theoretical capacity that some competitors in the marketplace claim. Our numbers measure the actual traffic that we deliver on behalf of our customers. It's also important to realize that the only way to really get anywhere close to Akamai's scale is by having a true edge platform. That's because you need to be very close to end users in order to gain access to the last-mile bandwidth necessary to deliver large amounts of traffic with great performance. If you try to deliver content from the data centers at the core of the Internet, you run into problems with performance and scale as the traffic gets clogged at Internet peering points before it reaches the last mile.  Delivering from the core is also more costly since you need to use expensive transit to reach end users. This is one reason why Akamai is so much more profitable than the competition. Of course, all the growing interest in the edge has led many vendors to play up any connection they can make to the edge, no matter how tenuous. But we believe that if you look carefully, you'll see that the others have a ton of catching up to do to match what Akamai has been doing at the edge and doing profitably for a very long time. We're excited by the opportunities in front of us as the OTT marketplace continues to develop, and we believe that our unmatched global capacity positions Akamai very well for 2020 and beyond.  Overall, we're very pleased with our performance last year. We grew revenue and continued to expand our margins. We grew non-GAAP EPS by 24%. We developed innovative new technology that we believe will help drive future revenue growth, and we delivered excellent value to our customers. I want to thank all of Akamai's customers and especially our talented employees for helping us to deliver such great results in 2019.  As we enter a new decade, I'm very pleased to see Akamai so well positioned for future growth. As you'll soon hear from Ed, we expect to surpass $3 billion in revenue in 2020, with over $1 billion of that total coming from our Security business. We also expect to achieve non-GAAP operating margin of 30%, and our non-GAAP EPS is projected to approach $5 per share. These are exciting new thresholds for Akamai, and I'll now turn the call over to Ed to provide further details. Ed? Edward McGowan : Thank you, Tom. As Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another great quarter in Q4. We exceeded the high end of our guidance range on revenue and earnings. Q4 revenue was $772 million, up 8% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency, driven by continued strong security growth and higher-than-expected holiday traffic in our media and commerce verticals.  As I mentioned on our last call, holiday seasonality from e-commerce and traffic from our large media customers could play a large role in our Q4 performance, and it did. Revenue from our Web Division was $420 million, up 9% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency. Revenue growth from this group of customers was again driven by our Security business as well as higher-than-expected holiday e-commerce traffic.  Revenue from our Media and Carrier Division was $353 million, up 8% year-over-year and 8% in constant currency. The better-than-expected growth in Media came mainly from strong OTT video traffic. Revenue from our Internet platform customers was $52 million, up 20% from the prior year. It is worth noting that Q4 benefited from approximately $6 million of event-specific revenue that we do not expect to reoccur in Q1. Security revenue across the company continued to be very strong, and for the fourth quarter, was $238 million, up 29% year-over-year and 29% in constant currency.  Moving on to revenue by geography, international revenue was $326 million in the fourth quarter, up 17% year-over-year or 18% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had very little impact on revenue on a sequential basis, but had a negative impact of $3 million on a year-over-year basis. Sales in our international markets represented 42% of total revenue, up 3 points from Q4 2018 and consistent with Q3 levels. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $446 million, up 3% year-over-year.  Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 78%, roughly flat with Q3 levels but down 1 point from the same period last year. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, up 2 points from Q3 levels. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $285 million, up from Q3 levels and slightly higher than our guidance due primarily to higher commissions and employee bonus expense.  Now moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $319 million, up $18 million from Q3 and up 6% from the same period in 2018. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 41%, in line with our guidance but down 1 point from Q3 and down 1 point from Q4 in 2018.  Non-GAAP operating income was $222 million, up $14 million from Q3 levels and up $21 million or 10% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, consistent with Q3 levels and up 1 point from Q4 last year. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $173 million. This was higher than our guidance range due to increased network investment in anticipation of continued demand from our OTT and gaming customers. Moving on to earnings. It is worth noting that our Q4 GAAP results include a $10 million restructuring charge, and we expect to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $4 million to $7 million in Q1 of 2020. These charges are primarily related to reductions of approximately 1% of our global workforce. It is important to note, these restructuring actions are being taken to enable some rebalancing of our investments, de-investing in some areas and investing in others and to position the company to meet our long-term goals of continued growth and scale. Also included in our restructuring charges are some small capitalized software impairments related to projects we no longer feel provide adequate return on our investment. Therefore, GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $119 million or $0.73 of earnings per diluted share.  Non-GAAP net income was $202 million or $1.23 of earnings per diluted share, up 15% year-over-year, up 16% in constant currency and $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. This outperformance was driven by higher-than-expected revenue and a lower non-GAAP effective tax rate due to higher-than-expected foreign earnings. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $30 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 13%.  Now I will discuss some balance sheet items. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet. As of December 31, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.4 billion. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $2.3 billion, unchanged from the end of Q3.  Now I will review our use of capital. During the fourth quarter, we spent $43 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 500,000 shares. We have approximately $765 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Our plan for 2020 is to continue to leverage our share buyback program to fully offset dilution resulting from equity compensation.  As we said in prior quarters, we plan to remain active but disciplined in pursuing additional M&A, and we believe that our strong balance sheet provides us with strategic flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. We also believe our capital allocation approach will allow us to continue to drive shareholder value through investing organically in the business, pursuing M&A and continued share repurchases. In summary, we are very pleased with our Q4 and 2019 results, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans in 2020 and for the long term. I'd now like to provide guidance for full year 2020 as well as for the first quarter. Looking ahead to the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $3.055 billion to $3.105 billion, with over $1 billion of that coming from our Security business.  We expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 43%, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 30%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.80 to $4.95. This represents year-over-year growth of 7% to 10% and 9% to 12% on a constant currency basis. This non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 15.5% to 16.5% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares.  Moving on to CapEx. Full year CapEx is expected to be 18% to 20% of revenue. We again expect full year CapEx to be higher than normal due to the continued investment in our network capacity.  Before I move on to Q1 guidance, I thought it would be helpful to talk about how we see the year unfolding. Now I will highlight some key items that you may want to think about as you build your models. In the first quarter, we typically see revenue step down sequentially as Q4 is our strongest seasonal quarter. Q4 2019 was a notably strong seasonal quarter. It also included some onetime event revenue, which I mentioned earlier.  On the expense side, remember that Q1, our employee payroll taxes and 401(k) matching expense reset, costs that will decline throughout the year. In addition, we won't see the full benefit of the restructuring efforts mentioned earlier until Q2. So we expect operating margins to be at the lowest level in Q1 and improved throughout the year.  As we look to Q2 and beyond, there are a few other factors to take into account. In addition to more global expansion of existing OTT offerings that have been announced for later this year, we are aware of several new direct-to-consumer OTT launches planned for late spring and early summer. 2020 also includes a summer Olympics in Q3 as well as the U.S. presidential election cycle, which typically drives elevated traffic levels in Q3 and Q4. Finally, we expect Q4 to once again be our strongest seasonal quarter.  So with that as a guide, I will provide specific Q1 guidance. We are projecting Q1 revenue in the range of $741 million to $755 million or up 6% to 8% in constant currency over Q1 2019. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $1 million impact on Q1 revenue compared to Q4 levels and having negative $5 million impact on a year-over-year basis. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77%.  Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $258 million to $262 million. The decrease in cost over Q4 levels is due mostly to lower incentive compensation-related expenses. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of approximately 42%. Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $97 million to $99 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% for Q1.  Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $139 million to $149 million, excluding equity compensation in the first quarter. This reflects the continued network investments I mentioned previously. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.13 to $1.18 or up 5% to 9% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of approximately $35 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 16%. And it also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares.  In summary, we are very pleased with our business performance and with our positioning as we look forward to 2020. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : So looking at the strength in international revenue growth, is it fair to look at the OTT launches as relying on Akamai more for international distribution versus U.S.? Or what else explains the real strength internationally? Edward McGowan : Store, this is Ed. I'll take that one. So I'll answer it in two ways. First is the -- we record the revenue where the customer is based. So to the extent that there's a U.S. customer that has a launch, that would be considered U.S. revenue. But you bring up a really good point. As these folks start to look internationally, we tend to get a greater share of that traffic as our international deployment is much greater than anyone.  On the international revenue growth, we're seeing very, very strong growth. If you remember a couple of years ago, we made significant investments in our go-to-market capabilities and also our network that we're seeing great traction, especially in Asia Pacific. And we recently closed on our acquisition with Exceda and expect to see some decent growth down there as well as that's sort of an underserved market. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then maybe one follow-up, Tom, for you. Looking at some of the newer security, specifically SWG and Identity Cloud, how should we think about the ramp of those solutions within your Security portfolio in context of that $1 billion-plus revenue guidance for 2010. Thomson Leighton : Yes, it's early days for both. We're just launching the Secure Web Gateway. That will be part of Enterprise Threat Protector 3.0. We're really excited about that market. But early days, and we're just starting to get the bookings now. So for that to be a major contributor, you're looking at 2021, 2022. Identity Cloud met plan this year, and that's already, because of an acquisition, further along. And we're excited about the potential there in terms of privacy, regulation compliance. As you know, we've now got CCPA in effect in California. Other states are looking to put laws into place. GDPR, of course, in Europe. And I think enterprises are going to be looking for help in dealing with that. So we're optimistic about the future growth there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim. Robert Gutman : From the segment breakout of cloud versus CDN, it seems like, from our perspective, the CDN really outperformed in the quarter. So I guess some of that was attributable -- you said there's $6 million of large Internet platform stuff, specific events. But can you talk with a little more clarity about the additional outperformance in the quarter, a little more specifically? Edward McGowan : Yes, sure. This is Ed. I look at it through two lenses. One, we talked about on the web side, the commerce traffic was much higher than we thought going into the quarter with the Thanksgiving holiday falling as late as it possibly could and fewer shopping days. We were expecting to see a little bit less traffic, we actually saw more. So we're very happy with that.  And then on the media side, we saw a strong OTT traffic. We saw that, as you mentioned, with the Internet platforms, that event-specific revenue certainly helped. We also saw a very strong live sports, especially across Europe. APJ did a lot better than we had expected in terms of traffic. A good gaming quarter. Software downloads were strong as well as new devices come online. There's a lot of firmware updates and things like that. And just to sort of put it in context for you, the last week of the year was exceptionally strong. On our normal traffic pattern, we tend to see our highest traffic levels on Sundays on a recurring basis. We tend sometimes could be 15% to 20% higher than we normally see during the week.  And between the day before Christmas and New Year's eve, we saw what I would refer to as eight Sundays in terms of elevated traffic, which is something that we typically don't see. So a lot of factors that came into play here, both in our Web business as well as our Media business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : Congrats on an awesome end of the year and success around the new OTT service launches. I guess, first, how are you thinking about enterprise security investments to get stand-alone security sales really moving in 2020 and beyond. Thomson Leighton : Yes. So we have both on the product and product support side and go-to-market with sales specialists and experts in making enterprise security sales, a lot of attention on that. We saw a substantial increase in revenue and bookings this year. Still relatively small, given the early days for Zero Trust and some of the new products that we're bringing out now in enterprise security. And of course, as you know, our head of web sales is an expert in selling enterprise security services. So we've got a lot of expertise there and there's significant investment because we'd like to see that business really ramp up. And I think there's good potential for that. James Fish : Got it. And then how do you plan on positioning the -- specifically the Secure Web Gateway in that market, given you do have a larger -- a large competitor out there that's doing fairly well as well as some of the firewall vendors trying to move into the proxy market. Thomson Leighton : Yes, that's business we want to go out and get. And I think there's a lot of greenfield as well. Those -- in terms of the cloud solution provider for Secure Web Gateway, pretty small total revenue, relatively speaking, to what could be. And I think we're going to have a very competitive offer. And when you combine it with the rest of Akamai Security business, we're the larger player out there. We're well known, we're trusted. We have 1,500 major enterprises using Kona Site Defender already. And in some sense, this is a very natural partner to that to now protect the enterprise employee and the enterprise apps from importing malware, just as we protect the public-facing websites from attacks from the outside. So a lot of synergy with what we are the market leader at, and we have a lot of trust among the major enterprise CSOs out there and the buyers of functionality like Secure Web Gateway. So I am optimistic about our future there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : As we think about these investments you guys are making to sort of build out capacity and be able to handle the growing OTT traffic, I was wondering if I get kind of your perspective on the durability of these OTT revenues over time. As some of these services become bigger and bigger, is there a risk that these will start to sort of go more in-house in Akamai and then the services are going to be more of a transitory step for these OTT companies? Or do you believe that this could be kind of a durable good revenue for you guys over an extended period of time? Edward McGowan : Keith, this is Ed. Good question. Right now, I would say, certainly, in the near term, it looks like it's a nice durable revenue stream for us. I'd encourage you to look at the platform customers. Obviously, we had good stabilization and growth there and it shows that even in the DIY world, there's still a place for Akamai and especially as these folks start to look to go global, that's a big opportunity for us. And it's possible you could see some of these folks take some of the delivery in-house themselves. But just in general, most of the OTT folks out there today are going multi-CDN and I think that there's going to be a place for us. I don't think all of them will go DIY. It's possible that none of them do. But if they do, I think there's still a big place for us. Thomson Leighton : At the end of the day, our goal is to do a better job with quality. We've got incredible scale. And also, we've got a great cost profile, which is unique. And so I think we have a compelling value proposition. And even to the extent folks do some DIY already, we're working in an environment with traffic splitting, as Ed said. And going all DIY is incredibly risky for a business. You have no fail over, it's not their core expertise. And I don't think it makes a lot of sense for these folks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair. James Breen : Just one, can you just give us a little more color on the OTT space and how that sort of manifests itself that you've seen so far in the numbers from a ramp-up perspective as these guys circle launch more, we'll see some more this spring. And how the multi CDN strategy might work? Is there a primary and secondary? Is it sort of -- is the traffic end of being split amongst 2 or 3 people? That would be a lot of help. And then just as we progress through the year, a little bit of color sort of on the margin progression as well. And then obviously, there's the Olympics, right, in December. So how does that impact the business as we've seen in past years? Edward McGowan : Okay. Thought I'd get some help if I didn't get to all of them here. So I'll start with the last one. You talked about margin progression. I made some comments earlier that Q1, I believe where you'll see the lowest operating margin for the year and then it will trend up, and we guided to 30%. In terms of the multi-CDN environment, I would say, today, most big video players and most large software distributors do have a multi-CDN strategy and it can vary. In some cases, we'll do 80%, 90%. In some cases, we might do 25%. Usually, what we find is, as the needs for, say in gaming, capacity becomes a much bigger requirement, we tend to get a lot more share. We get a lot more share when we perform better. We get a lot more share as companies look to expand outside the U.S. It's a lot harder to build out capacity and drive your cost down outside the U.S. where bandwidth is more expensive. And a lot of those folks will look to us to take additional share.  And in terms of how these things ramp, typically, when you see a launch, you'll see a lot of promotion around initial launch, a big spike in traffic, then it sort of levels off. Depending on promotions and things like that, you'll see traffic kind of go up and down, depending on various promotions as well as different types of content. Certain shows are more popular than others, et cetera. And then as they expand outside of -- into new markets, that also is another big jump in traffic.  I think you also asked about the Olympics. That will be in Q3. We talked about sort of the revenue progression as you think about how we go from Q1 into the back half of the year. The back half of the year will be -- you'll start to see a step-up in revenue as we get into a strong Q3 with the Olympics as well as the beginning of the election, and some OTT launches. And then Q4 is obviously our strongest seasonal quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Will Power with Baird. William Power : Yes, just a couple of quick questions. So great to see the continued security strength. I wonder if you could give us any further breakdown as to the sources of the upside there, a 29% growth between Bot Manager, WAF, DDoS? And then as you think about the guidance for 2020, I think you said you expected to see -- exceed $1 billion of revenue. I guess that leaves a lot to interpretation. But that would imply maybe something closer to low 20s. How should we think about that trajectory? Does it really drop that much, or is mid 20s kind of a good place to be for growth? Thomson Leighton : Yes. So we're seeing very strong growth in WAF, DDoS, Bot Manager and also our managed security services. The security attack landscape is moving so fast and the adversaries are so capable that more and more leading enterprises are turning to us for our services support. And as we talked about on, I think it was the last call that all of these businesses are now more than $100 million a year for us, and that's what's driving the bulk of the dollar growth right now. And behind that, we have the newer products that we talked about. I listed the 5 of them coming to market -- have come to market in the last year or are coming to market. And I don't think they'll drive a ton of the growth next year, but that's what keeps the growth going I think beyond next year. We'll see upside. And if the products really take off, for example, Page Integrity, we could see some revenue that starts helping the growth by the end of the year, but those are really to keep it sustained over the longer haul. Ed, do you want to add? Edward McGowan : Yes. So we didn't provide specific guidance, but obviously, if you get to exceed over $1 billion and you're about the 20% range, I think that's probably a decent place to peg the models for now. And if you recall last year, we started the year thinking we'd do it in the mid-20s and ended up at 30%. So I was just pegging it in the 20% range, and we'll continue to update you as we go. There's still a lot of room to go in our installed base. Only 55% of our customers today buy security products. That's up about 7% from last year. So there's still a long way to go. And only 28% of our customers are buying two or more. So a lot of room in the installed base and a lot of our new security sales of customers are being led by security first. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Alexander Henderson : I was hoping to ask a little bit of a question around the pricing environment, particularly as we've moved volumes out of the monolithic web 2.0 customers into the splintering of a lot of smaller customers, but still relative scale. Are you seeing some benefit from the relative pricing between those 2 as that movement happens? And then along the same lines, how do we think about the initial scramble among the various players to try to get share? Has pricing been more aggressive because of that, less aggressive? What are you seeing on the pricing front? Edward McGowan : Yes, so this is Ed. I'll take that one. I've said this in the past that the pricing market, the pricing for high-volume media tends to be pretty efficient, and really, it's volume that drives it. And in terms of the pricing environment, I haven't seen people get super aggressive in terms of anything that's outside the norm when it comes to grabbing share. And I would say, at this point, customers are really more interested in the quality than the price because the pricing right now, and there's not a ton of differential between the different players at certain volumes, it really just comes down performance in terms of share. Alexander Henderson : Great. And just sort of follow-up on that would be, obviously, there's a parsing of traffic share out based on various geographies, various cities and the like. Over time, I would think that there will be a reshuffling as people either deliver good service. You guys deliver high-quality service, somebody else might stumble. How long a process does that take? Is it a quarter or two? Or is it much faster than that, if there's quality issues? Edward McGowan : Well, it depends. I mean, a lot of times, you can see share shifts immediately. It depends on how the customers actually load balancing traffic. We've had instances where, in the last couple of quarters, in particular, where some of our competitors have stumbled and had significant trouble and we'll see a big shift of traffic move over to us. In some cases, that will stay for the long term. In some cases, as the company who's had trouble fixes their trouble, it will move back. But it can be pretty quick. And I can tell you that a lot of these media customers have gotten pretty sophisticated in terms of how they're looking at quality, and there's a lot of different metrics that they measure. And you're absolutely right. To the extent that somebody is struggling in a particular city, it could be in a particular city on a particular operator network or with a particular device type, where they'll shift share depending on who's performing better based on all sorts of different metrics that they're looking at. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits : Congrats on the good quarter. First, on the onetime event, could you tell us anything more about the general nature of it. I mean, frequently, you talk about 1 at a time events not having that big an impact. And was it in the IP platform group because they had obviously had a big bump. Edward McGowan : Yes, Michael, this is Ed. Yes, they were in the IP platform. Obviously, there's not a lot of customers that sort of want to get too specific. But in general, event-driven revenue sometimes can be for our large-scale launches or big video events, et cetera, where customers will come to us for a variety of different reasons. In some cases, it's for services or security or for capacity or for delivery. So just kind of think about it in that light that it's for specific events that we were asked to help out a couple of customers, and we're happy to do it, and we're always looking for that type of business. But you're right. I mean, if you look at it in the grand scheme of things, $6 million on a $772 million quarter is not all that material. But certainly, a good business, and we're always happy to take it. Michael Turits : And then I wanted to ask you about margins. Obviously, you haven't given any guidance beyond the 30% EBIT. But what are the puts and takes? And how do you think about it strategically at that point? There are so many interesting places that you could invest that would hit the income statement, especially on the security side. So how do you think strategically about that balance? Thomson Leighton : Yes. So we haven't -- we're not going to give guidance for 2021 or beyond at this point. And we're focused on the 30% for this year. And we always want to be as efficient as we can. And it's across the board in decreasing the cost to serve traffic from our servers through better software. We had a lot of people working on that. It's being efficient with where we allocate our headcount dollars. It's efficient in terms of our procurement functions. So that's always a focus, and we're going to do as well as we can do. Now you're right, there can be trade-offs. We're making significant investments in the business. Obviously, CapEx to increase our scale advantage over the competition on a global basis. We're making a lot of investments in innovation, particularly in the security product area. As I mentioned before, the landscape there moves so quickly, and we're in a great position, but we want to stay ahead with the development of new capabilities there. And so as we see opportunities, we do make investments to keep revenue growth being strong and hopefully make it better over time. And there's a balance. We want to be fiscally responsible. We proved we can do that. We've already grown our operating margin by 5 points over the last 2 to 3 years, and we'll take the step with another point this year. At the same time, it's really important for us to be investing in innovation or new products to drive future growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : I wanted to ask sort of a follow-up to Alex Henderson's question, but really more from a different perspective. As we see the investments that you're making in capacity, I wanted to ask more about your views on capacity in the overall market and how that's informed pricing across the industry. So as you look at capacity across the industry today in your own plans, how do you view the level of capacity available in the market compared to demand? Edward McGowan : Hey, Brad, this is Ed. Yes, that's a good question. I would say that Tom just talked about hitting a peak of 140 terabits per second today. That's becoming more of a norm. It seems that on Tuesdays tends to be the day that you see lots of software and gaming releases. And it's more and more players now are having much, much bigger needs in terms of these big spikes in capacity, and our day-to-day traffic continues to rise. I talked about that Sunday phenomenon. I would say that our customers certainly are getting a lot more nervous about capacity and talking to us way in advance of these, whether it's a new launch or going into a new geography. And certainly, when they're doing new games, picking up the phone and talking to us about the concern about capacity. You've got folks spending hundreds of millions of dollars on rights for sporting events and hitting new peaks every year. So it is becoming a bit of a premium here. Now does it translate into per gigabyte pricing? Not always, no. But in some cases, you can get capacity reservation fees, where you can guarantee somebody a block of capacity. And customers are, in some cases, willing to pay for that. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. And if I could just follow-up with one on security. Any color that you can offer on your success selling security outside of your existing customer base? And perhaps if you can touch on the impact that your carrier partners are having on the security business this quarter, and any insight that you might have to what you're expecting out of them in 2020. Thomson Leighton : Yes. Obviously, most of our security revenue, as we talk about products like WAF and Bot Manager, which tend to be sold to our traditional base. DDoS prevention, particularly the Prolexic capabilities, can go more broadly. Anybody operating a data center that has critical capabilities and that's connected, they got to worry about DDoS attacks and so we do pick up an expanded base there. I think going forward, the enterprise capabilities, the Secure Web Gateway, Multi-Factor Authentication, Enterprise Defender, that brings us into a whole new scope of potential customers and verticals that we don't service a lot today. And that's one reason you're really excited about the enterprise security business as a component. Mentioned the carrier side, we do have great relationships, as I probably know, with the world's major carriers, pretty much all of them. And we have developed security products that we make available to them on a white label basis. And that's where they would then go and attack the small and medium business market. We talked about last time on the call, our SPS service, which is a version of sort of a lower end of our enterprise security, Enterprise Threat Protector solution. But the carriers sell it under their own brand and they go live with it. And that's a great model for us. We don't even touch the customer there, but it generates growing revenue. So we do work with the carriers closely around our security solutions. Some of them also resell our regular enterprise-class solutions as well. Edward McGowan : Yes. And just to add on that, what you asked about, Brad, just on the impact for the quarter. There's one thing just to highlight that we did -- similar to last year, we had some licensed pull-ins from Q1 about $3 million or $4 million of security license sales to the carriers that were expected to hit in Q1, that hit in Q4. So just keep that in mind as you're modeling out the security business in Q1. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : This is Caroline on for Heather. So given your acquisitions of Janrain and KryptCo, do you guys feel like you have a complete product set to be competitive in the identity and zero trust market? who and do you typically compete against in those markets? Thomson Leighton : Yes, I think we do. And in fact, we've been named as the leader there, if you look at the Forrester Magic Quadrant. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the leader in our Zero Trust strategy. So I think we're really excited about it. And it's not just Janrain and KryptCo, but now Secure Web Gateway being added to Enterprise Threat Protector, Enterprise Application Access, which take you through out of the world where you're getting network layer access, which is leading to so many of the data breaches and now access is being controlled at the app layer. And once it's -- a customer is using that, then we can actually apply our services like Kona Site Defender to scrub all traffic from \"trusted devices\" that are internal to make sure they're not spreading malware because it's so easy to get malware onto a device. You don't want it to spread within an enterprise. And you want to make sure that the enterprise is an exfiltrating sensitive data to botnets. And those are the capabilities we bring to market now with Enterprise Defender. And I think Janrain and KryptCo add to that and make it even stronger. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. And then just really quickly on the Internet platform customers. Could you remind us of who the big Internet platform customers are that might tend to drive some upside surprise? And then how should we think about that revenue line trending going forward? Like should we expect it to be growing positively year-over-year versus in prior years where it was declining? Edward McGowan : Yes. So this is Ed. I'll take that question. So in terms of the way to think about the model going forward, obviously, with these customers, there are 6 of them and we have renewals from time to time. So I would sort of model that out at about $40 million a quarter roughly. We'll be looking for upside, obviously, as we go, but that's probably a decent place to put a mark in the sand. And in terms of the customers, it's the giant Internet platforms, it's Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix is in that group of customers. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Timothy Horan : Tom, it's kind of interesting how you have such peaks in utilization of the network in Sundays and Tuesdays and different days of the week. Is there ways to kind of smooth that utilization out? Because, essentially, it's almost 0 marginal cost -- the networks there and you're not using it all that much. And I guess, with some of these new products that you have on enterprise and security, do they leverage the network in unique ways so that you can have unique products and services versus anyone out there? Thomson Leighton : Yes. So surely, you have two questions there. And the second one on how does security mesh with the platform in getting leverage. That's a great question because we get fantastic leverage of our edge platform with security. The same servers and equipment and bandwidth and colo that's used to deliver these fabulous amounts of traffic, that same infrastructure and expense is used to absorb these gigantic attacks. And Akamai is unique in being able to absorb and defend against these giant attacks. And that's because we have fabulous amounts of capacity. So we get great financial leverage and infrastructure leverage with our edge network. And also, the edge is really important, as we've talked about, for delivering traffic. If you're not at the edge, you don't get access to the bandwidth that you need to give high-performance delivery of video or software. And being at the edge is where you need to be to absorb all the attack traffic right as it's coming on to the Internet. If you wait and try to do it at the data center, you're going to get overwhelmed and it doesn't work. So really strong leverage there. Now in terms of the network peaks, they're not -- it's not wildly different. I look at it now and you look at our traffic charge, and the minimum at night, on the least day of the week, is sort of what the peak was across the entire platform a couple of years ago. So it's not huge differences in the peaks and the troughs. And you can never make it totally flat because it's our customers that are driving that. And when they want to distribute a new game and they want everybody to get it quick or there's a live event, or you've got people home at night watching their OTT, well, we got to supply the capacity for that.  So I don't think you'll ever see a world where it's exactly the same amount of traffic every hour of the day or every day of the week. But we're in pretty good shape there when you look at the traffic plots. Timothy Horan : Great. And how unique do you think your infrastructure still is at this point? I mean, there's a lot of people building CDNs and said they have CDNs, a lot of the hyperscalers building out CDNs. Just any thoughts on what you're seeing out there? Thomson Leighton : Yes, we are very unique. And you can see it in so many ways. Part of the uniqueness is that we really are an edge platform. Now these days, edge has become a buzzword. And so everybody says they're an edge network. It's just not true. And the way you can measure that is how many distinct locations do they have servers. And we're in 4,000 places. We're in 1,000 different cities. We're in over 1,500 networks. Nobody gets anywhere close to that. And so that's one way we're unique. You can also see it in the scale of our business, the traffic levels that we're serving. You can see it in the security business. Who's out there with our kind of security revenue in a real cloud service. You can't find really anything close to that. And it's because, again, of the edge platform and all the technology we built on top of it. Now you're right. There's a lot of CDNs. More and more, there's dozens of CDNs around the world. But they are tiny in comparison in terms of what they can do. And I think you have to look beyond the marketing, the buzzwords, to see what are they really doing? What are they really capable of? What are the -- where are their servers really located. And also take a hard look at the financials. Are they profitable, or are they trying to buy some revenue? Do they have a scalable model that some day really is going to be profitable? And I think it really is important to take a close look because there's just a lot of hype, and a lot of buzz and some big IPOs, and it's not real. We are unique. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Unidentified Analyst : This is Michael on for Colby. How should we be thinking about the level of M&A you could do while still being able to achieve your 30% operating margin target? Thomson Leighton : Yes, our plan is to achieve 30% this year. And we're always looking for good acquisitions that can help us provide more value to our customers and to grow revenue. And of course, we're very disciplined buyers. So it's not that we're doing a lot of deals and we're very careful before we do larger deals. And as we look at the year ahead, we expect to do some deals, and we expect to hit 30% operating margins. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. Brandon Nispel : Great. One for Ed, one for Tom. I think, Ed, what are really the puts and takes in your guidance for 2020, does it specifically embed that you capture a certain percentage of traffic from new OTT services? And then maybe for Tom, along those lines, how are you going to measure the company's success in what seems to be a growing OTT market? Edward McGowan : The first one. So we included in our guidance that we will participate in a lot of the OTT services that are coming to market, and some that are expanding. It's really hard to call how successful these will be. I mean, we have conversations with the customers. We know what their plans are. We make sure we build our capacity to be able to capture as much of the traffic that we can. But it really does come down to end consumer demand. It comes down to hours watched, how active the subscribers are, comes down to bit rate. So really hard to tell, but we've got some models from the past that we use and try to leverage. But you really don't know until you get a few months under your belt exactly how big and successful these will be. But we do the best we can to try to bake in an assumption for a good level of success. Thomson Leighton : Yes. Yes. And to your second question, obviously, we measure success in terms of revenue, margin and profit and the growth of those metrics and at a different level. And strategically, we measure it in terms of share, scale, performance and reliability. And our goal is to grow our share, have even more massive scale to be -- continue our reliability. I think already today, we're the go-to player, if you ask any of the big OTT guys. And we want to grow that further. And we are making investments, and you see it in the CapEx. For example, you don't see it as easily in terms of the OpEx and the salaries of the people that are working on making the performance even better and the reliability even better because we're making the bet that OTT usage is going to grow a lot over the next several years. And then as that happens, we want to capture a lot of that on Akamai and to do it profitably. We worry a lot about cost, making our CapEx be a lot more cost-efficient to run, to get a lot more bits per second out of each dollar of CPU. So strategically, it's about increasing our capacity, reliability, scale and share with the goal of generating more revenue, profit and, of course, margins. Brandon Nispel : And maybe if I could just follow-up on Ed's comments. Ed, it sounds like you are definitely including traffic from some new OTT services. Does your expectation include that you capture what would be your typical video traffic share in the market or something more or less than that? Edward McGowan : Yes, I think I would say it's the typical share that were expected. But obviously, we're going to do our best to get as much as we can. But in terms of modeling perspective, you just put in what you think is a normal share based on the various customers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Rishi Jaluria : Quick, quick ones. One for Tom, one for Ed. Tom, on the -- I just wanted to maybe get your perspective, Janrain's about a year since you closed the acquisition. I wanted to get a sense for how it's performed relative to your expectations and how you're thinking about that product as a driver within your Security business. And just some questions on margins. I wanted to understand -- you clearly saw a lot of strength in OTT and internationally, want to understand what the -- maybe gross margin implications of both of those are as they become an increasing mix shift? Thomson Leighton : Yes, this is Tom. I'll take the first one. Yes, we made our revenue plan on Janrain this year. We're doing well with the integration. I think as we look forward, we're excited about the potential for helping major enterprises comply with the increasing and more diverse regulations that are being passed. A lot of our customers do business across many states and countries. And it's harder and harder for them, with largely their homegrown solutions, to keep up with compliance. Now that's a new industry, really. And so that will take some time to develop. But I think has exciting potential for the future. And Ed, do you want to take the margin? Edward McGowan : Yes, sure. So in terms of margins, obviously, the OTT media business is a lower margin than, say, our Security business. So as the mix shifts, you can get a slight movement. I think we're -- we talked about being down about 1 point year-on-year, but I think it's really more in the round. And then in terms of international, one of the things that we did several years ago that was really smart is we made a significant investment in our carrier relationships. And Tom talked about being in thousands of locations and thousands of cities around the world. By having so much traffic, we feel -- we provide a lot of value to the carriers. So we get generally very favorable economics in some of the hard-to-reach places that tend to be really expensive. So the margin internationally, in most places, is pretty decent for us. So again, just the way to think about it is your media business is going to be slightly lower on the gross margin line, your security business is going to offset that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lee Krowl with B. Riley FBR. Lee Krowl : Great. Hats off on the good execution. Two quick questions. Just from a multi-CDN approach. Geographically speaking, with the rollout of some of these OTT streaming launches, just given your guidance of scale relative to your competitors, do you kind of anticipate that with your scale, you could perhaps garner more share as some of these services go internationally, just based on your ability to execute and provide capacity where perhaps your peers cannot? Thomson Leighton : Yes, that is the plan. And that's what we've been talking about is to leverage our massive edge platform that exists all around the world. We're in 1,000 different cities and several of these OTT businesses are global in nature. And so it is our goal to leverage the scale and the performance and our reliability that's established there to gain share. Edward McGowan : Yes, so just to add a little bit here, like I said, we spent a lot of time investing with our relationships with the carriers around the world. And there are some really challenging places to build out capacity. Latin America, in particular, is one that's very challenging. And we see outsized share in countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, across the Middle East and India, again, areas that are a little bit harder for some of our competitors to get to. And also, it requires an investment in people to be able to go out, establish those relationships and build out the capacity. So I think we're very smart in our approach in terms of our investments, and we're continuing to invest, and a lot of what we're doing with our CapEx is we're building more and more capacity outside the U.S. Lee Krowl : Got it. And then just a second question, more of a housekeeping question. But are there any anticipated major renewals in 2020? Edward McGowan : So there's always going to be lots of renewals throughout the year. And -- but I did last quarter, I'll do this last year, excuse me, and I'll do again this year, is I'll call out if there's anything going into a quarter that needs to be highlighted but we've factored that into our guidance. Thomson Leighton : Yes. And one of the nice things is that we're much more diverse in our customer base now. We don't have customers that account for 10% or more of our revenue. In fact, you take the giants there, and they're all like 2% or 3% at most. So there's much less impact to our business now if a giant customer has a major repricing. Tom Barth : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Jeffrey Van Rhee : Great. Just maybe two quick ones for me. First, on the network utilization, how is the target utilization rate changed over the last 3 years with respect to the overall network utilization? And I think of that, particularly in light of multi-CDN, our switching strategy is becoming easier. And then the second question, shift gears over to sales, if you would. And I'm just curious, going into '20, how did you tweak the comp or sales structure approaches? Namely what particular behaviors, new behaviors did you try to incent? Looking for what changed there. Thomson Leighton : Yes. I don't know that there's a fundamental change in network utilization strategy. I think there is -- we do, as Ed mentioned, in many cases, get reservation fees. The capacity on the Akamai platform is enormous, but it's not infinite. And we want customers to understand that if they may need to have large amounts of capacity, we need to have that conversation upfront and plan for it. And it doesn't -- we're not just going to sit and not have traffic and all of a sudden take it because somebody else falls over. And so I think with almost all the major customers out there, we have a very strong relationship. We have a large fraction of the traffic, and we have an understanding of what more we might take in the event they have problems with other vendors, if they're doing traffic splitting. Ed, do you want to talk about the sales comp? Edward McGowan : Yes, on the sales compensation, there's really no major change this year. We had talked about two years ago, we have made some big changes in the media world to help them focus on gaining share and selling security. But in terms of the tweak we're making to the comp plans this year, there's nothing really major to call out. Tom Barth : Thank you, Jeff. In closing, we will be presenting at several investor conferences and events throughout the rest of the first quarter. Details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. We want to thank you for joining us, and have a wonderful evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section at akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom. And thank you all for joining us today. Before I get into the numbers, I want to acknowledge how much the world has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. All of our lives have been impacted in ways that would have been hard to imagine only a short while ago. At Akamai, our primary concern is for the health and safety of our employees, their loved ones, our customers and partners, and the communities where we work and live. Fortunately, we're in a position where almost all of our employees can work remotely, and we've been doing that successfully for the last two months. We've also implemented special measures to protect employees who need to travel, for example, to a data or operation center. And we're doing what we can to help employees to face especially challenging situations as a result of the pandemic. As businesses and consumers around the globe adjust their routines in the interest of public health, the internet is being used at a scale that the world has never experienced. In addition to the hundreds of millions of people who've been working from home, governments are leveraging the internet to keep citizens informed and to provide economic assistance. Houses of worship are streaming services and communities are engaging online to relieve the social isolation felt by many. And of course, education, commerce and entertainment are now almost entirely online. As much of the world hunkers down in place, Akamai is continuing to work behind the scenes to keep the internet functioning as a lifeline for organizations and people everywhere. I'll talk more in a minute about Akamai\u2019s unique role during the pandemic and the impact of the pandemic on our business. But first, I'll review our Q1 financial performance. I'm pleased to report that Akamai had a very strong first quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue was $764 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 9% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 30%, up 1 point over Q4 and consistent with Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP EPS in Q1 was $1.20 per diluted share, up 9% year-over-year and up 11% in constant currency. These excellent results were driven by the continued strong performance of our security solutions, greater than expected traffic levels, and by our continued focus on operational efficiency. As more business is conducted over the internet, the ability to scale becomes critical. And when it comes to scale, Akamai is the clear leader. Traffic on our platform increased dramatically in March as enterprises turned to Akamai to move more of their operations online. Despite the cancellation or postponement of major sporting events, like March Madness, and Champions League Soccer, our traffic increased by about 30% over a four-week period at the end of Q1. Traffic reached a peak of 167 terabits per second, which was more than double the peak of the first quarter of 2019. We're very pleased that the capacity we added to the platform last year has enabled us to help our customers, when they need us most. We're also making a big difference when it comes to helping the major carriers handle the explosion in demand. That's because we've deployed our infrastructure deep into carrier networks and close to end users, thereby offloading an enormous amount of traffic that would otherwise congest core backbones and routers. Of course, performance is also critical as businesses move the majority of their operations online. Although some other companies have experienced cases of performance degradation and even extended outages in recent months, I'm very happy to report that Akamai's performance has remained consistent and strong over the past quarter. In fact, our measurements indicate that the page download times provided by our industry leading Ion service has significantly improved over the past year. This is in spite of the large increase in traffic, and is a direct result of our relentless efforts to improve the performance of our services. Akamai is also helping to protect many of the world's major enterprises as more employees work from home and as IT departments increase their focus on business continuity. We believe that Akamai\u2019s market leading security services are needed now more than ever, as attackers take advantage of the pandemic to ramp up their exploits on enterprises across all verticals. In Q1, our cloud-based security portfolio generated $240 million in revenue, up 28% year-over-year in constant currency. Sales continue to be led by our flagship services for DDoS prevention, application-layer firewall and bot management. We also saw a strong surge in bookings for our next-gen Zero Trust enterprise security solutions. The strong demand we saw in Q1 for our security and media services more than offset the reduced revenue we received from companies that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, especially in the travel and hospitality vertical. Where appropriate, we are modifying the terms of these customers\u2019 contracts to provide them some relief and flexibility, often in return for extended contract line. We value our customers and want them to think of Akamai as a supportive and reliable partner for the long run. We are fortunate that our financial strength enables us to provide assistance to customers in need, which we believe will benefit our shareholders and the global economy over the long term. We've also played an important role in helping to support websites and applications associated with response to the pandemic. And the Akamai Foundation is providing sustainable financial assistance for numerous relief efforts around the world. Most of all today, I want to recognize and thank our nearly 7,800 employees for working so hard to serve the thousands of organizations and billions of internet users who rely on us during these very-challenging times. I couldn't be proud of the way that our people have stepped up and of what they're managing to accomplish, despite their own personal challenges and dealing with a pandemic. Their spirit and leadership during a time of crisis is a key part of what makes Akamai such a unique and strong company. Lastly, I want to offer a warm welcome to our Board's newest member, Marianne Brown. Marianne joined Akamai's Board last month and brings with her extensive financial and operational expertise, as well as valuable leadership experience with global technology-driven companies. I'll now turn the call over to Ed for more details on our Q1 performance and our outlook for Q2. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. Before I begin, I would also like to thank our fellow employees for their amazing work and dedication. And I would like to acknowledge our customers and partners, especially those who have been hardest hit by the global pandemic. Today, I plan to review our Q1 results, discuss the impact the pandemic is having on our business and provide Q2 guidance and an update on the full year. As Tom mentioned, we delivered a very strong quarter on both the top and bottom line. Q1 revenue was $764 million, up 8% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency, driven by a significant increase of global traffic, as well as continued strong growth across our security portfolio. Revenue from our Media and Carrier division was $358 million, up 8% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency. The outperformance in media was primarily due to the surge in traffic from OTT video, gaming, social media and news and information sites as more and more people around the world began to shelter in place. Revenue from our internet platform customers was $45 million, in line with our expectations. Revenue from our Web division was $406 million, up 8% year-over-year and 10% in constant currency. Revenue growth for this group of customers was again driven by our security business. Moving on to revenue by geography. International revenue was $335 million, up 16% year-over-year or 19% in constant currency. We continue to see very strong international growth, especially in APJ. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative $3 million impact to revenue on a sequential basis and had a negative $7 million impact on a year-over-year basis. Sales in our international markets represented 44% of total revenue in Q1, up 3 points from Q1 2019 and up 2 points from Q4 level. Revenue from our U.S. markets was $429 million, up 3% year-over-year. Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with our expectations. GAAP gross margins, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 65%, down a point from Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $260 million, in line with expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $327 million, up $8 million from Q4 and up 9% in the same period in 2019. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 43%, up 2 points from Q4 and up 1 point from Q1 of 2019. Non-GAAP operating income was $230 million, up $8 million from Q4 levels and up $20 million or 9% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30%, up 1 point from Q4 levels and consistent with Q1 of last year. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $136 million. This was lower than our guidance range, given some pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and travel restrictions that delayed some planned network buildup. However, thanks in part to the capacity work we undertook in 2019, we are very pleased that we've been able to maintain network resiliency during this virus outbreak. Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $123 million or $0.75 cents of earnings per diluted share. This included a restructuring charge of about $11 million associated with the prior actions I mentioned on our last quarterly call. We did not take any new restructuring actions during Q1. Non-GAAP net income was $196 million or $1.20 of earnings per diluted share, up 9% year-over-year, up 11% in constant currency, and $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range, due to higher than expected revenue in the quarter. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $35 million based on a Q1 effective tax rate of 15%. This was slightly better than we expected, due to stronger than expected growth outside the U.S. Now, I will turn to some balance sheet items. We believe that our balance sheet is strong. We anticipate that we can maintain this position in the face of the current economic uncertainty. As of March 31st, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.2 billion. Our total debt at the end of Q1 remained unchanged at $2.3 billion. As a reminder, our debt is comprised of two convertible notes with par values of $1.15 billion each and maturity in 2025 and 2027, respectively. Now, I will review our use of capital. During the first quarter, we spent $81 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 900,000 shares. We have approximately $750 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. We plan to continue to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution, resulting from equity compensation over time and subject to global financial conditions. In summary, we are very pleased with our Q1 results. Given these uncertain times and with the increased volatility we are seeing in global markets, I thought it would be helpful to provide some additional context on the impact that the recent elevated traffic levels may have on our media division and the negative impact the pandemic may have on some key verticals in our Web division. First, as Tom mentioned, with many countries around the world issuing shelter-in-place orders, we have seen a dramatic increase in media traffic across our platform. We expect this elevated traffic to continue to have a positive impact on our Q2 results. However, we anticipate that traffic levels may start to moderate if life begins return to normal, and as the warmer summer months get underway in our larger markets. As an aside, some of you may be wondering about live sports. As a reminder, no individual live event has a significant impact on our results. And to-date, the stronger traffic from shelter-in-place orders has more than offset the impact of live sports cancellations and postponements. Moving now to our Web division. There are two verticals notably impacted by the global pandemic, travel and hospitality, and commerce and retail. Travel and hospitality vertical accounted for roughly 4% of total Akamai revenue in Q1. This vertical is comprised of over 200 customers globally, including some of the largest airlines, hotels, cruise lines and travel-related sites. Most of these customers have seen sharp declines in demand. The trend is expected to continue throughout 2020. Our commerce and retail vertical is an area we have highlighted for some time as being under financial pressure. This vertical includes more than 900 customers globally and represents approximately 16% of Akamai's total revenue. So, while we have seen a recent traffic uptick with some customers, other customers are struggling, especially those that rely heavily on brick and mortar operations. We believe they could become increasingly challenged, the longer the shelter-in-place orders continue. As Tom mentioned, we have already begun to work with many of our customers whose businesses have been impacted by the pandemic. Q1 was negatively impacted by approximately $5 million due to a combination of contract restructurings and elevated bad debt reserves. Although it is difficult for us to project the total impact, we do expect to incur additional charges in the coming quarters, if the economy continues to suffer. I'd now like to provide our outlook for the second quarter. We are projecting Q2 revenue in the range of $752 million to $778 million, or up 6% to 12% in constant currency over Q2 2019. Given the COVID-related impacts on the business I just discussed, we expect to see continued sequential growth in our media division and a slight decline sequentially on our Web division is Q2. At current spot rates, foreign exchange is expected to have a negative $7 million impact on Q2 revenue compared to Q1 levels and have a negative $11 million impact on a year-over-year basis. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $252 million to $260 million. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of approximately 43%. Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $98 million to $101 million. We expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 30% for Q2. Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $186 million to $206 million, excluding equity compensation in the second quarter. This assumes there's not a significant change in the overall economic environment and that we will catch up on our CapEx spend for the first half of 2020 in Q2. With the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.18 to $1.24, or up 14% to 20% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of approximately $34 million to $36 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 15%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of proximately 164 million shares. As our Q1 results and Q2 guidance demonstrate, we are optimistic about the continued strength of our business, even in the light of the pandemic. As you're seeing from other companies reporting, however, it has become much more challenging to predict economic conditions, resulting customer impacts in the second half of the year. As a result of this uncertainty, especially as it relates to the holiday shopping season in Q4, we are withdrawing full year 2020 guidance at this time. We plan to reassess providing annual guidance next quarter as we gain additional insights into the direction of the global economy. We're very thankful for the resiliency of our employees, the diversification of our revenue, the strength of our customer relationships and our strong balance sheet. We believe we are well-positioned to continue to help our customers during this very difficult time by providing them with the best and most secure digital experiences around the world. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Will Power with Baird. Will Power : Great. Okay. Thank you for taking the question. Well, I guess first, I hope everyone in Akamai team is staying as a healthy and safe as possible. Maybe two quick questions, if I can. First, would love to get more granularity if possible on the sources of strength in media? Maybe just trying to understand, the strength in OTT video versus gaming, if there's any way to kind of rank order what you're seeing there? Then, the second question is on security, given the uncertain climate and questions on IT budgets. Maybe just talk about how you're thinking about security growth going forward and what you're seeing in terms of potential lengthened sales cycles versus the need for work-at-home capabilities. Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. I'll take the first one, Tom, and maybe you take the second one. So, the strength in media really came, like I mentioned in the earlier remarks, we really saw strength across several different sub verticals in media, probably the largest would be in OTT video. It also was a very, very strong gaming quarter, especially in March. And really, we saw a significant uptake in traffic over the last couple of weeks of March. And as the shelter-in-place orders came around the world as we got to places like Europe, India, and the U.S., we really saw a dramatic increase. So, there's pretty much strength across the board and really across the globe as well. Tom Leighton : Yes. And first, thanks for the concern about Akamai employees. And I'm happy to report that by and large, we're all doing well. In terms of the question on security growth, it\u2019s looking very strong. And partly, that's because the attackers aren't held back by the pandemic or working remotely. In fact, we've seen a substantial increase in attack activity. And, perhaps -- that perhaps they're doing that because they know IT managers have a lot of other things that they got to worry about in terms of supporting their workforce remotely that increases vulnerabilities. And so, it's really a perfect storm for the attackers to run their exploits. And we have products that are really well-designed to help major enterprises deal with that, both for securing their websites and apps and also for securing access for their employees who are now remote, all of a sudden. And so, we've seen a very strong uptick in bookings for enterprise security products. And I guess, the last point there is, our customer base is the world's major enterprises. And they're going to fare better than most through the pandemic. And we have very good relationships. And so, we're in a better position to provide them with the new security capabilities or the increased capacity that they're going to need for the security products. So, on balance, I think the security business is looking very strong. And of course, we're all hoping that the global recession doesn\u2019t really deepen or persist for a long time. Will Power : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Thank you, guys, for taking the question and very nice quarter. So, two questions, one on -- as we think about Q2, any quantification you could give us in terms of kind of the puts and takes, and particularly on sort of the drags of having to reprice some of those contracts -- or I\u2019m assuming reprice, having to amend some of those contracts on the performance side of the equation? Any sense you could give us and just like what kind of impact that has on Q2? And then, on the flip side of the equation, is it possible to quantify kind of the -- your expectation for how well this sort of up traffic is going sustain into Q2, like how much of that did you actually put into the guide on a go forward basis? Ed McGowan : Sure. Hey, Keith. It\u2019s Ed. So, let\u2019s start with the Web division. Obviously, what I tried to do was call on a couple of verticals that our customers are experiencing some significant challenges. So, we're dealing with those on a case by case basis. And in the prepared remarks, I talked a little bit about how we expect to see a slight -- sequential decline in the web business. And really what that's all about is a couple of things that we have to take into consideration. In some cases, the customers will come direct to us and ask us if there's anything we can do to help them during this period of time where there's a lot of uncertainty. In some cases, we'll amend contracts and we'll get something in exchange for that. In other cases, we have to assess the ability of the customer to pay us. And so, there's some customers in particular in certain geographic areas of the country that we're more concerned about. And if you don't have -- if you have any concern about the customers\u2019 ability to pay, you have to reserve that revenue. So, the combination of that is going on. I am encouraged to see that the capital markets have been open. And we've seen a number of customers that have been able to secure funding. There's obviously availability with certain government bailout programs and things like that. But, it is an area that we're keeping a close eye on. And then, obviously, bankruptcies are another possibility. So, what we did is, we did -- ran a number of different scenarios. And we assumed that we would continue to see additional pressure in the web business and we would see a slight decline. Obviously, this is out of control -- out of our control, in terms of what's going to happen with this pandemic and also out of the control of our customers in many ways. So, then, on the media side, we assume that this continued strong traffic growth that we saw in March to continue throughout most of the quarter. We made an assumption that in June that we may see a slight decline in the traffic as things hopefully start to get back to normal and the warmer months start to hit. We've seen a pretty strong traffic growth here in April. Keith Weiss : Got it. And just in terms of the nature of the contract negotiations, is it more on billing terms, or does actual pricing change? Give us some color on to what you're willing to give to your customers and is there anything kind of out of bounds in what you're not willing to do in terms of contract amendments? Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. I mean, you take it case by case, we always take the long term view a lot of these customers have been with us for 15 or 20 years. And they certainly take the travel and hospitality vertical. That was a vertical that I never worried about. It's a -- made up of fantastic, amazing companies. They have been always pay on time. They're usually folks that are early adopters of our new solutions, et cetera. But obviously, they just saw demand evaporate here in the second quarter -- excuse me, in the first quarter. So, we work with them. Sometimes it could be you enter into a zero overage contract. A lot of customers are asking for extended terms and payments. So, we have to take that into consideration. Sometimes it's some credit relief, but we do it case-by-case. So, far the customers have been pretty reasonable in terms of their RASK. There haven't been things that have been completely outrageous so far. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : I just want to double click on Will\u2019s question. What are you guys seeing thus far with the security solutions with work-from-home, specifically more about that new cloud, web gateway or security solution and the EAA product? Tom Leighton : Yes. So, strong bookings there. Now, the secure web gateway is just now available in beta and as part of our Enterprise Threat Protector solution, version 3.0. And I think that really increases the strength of the offer. Where we're seeing a lot of the bookings now is an Enterprise Application Access. And you think of that as the VPN replacement, think of that as a thing that lets all your employees who used to just log in, in a physical building now have to do it from home and you need to secure them and you need to scale that overnight. And so, I think that's why we're seeing a real uptake there. And in general, I think, these are the solutions of the future for enterprise security. They enable the zero trust model, they are much more secure within the traditional solutions that enterprises have been using now for decades and can put a big dent in enterprise data breaches in the future. James Fish : And then, on the media side, I mean, one of your peers and in that space get the share loss of some of the streaming services. Were you guys able to capture some of that share, given the Akamai network size or did you see any specific media share gains with some of newer OTT services? Ed McGowan : Yes. So, that's a great question. We did -- one of the things that has been a bit of a challenge in the industry is that there's been a surge of demand, so capacity becomes a bigger component of the equation. And along with that comes performance. So, in some cases, we've seen pretty nice share gains across the board. So, we've been very happy with that in Q1. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Sterling Auty : You mentioned in your prepared remarks that no single live sporting event is a meaningful part of revenue. But, I think you've talked in the past that things like the Olympics and World Cup that span a couple of weeks are more meaningful. So, I'm wondering how you quantified or how you gauged the potential for a fade off in traffic in June, versus the loss of the Olympics this year, within the guide and what we should be thinking as we go into the back half of the year? Ed McGowan : So, I'll get into a little bit of detail on this one, just to try to help you guys out. So, we did talk about there's no individual events is material. Take the Olympics for example. When you think about the Olympics, there's obviously the direct right holders, there's the web traffic that can sometimes go along with an event of that size, the travel and news, and things like that. And then there's also live television. We've got several folks that show live television. And then obviously, the duration of the streaming is what really matters. We do web delivery, we do services, we do security, et cetera. But it's really the length of the streaming. An event like that could be, let\u2019s call it, the $3 million to $5 million range, maybe a few million on a really good year. If I think about live sports in general, it\u2019s probably a little over 1% of our total revenue throughout the year. So, right now, you see in Q1, we certainly more than offset the lack of live sports, and we expect that to happen in Q2. So, in terms of what we've built into our guides, we're assuming that live sports is not fully back up and running and that what we're seeing from the OTT and other gaming and other sub verticals will more than offset that in Q2. Sterling Auty : That's great transparency. Thank you for that. And then, on the security side, can you give us a sense of where the strength is coming from, from this aspect? How much of that strength in spending is new customers coming onto the platform versus existing customers, either taking more product, or existing customers just paying more because of either some sort of volume commitment on any of this or just help peel back the onion a bit on the contributions from the growth in security? Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. Good question, Sterling. So, first of all, I'll take it from a couple of lenses. I'll start off with the product side. So, we saw great strength with strength with Bot Man, KSD services, and EAA and ETP, albeit a bit smaller, good uptake of multiple solutions. And I've provided this metric before in terms of the number of customers that have purchased a security product for up to 57% now, up from 55% last quarter. So, we're seeing good uptake in the installed base and growing there. And also, customers taking on more than one product, customer buying two or more, up to about 29%, that's up 1 point from last quarter as well. So, doing well with the installed base. In terms of bookings, we're seeing new customer bookings, again being led by security. And, again, so you see this stuff in your installed base. And we're also very excited about page integrity. We came up with our limited availability page integrity. We signed a number of customers this quarter and expect to continue to do that throughout the year. Tom mentioned secure web gateway, which is up in beta now and then obviously enterprise has got a long way to go there. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Caroline Liu : Hi. This is Caroline on for Heather. First off, I do want to echo the comments that my colleagues on the line have already made. I do hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy. First off, I wanted to dive a little bit more into the comments that you made about OTT. I'm curious, how has the OTT demand environment trended relative to your expectations, or I guess, put another way, how much of the OTT strength would you characterize as due to the new launches, the share gains versus the general increase in user traffic that was driven by the shelter-in-place orders? Ed McGowan : Yes. Good question. And this is one that I challenged my team to come up with a number. And it's a little difficult. Times like this tend to self-accelerate trends you see in the market and OTT growth being one and obviously cord-cutting being another. And in March is when we really saw a big uptick in traffic. So, there's no doubt that the shelter-in-place really drove a lot of traffic. But we also had a major customer launch a new service over in EMEA. And we had our own models about what we expected. And I would say, we did a little bit better, could be because of the shelter-in-place. But, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s kind of a combination of both the shelter-in-place, but also, we had -- we took some share in some places as well, like I talked about earlier, we have capacity in a lot of places where it really matters, we\u2019re able to outperform some of our competitors in certain areas. So, it's sort of a combination of everything, but I would say that, shelter-in-place certainly did help accelerate the trend that we're seeing in the market. Caroline Liu : Got it. And can you talk through what the demand was like, sort of in the last two weeks of March? And what are you seeing now, especially in areas like APJ where some of the countries have sort of relaxed the shelter-in-place orders and people are starting to return back to their workplaces? Tom Leighton : Yes. The demand increased steadily through March and total traffic increasing from March to April. And you can see, as countries went into shelter-in-place, you see the traffic increased. And I think most of the world is, at least the traffic wise is still in that condition of being high. And as we look forward, we may see more normal growth from here, depending, as Ed said, on live events and OTT launches and so forth. So, APJ, I would say also very strong. And as you know, a lot of our -- got a lot of strong growth there. Caroline Liu : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair. James Breen : Thanks for taking the questions. Just on the CapEx side, you talked about a little bit delay and sort of the expansion that you had, you were prepared for just because some of the build out you did at the end of last year. Is there any concern about those delays continuing and the ability to sort of meet demand from a customer side, as we go forward here? Tom Leighton : Yes. We think we're past the delays. We did have about 90 days of delay on delivery of a bunch of servers, but we've had plenty of capacity. And as you can tell by hitting a peak, which is really what the CapEx governs of doubling year-over-year. And at this point, we think we're in very good shape, with the supply lines and getting the full capacity we want for the rest of the year. We have the tax in all the cities where we need to do that. We do the installation. And we have the approvals from pretty much all the major governments that our folks can move around, even where it\u2019s a very strict lockdown, just because we're such a critical resource in countries around the world. So, we're optimistic, as Ed said, on being able to continue to deploy capacity and to stay ahead of the demand. James Breen : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits : With you guys withdrawing guidance, as I think through your different segments, I\u2019d like to just try to focus on which are the ones that provide that uncertainty. Because it sounds like CDN is strong now. And really, it worst, at least on the media side at worst, come back to the level it was at. Security, it doesn't sound like you think there's some uncertainty that's macro related, but perhaps there isn\u2019t. And you can tell me if you think there is. So, we're left with ecommerce and around travel and retail. So, am I right, Ed that that\u2019s really the reason why we have an uncertainty that caused you to pull guidance in that segment? Ed McGowan : Yes. I mean, obviously, we hated to do that, as we ran our scenarios, there is so much that's out of our control and really impacts our customers. For example, if you run into a second flare-up against in the fall and get into another round of shelter-in-place, how does that impact our customers business, especially in the Web division? Obviously we would be bullish for the media division because we\u2019d see those elevated traffic levels. But on the website, it could be considerable. And what's the consumer going to do, how is the consumer going to behave? And with Q4 being a very strong seasonal quarter for us, you can imagine, as you run through a number of scenarios, your range just gets really wide. And we just didn't think it would be helpful. And that's why we provided some additional color, so, you guys can run your models by giving you some size, relative size and number of customers, et cetera. That's really what's driving, Michael, is just the uncertainty around those Web division customers and more, in particular to what's happening with the virus. There's just so much that's out of all of our controls, and including capital markets. Who knows in the second round right now, it's good to see some of our customers getting funding, but that may close down at the second round happens, and elevated bankruptcies, consumers may not be spending, may not be travelling. So, it's not something that we're experts in and we wanted to give it more time to get some more color rather than providing something we thought was unhelpful. Michael Turits : And then, if I think about CDN as a division, obviously the only thing you\u2019ve guided to is 2Q. But, CDN is made up of both the media side as well as the website. So, do you think that it is enough in traffic to give you an offset to both, live sports and to web that you can see growth in the CDN business year-over-year next quarter? Ed McGowan : So, in Q2, yes, I would say right now there's a good chance that we could see the strength medium, no more than offset live sports and potentially the impact on Web. Right now, we have 60 days to go. And you never know what's going to happen here in the last 60 days, whether it gives you a larger than normal range, but it is possible and I wouldn't be surprised if we saw CDN growth here in Q2. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Tim Horan : Tom, could you maybe step back a second and I can talk about what you kind of expect for a secular shifts in internet usage and trends and maybe how COVID here might change what you guys are doing, your strategy, if at all or, maybe other areas that you might want to invest in as a result of all this? And then, just a quick follow up on security. On the bookings, can you give us maybe just some comparisons of past quarter? Is it like well -- 10 points and above trend that you've seen the last few years or any kind of color around that would be great? Thanks. Tom Leighton : Yes. In terms of the secular shift, I think there's a reasonable prospect that there will be much more use of the internet coming out of this permanently than there was going in. And in many areas, you look at ecommerce and traditionally that was -- the penetration of ecommerce and commerce as a whole has grown about 2% of the year and low to mid teens and pretty much now the large majority of commerce is online. And after people get used to doing that for an extended period, a lot of that share gain may become permanent. That's really good for Akamai. If you look at media, and movie releases being done online, a lot of consumption now moving online. And that may become permanent, a lot of that as well. You look at work from home, there wasn't a lot of that before. But now there's just a ton of it. And after you've done it for a while, I think you may see a lot of that become permanent. And so, just across the board, it's not so much new users of the internet that weren't done a little bit before. But now they're being done at massive scale. And there's a prospect that the scale will be very large coming out. And so, when we look at the secular tailwinds here, obviously, we're worried about a global recession, as Ed talked about. We just have no idea how long or deep that will be. We're hoping we get out of this pandemic situation by the end of the year and things are looking better. That's beyond our control. But once we do emerge, it does seem like there's a lot of strong tailwinds for Akamai. Because the things I described are all the things that we're really good at and the market leaders at. And so, I would say long term view, very bullish about Akamai. It's not a major product shift for us. Obviously, go to market now. We're changing how we do that, because we're not traveling. So, the go-to-market motions are all virtual and digital now. And we've gotten off to a great start there and how many of you came to our virtual edge live event but tremendous attendance there and really good feedback. And so, how we approach customers, how we talk to them physically is changing. And that's fine. We're in good shape there. In terms of the security bookings, yes, for the enterprise security products, very substantial increase year-over-year in Q1.And that seems to be continuing into Q2. So, that is good news. Now, it takes a while for that to turn into revenue, of course. But, that's a very positive development. And I do think that again in the long term, with more employees working from home, and already the need to stop data breaches and protect enterprise applications and data that there is a bright future for our Zero Trust enterprise security products. Tim Horan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. Two questions, if I may. I guess, first I just want to drill a bit further down on bad debt. Wondering if you could provide any more color as it relates to -- as a percentage of revenue or what the actual step up was in the quarter. And what should we be looking for that could suggest that you might have to take it up a little bit further potentially in the second quarter. And then just real quickly on pricing. I'm just curious with the incremental volume that you're seeing tied to the CDN business, whether it's just the broader OTT trend or CD-19 related, if we're seeing any significant material shift in pricing trends. Thank you. Ed McGowan : Sure. I'll take those. Bad debt was up a couple of million this quarter. There's a new accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of January ASC 326, which basically in the past used to look at -- sorry to get wonky here, but in fact, you had to look at the historic and anything that happens within a quarter. Now you have to look at potential future credit losses. So, think of it almost like you're a bank where you're evaluating your trade receivables and having to put up a reserve for potential future credit losses. And I mentioned earlier, we'll be extending out, in some cases, some payment terms to folks. In some cases, as they are just asking for some time. In other cases, like in places like India, they physically can't get into the office and are not set up to do electronic payments. So, we'll be evaluating that as every company that adopts this standard will be doing the same. So, I do expect that debt expenses will go higher, and we did plan for that in our guidance. So, you\u2019ll see in G&A line that that will start to tick up a bit. On the pricing side, pricing in the CDN market, I didn't see anything this quarter that was out of the ordinary. I will say, though, that we are seeing, as I talked about capacity, the push for capacity reservation fees, which essentially is just getting a little on top of what you'd normally get for the cost of this delivery. Capacity is at a premium at this point. So, we are seeing a little bit of a benefit there. But, in terms of the normal pricing environment, it's still volume-based and I don't see a lot of difference in the market at this point. Colby Synesael : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jane Lee [ph] with RBC Capital Markets. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi. Thank you. This is Jane for Mark Mahaney. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe just a couple of points, one on the guidance. You mentioned the vertical weaknesses in your hospitality, travel, commerce. Can you give perhaps ballpark the magnitude of the impact? And maybe just like, do you bake in a similar impact in Q2, or do you expect that in your Q2 guide -- or do you expect that to kind of be a worsening scenario, just given how much of that has just happened in the last month of the quarter? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you. Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So, in the guide, we did expect that we see additional pressure in those verticals and in my prepared remarks I talked about how we expected the Web division to decline slightly. It\u2019s not usually a division that grows very steadily obviously with the exception of a seasonally strong Q4 going to Q1. So, we are anticipating that. So, I did bake in some of that and then included in the range as a various set of scenarios in terms of good, better, best in terms of how we will land. So far in the first 30 days -- or the 28 days of the quarter, I would say, we're trending about what I would have expected, but see how things go here in the next 60 days as we finish up the quarter. Hopefully as some of these countries and states start to come back out of shelter-in-place, we don't see a panic back to things getting worse. And there's more consumer confidence, we don't see as much pressure. But that's how we thought about it. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And another question just on security, maybe pre and post COVID. Maybe parsing out the COVID impact before that really hit and you see a surge in booking. How the growth has been trending versus your expectations and what's kind of the cadence of transition to Zero Trust? And maybe after the COVID impact, you mentioned a few new launches and it has obviously page integrity being one, SWG as well that will be a more material revenue driver in the out years. Now, do you see any of these new product launches actually becoming more meaningful revenue drivers in perhaps this year or next year, sooner than projected? Tom Leighton : Yes. Good question. I would say, the security growth remains very strong. It's been in the high 20s for some time, and we saw that in Q1 as well, and that's going into COVID. I think, the pandemic as we talked about, the rate of attacks is increased as bad as that is, during the pandemic, as the attackers try to take advantage of it, I would say. Now ,the new services like page integrity and secure web gateway and enterprise security and the increased bookings around enterprise, security, those are things that will drive revenue in the future. So, there's some time between bookings and growth. I would say that the pandemic and the stuff that\u2019s happening there helps Zero Trust because in our enterprise security, because there is even more need for it. And in some cases, it's an urgent need. Whereas before there was -- I think it was early days of a trend towards moving to Zero Trust. So, there's an accelerant because of the pandemic. I don't think the pandemic yet you've seen any change in revenue because of it, the same way you would for traffic. Traffic, you monetize that immediately, as soon as you're delivering more, you get the revenue for it. With security products, that more is the bookings and the recurring revenue that's generated as customers find new services or increase the services they have. And so, there -- I think there is benefit, in the future, but we haven't experienced that yet in the same way we have the traffic. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Rishi Jaluria : First, I wanted to go back to retail and commerce as a vertical. Look at -- I know it's been under pressure, even pre-COVID. It feels like certain parts of that vertical though might be doing better than others in this environment, right, especially those like a Walmart that are selling essential goods and services, and we're seeing pockets of ecommerce. So, I wanted to get a sense for what are you seeing within that vertical. And if you think you're withdrawing of guidance and one of the factors being uncertainty around the holiday shopping season. Is that a function of the impact from the fact that we're in a recession, it might take time for recovery. So, discretionary spending might be down or maybe some more detail around that? And then, the second question I wanted to ask, you talked a little bit about the payment terms and restructuring your deals. One of your competitors or peers talked about some customers deferring minimum traffic commitments in this environment. Just wanted to get a sense, is that something that you are seeing as well. Thanks. Ed McGowan : All right. So, I\u2019ll start with the second one. So, in terms of deferring minimum traffic commitments, we haven't got into that. As a matter of fact, traffic is up significantly. So, it hasn't been an issue for us. There are some customers in the Web division that have opted for the zero overage, but that's been a normal sales motion. So, I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't really call of anything there. On your question about retail and what we\u2019re worried about there. You're correct. There's winners and losers. Some folks have done very well and we\u2019ve seen traffic go higher, and their underlying businesses are doing well. But there's an awful lot of them that are stressed. And I talked about the size of the vertical, 16% of revenue over 900 customers. That's global. So, the really the big thing that we're concerned with and I think you hit it on the head with this, the depth of this reception and how do consumers behave, are they going to go out and spend, are they going to go back into stores, what's the ability of our customers to be able to raise enough capital to get through this issue. In some cases, we're going to see unfortunately some customers go bankrupt. I hate to see it, it does happen. Some liquidate, some come out on the other side. But whenever that happens, it's a disruption for us. We have to stop taking revenue, write-off revenue in the quarter, take a bad debt hit for some of the older receivables. So, it just becomes very disruptive. And it's hard for us to really call out what's going to happen, because I think what's going to drive the depth of this reception is going to be what happens with the virus and do people feel comfortable coming out, as we've never dealt with this before. So, it's really hard for us to make the call. And, just given the size of that vertical, it can swing around quite a bit. So, that's what our -- that's why we decided to withdraw our guidance. Rishi Jaluria : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lee Krowl with B. Riley. Lee Krowl : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. And congrats on a solid quarter, all things considered. I wanted to focus first on the security business. I think, last call, you guys kind of highlighted 20% growth as the baseline for the year. Obviously Q1 is tracking kind of ahead of that, and you're speaking to some momentum with bookings. Is it reasonable to say that that 20% or possibly higher is still reasonable? And then, second question, I just wanted to focus on international. Maybe could you parse out contribution of security versus media delivery, especially with the context of new launches on the OTT side? Thanks for taking my questions. Ed McGowan : Sure. So, I'll start with the security question. Obviously, we\u2019re off to a great start here. 28%, constant currency growth. Feeling pretty good about Q2. Obviously, Q1\u2019s bookings were strong. We signed one of our largest security deals in our in our history with one of our large media companies. So, good to see that and we see the benefit of that in Q2. So, I think Q2, we\u2019ll see really strong growth. And we did call out 20%. It's possible we could do better than that. Obviously, the verticals we call out that are challenged, do have big security customers. So, to the extent that there's bankruptcies and things like that can bump you around a little bit. But, feeling pretty good here in the first half., certainly that will be growing greater than 20%. And it's possible for the year, really just depends on how things go, some of the comments I made earlier. And your second question on international in terms of the strength, I\u2019d say, there it\u2019s similar to what we see in the U.S. probably a bit more security adoption, quite more greenfield internationally, especially in places like Latin America, pretty low penetration there, which is good. That\u2019s part of the reason we did the exceeded transaction that gives us a good basis to grow the security business there. We are seeing similar trends that we saw in the U.S. there where you see security and verticals like financial services and commerce and travel first and then you\u2019re seeing media start to catch up. We've done some pretty good deals on the media side as well. So, I'd say there's probably more greenfield in outside the U.S., but we are seeing very similar trends. Lee Krowl : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Jeff Van Rhee : Great, thanks. I think most might have been answered. Just one remaining. I think as you look at the enterprise sales effort, and this is a little outside of sort of the COVID environment currently, but I know long term, tremendous growth opportunity. When you look at the sales process and where you are at this point, can you just talk to your satisfaction with win rates, with process, with just the overall execution effort in sales within enterprise and things that are yet to be done to really get that running where you wanted, it if it isn\u2019t. Tom Leighton : Yes. We're pretty happy with where that is now, with pretty much everything you mentioned, the people, the process, the execution. As you could imagine, this is a difficult time to go out and get bookings. You can't physically meet with your accounts, the buyers out there, the IT folks are just swamped with adjusting to the new reality. And yet, we had a great bookings quarter, better than expectation on our enterprise security products, much -- big improvement over last year, and that's -- we're starting off the second quarter very well. So, I think that's an area where we're very happy. You don't see that in generating revenue today. But that will certainly help us going forward. Jeff Van Rhee : Got it. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Brandon Nispel : Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. I'm wondering if - one for Ed -- maybe both for Ed. Can you give us a sense of -- again, we've talked about some customers doing well in e-commerce, some not. Can you give us a sense of, as you look at your customer base, what could be a worst case scenario if we\u2019re going into the global recession throughout 2020? What percentage of revenue would be at risk? Second, I'm curious, with customers hitting increased traffic during the quarter, how does the pricing change? Is it dynamic during the quarter, where they hit sort of a new threshold for traffic and they reprice to a lower level? I'm just curious how that works. Thanks. Tom Leighton : Yes. I'll take the first and Ed will probably take the second. As Ed talked about, I think, barring some kind of deep and long lasting recession that wipes out major customers and a lot of them or just totally wipes out consumer buying, which of course hurts the commerce vertical, I think we're in good position. We have a really diverse customer base. Our largest vertical is media which is cranking and actually benefiting in many ways from the new reality of what the pandemic has caused. Our customer base tends to be the biggest names in the business. And generally speaking, they're the ones that are going to thrive the best, even if the global recession deepens and is lengthy. And it's just that I think no one really knows what the future holds through the global recession. And if it really is deep at the end of the year, and it's going persist into 2021, that could put our commerce customers and companies pretty much everywhere under pressure. And it's hard to really know what the impact of that could be. And that impacts the potential downside of any guidance we can give. And on the other side, we've got, as you know, substantial upsides in the media business and in security above where we were thinking. And as Ed talked about, just we want to be careful that we don't know for sure that just persists and grows from there all year long. And as Ed talked about, in June, he even -- we put in a dampening there in June on that. And so, that's really what's going on in our thinking that there's the potential for large upside and the potential for downsides that are hard for us to really quantify. And it's beyond our control at this point. I would say at a high level, business is very strong, as you can tell with the strong Q1 and I think a strong guide, albeit with a wider range in Q2. And Ed, do you want to talk about pricing with increased traffic? Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So, obviously, customers know one size fits all for customer pricing. But, what I would say is that typically we do have tiered pricing in most of our contracts, especially the ones with very large volume, so that as you do clip into new tiers, you do get typically a lower rate for that tier. But again, it does vary from customer-to-customer, but we do in most cases have some kind of a tiered pricing structure. Brandon Nispel : And I guess, just as a follow-up, you guys gave the travel hospitality exposure and sort of talked about live events, but could you give us what percentage of revenue is coming from what you would call SMB? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Oh, it's very small. Yes, we do very little with SMB. We have a couple of partners that work with SMB. Like, for example our carriers will sell some security offerings to small, medium business. It\u2019s such a small part of our business. We have a few OVP partners and other partners. But, it\u2019s not a significant part of our business at all. Tom Barth : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at several virtual investor conferences and events throughout the rest of the second quarter. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. I want to thank you for joining us. And all of us at Akamai wish you continued health, and I wish you a very nice evening. So, thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Akamai Technologies Q2 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Tom Barth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today\u2019s comments include forward-looking statements including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include uncertainty stemming from COVID-19 pandemic and any impact on unexpected geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai\u2019s filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company\u2019s view on July 28, 2020. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today\u2019s call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to report that Akamai achieved excellent results in the second quarter. Revenue was $795 million, up 13% year-over-year and up 14% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, up 3 points over Q2 of last year. And non-GAAP EPS was $1.38 per diluted share, up 29% year-over-year and up 30% in constant currency. These very strong results were driven by a continuation of the high traffic levels we\u2019ve seen since the onset of the pandemic, very strong demand for our Cloud Security Solutions and by our ongoing focus on operational efficiency. Akamai was founded with the vision of enabling the internet to scale, so that it could support millions of enterprises and billions of people everywhere. Our mission has been to make all digital experiences be fast, reliable, and secure, a mission that is especially important now amid a devastating pandemic. In our 22-year history as a company, there\u2019s never been a time when Akamai\u2019s importance and value to daily life has been more evident. Due to the incredible work of our highly talented employees, we believe that Akamai has become an indispensable part of the internet, supporting remote work, home entertainment, the learning online banking, home deliveries, logistics, security systems, and commercial transactions of all kinds, for billions of people around the world as they cope with a pandemic. The Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform has grown to include over 300,000 servers in over 4,000 locations and nearly 1,500 network partners at the edge of the internet. The edge is where the end users are and where the content and applications need to be. The edge is where connected devices and the internet of things are located where 5G networks will become pervasive and increasingly where security needs to be to stop the many distributed attacks whose size and sophistication continued to increase. 4,000 locations spanning 135 countries is a powerful offering for global customers and goes far beyond the deployments of other CDNs, even if you were to somehow put them all together. Our unique edge platform has provided enormous capacity to meet the unprecedented demand due to the impact of the pandemic, the launch of several OTT services and the release of numerous electronic games. Peak traffic on the Akamai platform exceeded 100 terabits per second every day in the second quarter. That\u2019s a lot of traffic. Of course, many CDNs claim to have lots of capacity, but none get close to Akamai when it comes to the actual delivery of content. As a result of our unparalleled scale and industry-leading performance and reliability, Akamai gained traffic share in Q2, on both an overall basis and at several of the world\u2019s largest media companies. Akamai now works with more than 220 of the world\u2019s largest OTT and broadcasting companies, as well as with 24 of the world\u2019s 25 most popular video game publishers. The enormous capacity of our unique edge platform has also enabled Akamai to defend the world\u2019s most important enterprises against the world\u2019s largest and most sophisticated attacks. The size and sophistication of attacks has risen dramatically since the pandemic began. As threat actors take advantage of the distraction and vulnerabilities created by employees working remotely. Data from our Enterprise Threat Protector service shows that employee visits to sites with malware rose nearly five-fold in Q2. And just last month we defended a major bank and a major internet service provider against two of the largest attacks ever seen. In Q2, we released our new and highly innovative Akamai Page Integrity Manager, which is designed to protect websites and end users from malware infected content that resides on third-party sites. Nearly half of the content on a typical website originates from third-parties and attackers are embedding malware in this content to steal user\u2019s credit cards and other personal data. Page Integrity Manager provides visibility and intelligence to help organizations stay ahead of this rapidly growing attack. And it has received strong positive feedback from early adopters. The well over 2000 customers who use our web application firewall products are perfect candidates for this new solution. Theft of login credentials is another growing problem that customers increasingly seek our help in stopping. We blocked more than 53 billion credential abuse attempts last quarter, more than four times the number we saw in Q2 of last year. This increase is one reason why our Bot Manager service is now used by more than 600 of the world\u2019s major enterprises. Overall, Q2 revenue from our Cloud Security Solutions grew by 28% year-over-year in constant currency and achieved $1 billion run rate on an annualized basis. This is an important milestone that\u2019s been reached by only a handful of cybersecurity businesses. Our Cloud Security Solutions are now relied upon by thousands of enterprises, including 30 of the world\u2019s top 35 banks, 17 of the world\u2019s top 20 e-commerce sites, 8 of the world\u2019s top 10 asset managers and the majority of the world\u2019s largest airlines, hotels, insurance firms, and consumer goods companies. The strong demand we saw in Q2 for our security and media services, more than offset the reduced revenue growth we saw from sectors of the economy that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, namely travel, hospitality [Technical Difficulty] by the pandemic. That\u2019s one of many reasons why Akamai customer loyalty has remained very high and that our churn rate in the quarter stayed below 1% of annualized revenue. As we\u2019ve grown our business over the last several years, we\u2019ve worked hard to improve our operating efficiency and profitability. As a result, we were especially pleased to see our operating margins exceed our target of 30% in Q2. And also to see our non-GAAP earnings per share reach a $1.38 more than double what we achieved three years ago. Our profitability and cash generation is important, because it gives us the financial fire power to continue to invest in innovation, network capacity, go-to-market capabilities and world-class talent to fuel our future growth. Before turning the call over to Ed, I want to thank our nearly 8,000 employees for their very hard work on behalf of our many customers and the billions of internet users around the world. Despite the pandemic, Akamai employees have continued their can do attitude and customer first mindset, enabling our platform to manage more traffic, more web transactions and more cyber attacks than ever before. Their creativity, teamwork, and tenacity are key to what makes Akamai such a unique and strong company. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed for more on Q2 and our outlook for the second half. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. Today, I plan to review our exceptional Q2 results, discuss the impact COVID-19 is having on our business and provide guidance for Q3 and the full year. As Tom mentioned, we delivered a great quarter on both the top and bottom line. Q2 revenue was $795 million, up 13% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency, driven by extremely robust traffic growth in media, and another quarter of very strong results from our Cloud Security Solutions. Revenue from our Media and Carrier Division was $390 million, up 19% year-over-year and 20% in constant currency. The outstanding performance of our Media and Carrier Division was a result of very strong traffic growth in OTT video, gaming and software downloads. This was a continuation of elevated traffic we saw in late March as shelter-in-place orders were issued in most countries around the world. Revenue from our Internet Platform Customers was $51 million, up 10% over Q2 of last year. Revenue from our Web Division was $404 million, up 7% year-over-year and 8% in constant currency. Revenue growth from web customers was driven once again by security. Revenue from our Cloud Security Solutions totaled $259 million, up 27% year-over-year and 28% in constant currency. Cloud security revenue represented 33% of total revenue in the quarter, compared to 29% in the same quarter a year ago. It is worth noting that approximately $7 million of security revenue in Q2 came from one-time license sales to several carrier customers. And we do not expect to see licensed sales at this level in Q3. Moving on to revenue by geography. International revenue was $351 million, up 22% year-over-year or 25% in constant currency. We are very pleased with our strong international performance, especially in APJ and Latin America. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative $1 million impact to revenue on a sequential basis and had a negative $8 million impact on a year-over-year basis. Sales in our international markets represented 44% of total revenue in Q2, up 3 points from Q2 2019 and consistent with Q1 levels. Revenue from our U.S. market was $444 million, up 6% year-over-year. Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 77% consistent with Q1 levels. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 65%, also consistent with Q1 levels. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $253 million in line with expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $355 million, up $29 million from Q1 and up $63 million or 21% from Q2 2019. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45%, up 2 points from Q1 and up 3 points from Q2 2019. Non-GAAP operating income was $258 million, up $29 million from Q1 levels and up $54 million or 26% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, up 2 points from Q1 levels and up 3 points from Q2 of last year. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest, were $196 million in line with our guidance range as we began to catch up on supply chain and travel disruptions that impacted our network build out in Q1. Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $162 million or $0.98 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $227 million or $1.38 of earnings per diluted share, up 29% year-over-year, up 30% in constant currency and $0.14 above the high end of our guidance range. As Q2 results really demonstrated the leverage of our platform and operating model. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $38 million based on a Q2 effective tax rate of approximately 14%. Now I\u2019ll turn to some balance sheet items. We continue to believe that our balance sheet is very strong. As of June 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.4 billion. During the second quarter, we spent $27 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 300,000 shares. We have approximately $658 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. We plan to continue to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution resulting from equity compensation over time. In summary, we\u2019re very pleased with our performance in the second quarter. And before I turn to our Q3 and full year guidance, I wanted to provide you an update on some of the things I discussed last quarter regarding COVID-19. On our last call, I shared with you details about web verticals that were most impacted by the pandemic during the first quarter, specifically, travel and hospitality and commerce and retail. As you would expect, our customers within the travel and hospitality vertical continue to be challenged in Q2. And although some retail customers experienced notable increases in e-commerce activity, the uptick was tempered in some cases by bankruptcy and continued disruption to those customers that have a heavier reliance on brick and mortar. Many global brands in both of these verticals rely heavily on Akamai. We plan to continue to work closely with them as they cope with near-term financial pressures and look beyond into a post COVID-19 world. As a result, Q2 was negatively impacted by approximately $14 million related to a combination of contract restructurings and elevated bad debt reserves. This impact was in line with our expectations. I\u2019d now like to provide our outlook for Q3 and for full year 2020. For Q3, we are projecting revenue in the range of $760 million to $785 million for up 7% to 11% in constant currency over Q3 2019. The sequential decline in revenue embedded in our Q3 guidance reflects three items. First, we expect the recent actions taken in India to band 59. Chinese based web applications will negatively impact Q3 revenue by approximately $15 million sequentially. We deliver traffic for approximately 30 of those applications in the second quarter. Our guidance assumes the ban will remain in place for the balance of 2020. Second, we expect to see our typical seasonal summer traffic moderation, because people begin to spend more time outside in a way from their devices. And third, we expect internet platform customer revenue to decline by approximately $4 million to $5 million in Q3, primarily due to two of our largest platform customers renewing at new pricing levels in June. At current spot rates, foreign exchange is expected to have a positive $6 million impact on Q3 revenue compared to Q2 levels and no impact on a year-over-year basis. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $249 million to $260 million up slightly from Q2 levels. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided. We anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins of approximately 43%. Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $99 million to $101 million. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% for Q3. Moving on to CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $193 million to $203 million, excluding equity compensation in the third quarter. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration, I just outlined, we expect Q3 three non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.20 to $1.24 or up 8% to 12% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of approximately $34 million to $35 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 15%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. Moving onto annual guidance, with increased visibility to Q3 and the remainder of the year, I\u2019m very pleased to reinstate guidance for the full year 2020. While, our ranges are a bit wider than usual, we want it to be as transparent as possible about how we see the remainder of the year shaping up. We currently expect revenue of $3.125 billion to $3.175 billion, which assumes our security business contributes more than $1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 43%. Non-GAAP operating margins of 30% to 31%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $50.2 to $5.12. This represents year-over-year growth of 12% to 14%. This non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 15% and the fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. Finally, full year CapEx is expected to be 22% to 23% of revenue. In summary, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our business. We believe our excellent Q2 results demonstrated the profitability of our business model and scalability of our platform, our revenue diversification, deep enterprise customer relationships in our strong balance sheet and cash flow. Thank you. Tom. And I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Breen of William Blair. Your line is open. James Breen : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. There\u2019s a couple on the customer side, you talked about a couple of renewals this quarter. Can you just give us a little bit of color into how those contracts work going forward and/or is there any other anticipated renewals in the back half of the year. And then just commentary around the security side, obviously, it\u2019s a large business and continue to see you continue to grow in the high 20% range. I think a lot of us have anticipated something in the lower 20% of the beginning of the year. So can you just talk about some of the products there, maybe some of the new products that are driving it and then just give a little more color on the overall picture? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Hey, Jim. This is Ed. I\u2019ll take the first one and then Tom, you can take the second one. So in terms of the renewals, in terms of major renewals for the back half of the year, I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t expect anything large for the internet platform customers. There will be no more renewals this year and in terms of the contracts pretty standard. The good news, I guess, is a couple of them are no longer term in nature, but not all of the \u2013 we will have some renewals next year, but very pleased with how those contracts turned out. Tom? Tom Leighton : Yes. The revenue and security was driven by our flagship services, Kona Site Defender, which provides web application firewall capabilities, stops the attackers from taking over a website or corrupting it or stealing data. There are [indiscernible] service capabilities. That stops the big attacks. You have Bot Manager doing extremely well. And that keeps adversaries from taking over accounts from stealing customer information. We also have a very strong security services business, and those folks have been very busy, as you can imagine, with major IT shops now trying to support, remote work and work from home on a sudden basis, where they really need security help. Closely related, but a smaller business is our Enterprise Security offerings. And we do have new capabilities there. We now have a Secure Web Gateway that\u2019s available. And coming up later this year, multifactor authentication. We also have a new service I talked about called Page Integrity Manager. And this works the \u2013 one of the latest attack vectors that\u2019s becoming pretty rampant out there where the adversary puts malware into a third-party side or third-party code that\u2019s used by the primary site. And what happens there is the user comes to the main site and the main site links to third parties for their apps and other things that are useful, usually. And the browser follows those links. And before you know what the browser is getting malware from one of those third-party sites. And that malware is designed to cause the browser to give up the user\u2019s personal information like their credit card. There are some very famous breaches there resulting in large fines and Page Integrity Manager stops that and notifies our customer that they got a problem in terms of where they\u2019re linking for their third-party content. Also we have Akamai Identity Cloud, which provides capabilities around the user and their profile and history, making sure that user data stays safe and compliant with local regulations. So really a lot going on in our security business, and we\u2019re seeing very strong growth there, obviously. James Breen : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much and congrats on all the success. Tom, I wanted to ask you about the Edge Computing opportunity. There\u2019s a lot of buzz out there around the Edge and what some are the use \u2013 I\u2019d be curious to hear just from you, what are some of the use cases that convince you it\u2019s very real? Over what time line does it materialize? And how is Akamai positioned to win in capturing this? Tom Leighton : Yes. We\u2019re the largest provider of edge computing services by far. We have been doing it for close to 20 years. And the idea that this is how somehow something new is just not true. It\u2019s \u2013 most of our customers are using our edge computing capabilities for a variety of applications to A, B testing for how users like their site, to do things locally about what content actually gets delivered to the user, what ads get delivered to the user. Keeping track of how a user goes through a site. The security services use an extensive compute power at the Edge. We don\u2019t break it out as a separate revenue item, but if you use the definitions, we see that a lot of folks in the analyst community are using, I would say already, it\u2019s over a $2 billion business for us. We don\u2019t report it that way. But most of our customers are using the computing in some form or another, and also when it comes to Edge, I think this is really important. We\u2019ve been talking about the Edge and the importance of being at the Edge really again, 20 years, and recently it\u2019s become popular as a buzzword. And that\u2019s because the Edge is really important, but to be at the Edge, that means you got to be in thousands of places, close to the users, really close, and we\u2019re in 4,000 points of presence now. A lot of the other CDNs, who talk about doing Edge or Edge Computing, maybe they\u2019re in a couple of dozen cloud core data centers, which is really not the Edge. In fact, you could take probably about maybe even all of our CDN competitors put them together and they don\u2019t get anywhere close to the Edge presence that Akamai has. And what\u2019s the future of Edge Computing, I think it\u2019s very large, you look at 5G coming and that\u2019s going to utilize a lot of capabilities at the Edge. With 5G, you get a lot more devices connected. IoT becomes much more possible. You have much lower latencies in the last mile. And then that means it\u2019s even more important to do the computer delivery from the last mile. If you\u2019ve got a huge latency in the last mile, okay, the latency you\u2019ve introduced going from the Edge of the core is not as bad, but you really now it becomes noticeable with 5G. Also you have a lot more bandwidth to 5G. So I think that\u2019s an important driver, a future revenue for Akamai. Also with IoT, we already have an IoT Edge Connect platform that our customers are using. It\u2019s unique among CDNs. It uses different protocols. Not ACTP, by and large, which is what powers a lot of the web today, but MQTT, it uses the pub sub model, which is a whole different communication paradigm. That\u2019s a lot more efficient. And again, users not only compute at the Edge, but data stored at edge, key value pairs and databases at the Edge. And Akamai is in an unique position to provide that. But again, I just want to be really clear Edge Computing is not a new phenomenon. It\u2019s got recent buzz with a couple of IPOs on the street, but we\u2019ve been doing that at scale for a long, long time. Brad Zelnick : Thank you so much, Tom. That\u2019s it for me and congrats again. Tom Leighton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. So, Ed, you kind of give us a couple of the parameters that will impact Q3, but as I think about the full year guidance, how have you layered in perhaps some of the positive impacts that we would see from a more full rollout of some of the new OTT solutions, as well as the presidential election? Ed McGowan : Hey, Sterling, thanks for the question. So I\u2019ll start with the presidential election. I\u2019d say, this year \u2013 coming into the year, we\u2019re expecting probably a bit more robust debate scheduled, where a lot of competitors going out to the democratic seat that sort of ended quickly. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably going to be a bit more muted this year. Just because there \u2013 I think there\u2019s only three debates scheduled, it\u2019s not as much activity as I would have expected at this time. So nothing outside of a little bit of revenue associated with that. So nothing really significant. On the OTT launches, obviously, we just had one go a couple of weeks ago. It\u2019s still early days and I don\u2019t want to go in May. So still pretty early there. I think we\u2019ve got, you saw the media revenue, obviously, very, very strong expect to see another strong quarter. Despite the fact that I talked a bit about the dynamics in Q3 and for the rest of the year with those applications in India being banned. But we\u2019re seeing good growth there and expect that to continue into the balance of the year. Sterling Auty : All right, great. And then one follow-up. How should we think about the contract restructurings, and maybe in particular, excuse me, into the e-commerce vertical in the back half of the year, maybe in light of a question that I\u2019m getting a lot right now is, probably not a lot of foot traffic going to the malls. Could we be setup for just a massive e-commerce holiday season this year and traditionally that\u2019s been a big benefit for Akamai. Ed McGowan : Yes. Good question. So you can imagine, there\u2019s an awful lot of debate internally on that. What I would say with contract restructurings, I mentioned, that we had about a $14 million a headwind here in Q2. Most of that was in travel, retail we did see about 10 bankruptcies roughly this quarter. And you look at the economic data, it\u2019s mixed, there are some, some numbers that are doing better than others. So as we go and look at the Q4, you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve given quite a wide range, and if you do some math on kind of the mid points, it\u2019s kind of suggests a bit softer than we saw last year. Maybe we go to the high end, it could be a bit better, but it\u2019s still tougher to call. I will say, when I talked about the web vertical or web division, excuse me, last quarter, I expected it to be flat to down a bit, probably a little bit better than I expected in Q2, mainly because we\u2019ve seen a lot of our customers, both in retail and travel be able to access the capital markets and stabilize their businesses a bit. But I still think it\u2019s going to be pretty rocky going into Q4 as we get into the fall season, who knows what happens with the pandemic. But the thesis is correct. There\u2019s not a lot of people going to the stores, you could see a lot of online retail activity. We see a bit of a, kind of a mixed bag. We see some that are doing much better than expected, in terms of traffic growth and others that are kind of in line. And you\u2019ve got some that are still struggling with just their legacy business and in financial difficulty. So we\u2019ll see, but that\u2019s why we provided a wide range. There\u2019s a couple of different ways, different outcomes that could happen here in Q4. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. Two questions if I may. I guess, for Ed, I just wanted to follow-up on Jim\u2019s question, regarding security. And Tom, appreciate the various sub-segments that you broke out. Can you help us just a bucket from a revenue perspective, some of the bigger drivers maybe either in dollars or percentage as we start to focus more on that security business. I think it\u2019d be helpful just to give it more color on where the revenue is actually coming from. And then secondly, you guys haven\u2019t really done any tuck in M&A in some time. Is that just a function of a disconnect with valuations? Or is it something else and trying to get a sense, if we should expect to see that kind of start to come back into the full, maybe the next few quarters. Thank you. Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So as far as security goes, I think it\u2019s a bit more of the same. We saw good strength with Kona Site Defender, that\u2019s obviously our largest product and drives the most revenue. We\u2019re starting to see a nice uptick in Prolexic. That was a good surprise for the quarter. Bot Man continues to be probably our fastest growing product. Security services are going along pretty well. So it\u2019s really sort of strength across the board. And I think as I look into the future, Tom talked a bit about Page Integrity. That\u2019s the product that we\u2019re really excited about. When you think about the KSD base as really good customer base to go and upsell that. We\u2019re hoping that, that has very similar characteristics of Bot Man, which is a nice addition on to Kona Site Defender. And Bot Man got to 100 million pretty quickly. Hopefully we can see the same with Page Integrity. Colby Synesael : Does Kona, for example, 50% of revenue, is it 60% of revenue of the security business, any color there? Ed McGowan : So we haven\u2019t broken it out yet. I\u2019d say it is the largest percentage. We\u2019ve got four products over 100 million. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s over 50%, but it\u2019s probably close to that. That\u2019s a reasonable for proxy. Tom Leighton : And on the M&A question, we\u2019re continuing our efforts there, at the same pace is always. But we\u2019re also very disciplined buyers. And when you\u2019re in the midst of a pandemic, it is a little harder to conduct diligence. And if we were to close an acquisition, maybe a little harder to integrate it with the travel restrictions we have now. So probably that\u2019s a damper. And I wouldn\u2019t say, there\u2019s huge bargains that have been created as a result of the pandemic, at least not yet. And we\u2019re very careful about what we buy to make sure it makes good financial sense, but we\u2019re continuing with our efforts there full speed ahead. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Josh Baer : Hi, this is Josh Baer on for Keith. Just wondering, if there\u2019s any way to quantify the benefit to OpEx in Q2 and maybe in Q3 from more limited travel, entertainment and expenses related to COVID. And then more broadly, as it relates to margins, how should investors think about margin expansion in the years to come beyond the 30% to 31% for this year? Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. I\u2019ll take the first part and say a few words on the second part. Maybe Tom, you can chime in on that as well. In terms of the travel, it\u2019s not a huge expenditure for us, using a couple million dollars a month. So we did see obviously a lot less travel this quarter. And we\u2019ll see a little bit in Q3. So not a huge amount of savings there, but that did help operating margins. I think what really benefited the operating margin line was, obviously, extremely strong traffic, running the network at, probably hotter than we\u2019d like. That\u2019s why you see us building out a lot more CapEx. The network performed fantastically well, but you do want to make sure that you\u2019ve got a lot more capacity to be able to handle big spikes and take advantage of opportunities when other competitors may have some struggles and it\u2019s good to have that extra capacity. But when you do run the network, how do you see the drop to the operating line. In terms of margins, we\u2019ve said in the past that we plan on operating at 30%, we want to continue to make investments in the business. We added a couple of hundred heads this quarter, and in the areas of research and development product and go to market, we think there\u2019s still a lot of room for growth here. So we want to make sure we balance that appropriately. Josh Baer : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Fish of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. James Fish : Well, and appreciate the added color this quarter. I just have one, it\u2019s on web proxy. It\u2019s been in beta and been freely available to some customers out there, given your goodwill. Why not accelerate the modernization of the product and accelerate the investments and enterprise security to really step on the gas on a high profile area? Tom Leighton : Well, yes, we are working very hard in terms of both product delivery and with a sales effort. And we were very pleased to see substantially increased bookings so far this year. And we very much would like to continue to accelerate the penetration in that business. James Fish : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Will Power of Baird. Your line is open. Will Power : Great. Thanks. Let me \u2013 a couple of questions very quickly \u2013 here. I wonder if you could just comment broadly on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of enterprise sales cycles, broader pipeline, are you continuously benefits from COVID. Or are you starting to see any potential headwinds economic pressures. And then my second question, just coming back to the media, is there any way to kind of help break apart the sources of upside there, obviously, really strong results. Any particular outliers between video, gaming, et cetera? Tom Leighton : Yes, this is Tom. I\u2019ll take the first question. I would say, it\u2019s a mixed bag with COVID. On the one hand, there is a much greater need for our security products, not just enterprise products with remote workforces, but pretty much all the security products because the attack volumes and vectors have increased so much with the threat actors trying to take advantage of the situation. So that\u2019s a good tailwind. And I think you saw the benefit of that so far this year. On the other hand, sales are a little harder, because you can\u2019t visit customers. Everything is remote now. That said, I think our teams have done a very good job adapting with virtual conferences and meetings. And so I think we\u2019re dealing with that situation very well. On balance, I think we\u2019re in a much stronger position with our security offers, in terms of the customer\u2019s need for our products. And I think Ed will take the question on media upside. Ed McGowan : Yes. So the good news is, it was really strength across a number of areas. I\u2019ll dig into a couple for you. I would say one area in particular that stands out in my mind is gaming. We saw a ton of gaming activity and so a lot of major publishers do some smart things, including running some promotions to promote their games and offer attractive incentives for folks to leverage their portfolio. During the time that you\u2019ve got people locked up in a pandemic. So we saw not only just a more robust game release quarter, we just saw some really smart things by the game publishers and that drove a tremendous amount of traffic. So that was an area of particular strength. And then obviously no surprise video, OTT video from a lot of the existing providers, some of the newer providers added as well. And that was strength pretty much across the board. It was both here in the U.S. and internationally. Our internet platforms obviously provided some nice upside for the quarter. That\u2019s been a theme we\u2019ve talked about a lot, they\u2019ve kind of been in that stabilization in the $45 million range. And every once in a while, we get some upside from those customers as well. And then also social media. We saw \u2013 we carry a number of social media platforms and it\u2019s not much of a surprise that people are locked up in their homes and not traveling and going out to dinner and things like that spending more time online, including social media. So the good news is pretty much across the game, but if I had to point out one thing in particular that jumped out will be gaming. Will Power : Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caroline Liu : Hi. This is Caroline on for Heather. And thank you for taking my question. My first one is really just on the security business. I was wondering if you could give more color on what is the split between new business from the existing customers versus like a completely new Akamai customers. And then if you are a new to Akamai, is there an opportunity to set upsell a CDN and other products to that security customer. And then I just have a quick follow-up. Ed McGowan : Sure. No problem. So obviously, our business being a recurring revenue business, you don\u2019t get a ton of revenue right off of that, when you sign up a new customer. So the majority of the business does come from our existing customer base right now about 59% of our customers buy a security product, which is up couple of points from last quarter. And then about 31% of our customer base is buying more than one security product. So that\u2019s going to be a theme in terms of future growth that, whether it\u2019s your ad, you buy Kona Site Defender, you\u2019re adding Page Integrity or Bot Management or Security Services. So I\u2019d say for the certainly for the near-term seeing most of our growth coming from our existing customers is where we\u2019re going to see the majority of the growth is that customers take on more security products. And then as far as when you sign up as a new customer, we do tend to sell a lot of protect and perform bundle, so it\u2019s not unusual to see somebody come in as both a security customer and as a CDN customer, but throughout our history, if you look at our strategy has always been to focus on the largest web properties, largest banks, largest travel, retail customers, et cetera. And to grow those accounts over time. We talk about how we\u2019ve worked with some of our customers that have been challenged with COVID and restructuring contracts and offering some financial assistance that will pay off in the long run. And that\u2019s always been our strategy. So our focus on acquiring new customers that have a lot of growth opportunity, this has paid off over the last 20 years. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to continue to focus. Caroline Liu : Got it. And then \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Ed McGowan : I said you had a second question. Caroline Liu : Yes. So the other one is just on OTT, you talked about how you\u2019re continuing to drive share gains. And last quarter, I remember you also said that as well. So I\u2019m kind of curious, like what exactly is, kind of enabling you guys to gain more share in traffic. Is there something on the competitors? Or is it more so your guys is doing the product innovation side. Ed McGowan : Yeah. I\u2019d say there\u2019s probably three key areas. The first one is around performance. So what a lot of the OTT providers or really any large scale media customer will do is they\u2019ll have their own set of performance metrics. And pretty much now most large providers of media content will split with CDNs. And usually it\u2019s the one with the best quality wins. Pricing is pretty efficient in the market. So it\u2019s not as much about price anymore. Occasionally, you\u2019ll see that, but it\u2019s really about performance. That\u2019s the one thing. I\u2019d say the other thing is around the capacity that you have outside of the U.S. in particular, we tend to do much better in places that are harder to deliver. And then I say the last thing is just having, scale is another area that depending on the type of application, you can see, real big peak demands, whether that\u2019s in gaming or live sporting events and such like that. So having capacity in the right places, the best performance and having the scale is really what drives the share gains. Caroline Liu : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question, guys. I have a two as well. First off, I guess when I think about the revenue performance this quarter on the CDN side, especially. I\u2019m curious, did you see a normal drop-off in usage patterns in the month of June, the summer season kicked off. I\u2019m asking that broadly, because given the fact that shelter in place remains broadly across the globe. Do you think that Q3 could not see a seasonal drop, because we\u2019re all limited and not able to travel at this point? Tom Leighton : Yes. So you do start to see a little bit of traffic, not accelerating as much, I would say, probably the best way to put it. Coming into the pandemic, something like that really accelerates a trend. So you saw a lot more internet users now adopting e-commerce, adopting \u2013 watching video online, cord cutting, et cetera. So we saw a nice bump from COVID in the pandemic, and we\u2019ve seen that sustained. I\u2019d say traffic was elevated probably longer than we had expected. We\u2019ve never been through one of these, so it\u2019s hard to always call it. But in terms of normal seasonality, I would expect to see, as the summer months come on, we do expect to see traffic certainly not grow as quickly as we saw the last quarter, but it\u2019ll still be strong. But I would expect some seasonality that\u2019s reflected in our guide. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then if I can just follow-up, how do we think about the security business performing in the back half of the year relative to the top line expectations you\u2019ve given, especially some of the commentary you just had on the new customer part of the equation over here? Tom Leighton : Yes, sure. So one thing I did call out on the call was that we had some license revenue. We do sell every quarter a couple million dollars of license, some of our Nominum products to our carrier business \u2013 our target customers, excuse me. And this quarter, in particular, was a bit unusual, just that we had that sort of performance. I talked about $7 million in the quarter. Typically, you see that purchase behavior in the back half of the year in Q4. It\u2019s a little bit unusual to see that in Q2 or Q3. So I just wanted to call that out. It\u2019s something we want to take into consideration. And also, as you look at sort of year-over-year growth rates, Q4 of last year, we had a massive sequential growth quarter-over-quarter. I think we were up about $22 million sequentially. So just kind of keep that in mind as you\u2019re doing your modeling, think about kind of your year-over-year growth. We talked about being over $1 billion. At the beginning of the year when we gave guidance, we talked about doing $1 billion of revenue in security. So this implies sort of low 20% growth rate, which is better than we had expected coming into the year. And then again, as far as new customers are concerned, you\u2019ve got a base this big. The revenue growth is going to come from that existing customer base. We continue to add new customers every quarter, but it won\u2019t make a material impact on the year. That happens over time. So it\u2019s \u2013 we continue to add customers over time, it will be more of an impact on the overall growth, but it\u2019s going to be the existing customers that really drive the growth. Amit Daryanani : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Okay, thanks. Two questions, then. Sports has been, I guess, a non-event. What are you assuming? What is a reasonable assumption for what kind of traffic you could get from sports? And I guess you\u2019ve had such strong traffic the last couple of months because we\u2019ve all been at home but without sports. And so as sports, hopefully, it comes back and MLB, NHL, et cetera, how material could that be like what if we just learned over the last couple of months, you can have really strong traffic growth without any sports at all? And then the other thing I wanted to ask is you talked about these apps banned in India. One of those apps could be banned in the U.S. Would that be a similarly material event for you if that app were to be banned in the U.S.? Thank you. Ed McGowan : Hey Mark, yes, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll take the second one first, and I\u2019ll talk about sports right after. So the way to think about U.S., if the U.S. were to do something very similar to what happened in India, the number of Internet users in India is much greater than the U.S., it\u2019s about 3 times the overall population. So you\u2019ll have fewer users, assuming kind of like-for-like. And then also, we tend to have a bit more competition in the U.S. We tend to get outsized share in India. So I would not expect it to be as material. It would be an impact we do for those 30 apps that I talked about. We deliver traffic here in the U.S., but it would not be as material. In terms of sports, so yes, you\u2019re right. We really haven\u2019t had much sports. We had a little bit of the premier league in the Bundesliga over in Europe. One thing I was looking for was to see \u2013 where we see a much different traffic profile now that you don\u2019t have spans in the stands? And while we have a limited subset, we get a couple of weeks now of major \u2013 a week of Major League Baseball and a couple of soccer leagues. We haven\u2019t seen anything that suggests that the traffic patterns are materially different. I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably more normal and in line with what I would normally expect. So still early, we\u2019ve got the NHL, NBA kicking off here at the end of the week. And then hopefully, the NFL coming on and Champions League and IPL and a bunch of other things. Now, I talked in the last call that for us, sports in general, is about a little over 1% of our revenue. Now if you get that all in a concentrated period of time, that could add some decent revenue. Still, like I said, early days to see how the behavior changes. I\u2019ve watched a number of baseball games and seeing it without fans is not as exciting personally. But hopefully, it continues to drive a lot of folks to watch online. But I think about it in that sort of perspective, about over the course of a year, a little over 1% of revenue comes from live sports. Certainly, the bigger ones being NFL, Champions League, IPL, some of the other sports, not quite as big. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks a lot, Ed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Tim Horan : Thanks, guys. Tom, back to the Edge. In the past, I think you were a little skeptical about being able to do kind of gaming as a cloud service just because of the cost of the compute and the latency. Maybe just any more updates on what you\u2019re seeing from that perspective. And maybe any other applications that you think are perfect for your infrastructure that\u2019s already in place that are new or more Edge based. Tom Leighton : Yes. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any change in the gaming landscape, if anything. I think the thesis that it is less efficient to do all the compute in the cloud probably getting proved out. Companies have been working on that for over a decade. Now we do a lot of business with the gaming companies. So we\u2019re a go-to player for them to distribute software. And there are things that we can do to optimize the performance as well. But I think doing all the compute in the cloud, it\u2019s not as efficient, just economically. With Edge Computing applications, pretty much all of our customers\u2019 applications that run on Akamai are doing some kinds of compute, personalization, the selection of the content that goes to the end user, the format it goes in, the images, which image goes, depends on the device, the connectivity in the last mile, all optimized for performance. So it\u2019s pervasive today, I would say, Edge Computing on our platform, which is a reason why we don\u2019t separate it out. I don\u2019t think you can. And also on the Security side, we are inspecting the details of every single request that comes in and also the content that goes back out. We\u2019re placing software on the client for all sorts of purposes, most recently for Page Integrity Manager. As you go to a website that\u2019s protected by Page Integrity Manager, we have our script on the client itself that is looking at everything the browser is being asked to do, to see \u2013 for example, is it being asked to access your credit card or stuff that we believe is personal information and send it to a place that we think is bad. And I can\u2019t tell you how much we\u2019ve already discovered is going on out there. So I would say Edge Computing is just pervasive today. And the Edge being our edge servers in 4,000 locations, which is the real edge. And also on the client, we\u2019re doing a lot of computing there as well. And I do think that is the future. And as you have richer applications, there\u2019s more use of that. I think the big opportunity going forward is in the IoT arena. I think 5G helps to enable that. And as I mentioned before, that\u2019s a whole different paradigm, uses different protocols and different structures like the pub-sub model and data stores. And again, being at the Edge helps a lot to reduce the latencies there. Edge Computing is not a new phenomenon. And I think that\u2019s really important to understand. Tim Horan : And just a quick follow-up on security. Ed, I\u2019m assuming the vast, vast majority of Security revenue is kind of recurring or not usage based, but just any clarification there. And can you give us some color, how does it compare to your gross margins of Security versus your consolidated gross margins? Thank you. Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So I\u2019d say the majority is recurring. There is \u2013 as I talked about, we do some bundling. So you have a bundle of Protect and Perform. So that can drive a little bit of variability in usage. Sometimes you see that kind of play out in Q4 to Q1, but the majority is recurring in nature. And then your second question was on gross margins. Yes. So the gross margin on security would be greater than what you would typically see on CDN. And it\u2019s an interesting debate, right, because you\u2019re using the same servers that are delivering a video to one home might be blocking an attack from another home. And it just kind of shows the power of the model and the leverage that we have that as we build out this Edge, we can build on new capabilities on top. And those incremental capabilities have much higher incremental gross margin and Security certainly falls into that category. Tim Horan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Hannah Rudoff : Hi guys, this is Hannah Rudoff on for Rishi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me here. Could you talk about how your customer conversations, especially around Enterprise Security Solutions have shifted from when you last talked about three months ago, especially organizations have maybe moved out of triage mode at this point and are thinking more about medium and long-term planning? Tom Leighton : Yes. I think at a high level, the conversations are very similar. But with much more urgency in some cases, I can just give you an anecdote with a conversation with a CEO of a very large company. And the CEO was both happy and worried about how quickly his IT team had enabled the workforce to be remote. And he was happy because within a week, the entire workforce was remote because basically a shelter in place rules are put in place. On the other hand, he was worried because he always wanted a remote workforce, but was always told by his Chief Security Officer it would take two years to make it be secure. And all of a sudden, their workforce is remote in a week. And that led to a really good conversation about, okay, how can we really secure it for them. And that\u2019s where our Enterprise Application Access product and our Zero Trust suite of solutions really makes a big difference. It\u2019s a service on our platform. It does it security at the application layer, not at the network layer. So never mind the pandemic and remote work, it\u2019s just a lot more secure to start with. But now you\u2019re in a position where very quickly we can enable them to have security for a remote workforce that employees can only access apps that they\u2019re allowed to. And even then, the employee device can\u2019t directly touch the app or the data, it just touches us. And we\u2019re scouring every communication to make sure that malware isn\u2019t being spread and data is not being exfiltrated. And of course, that\u2019s not possible with the traditional approach. So I think the COVID situation with remote work has certainly enhanced the interest in EAA. The attack rising in general have enhanced interest in Akamai Security Solutions. And of course, you\u2019re right that there\u2019s a lot of scrambling going on out there. And so it is a little more complicated in terms of the sales process. But on balance, I would say we\u2019re doing better than we expected. And on balance, there\u2019s more tailwinds associated with the pandemic for our business because customers need our help even more than before. Hannah Rudoff : Great, super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lee Krowl of B. Riley FBR. Your line is open. Lee Krowl : Great. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on a very solid quarter. Two questions. First, on the impact of the Indian app ban. You quantified the impact, a little bit more detail. I\u2019m curious if that makes an assumption for a backfill from apps that are still available to consumers as an offset? Or is that just a complete loss of business? And then secondly, can you just maybe talk about CapEx leverage? I assume as we start to lap some of these OTT launches from a year-over-year perspective, is there an ability to see leverage now that you\u2019ve built in some of the capacity? Or is there a working assumption that as we continue to see proliferation of these products, that CapEx will need to kind of match the growth in traffic? Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So in terms of the India ban, we assume that there\u2019s a complete loss there. Obviously, there\u2019s \u2013 users move to other applications to the extent that there\u2019s other options in the market. We\u2019re obviously having conversations with all those customers. In some cases, we were \u2013 some of them are customers now, some of them we\u2019re trying to acquire. So yes, we\u2019re just assuming that there\u2019s really no material impact right now just because it\u2019s an unknown. We haven\u2019t seen any major shift or anything like that. That\u2019s just sort of traffic has disappeared for lack of a better term. This is something we\u2019ve never dealt with before. So we\u2019re kind of in unchartered territory. So what we did is just wanted to call it out for you guys. And so you could think about it in your models because, obviously, while the Q2 guidance is very, very strong and above where the consensus was, it is a step down, and that is a material reason why. Obviously, if that traffic comes back, that would be great. I wouldn\u2019t expect it to all come back at once. I think it\u2019d be some kind of a ramp. But to the extent that other players in the market pick up some of this behavior or some of the various things that folks are doing with those apps, we\u2019re going to be right there trying to acquire those customers. And with our scale and capacity and performance, we should be in great shape to get it. But there\u2019s no assumption that there\u2019s a shift from one to another. As far as CapEx goes, this quarter should be the high watermark for the year. Obviously, we weren\u2019t expecting a pandemic starting off the year. Or Tom had mentioned doing 100 terabits every day of the quarter. Obviously, it came with a lot more revenue. So what we\u2019re doing now is just kind of retooling and building up more capacity just in anticipation that there could be a second wave of COVID here and maybe another big splice. We want to be prepared for that. In our capacity planning, we\u2019re going to assume that, that traffic comes back in India. We\u2019re not making the assumption here on the revenue side. If we\u2019re wrong, we\u2019ll grow into it. But as I think about sort of a normal CapEx range, the network CapEx is really wide focused on. I know you kind of look at that headline number and I sort of look at the software cap being in sort of that 7% to 8% range. We have got a full gross expense in the P&L for R&D. So R&D running at 13%, 14% of revenue is about the right way to look at it. I think that\u2019s a healthy spend. And then if you look at network CapEx in the 7% to 10% range, it\u2019s kind of a normal range with this year, obviously, being closer to 14% because of the pandemic. I think this is probably the right way to think about it, to the extent that we see the opportunity for significant growth or accelerated core cutting or whatever. We\u2019re going to go after it pretty aggressively. Lee Krowl : Got it. Thank you for the details. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Jeff Van Rhee : [Indiscernible] surge in Zero Trust bookings, forgive me if I missed it, but just any comparable comment this quarter in terms of bookings on Zero Trust. And then the other related to Security as well. I think you had said a year ago that the demand for security services was about 1,000 users and a bit over $100 million in revenue. Is there any update there? Tom Leighton : I missed the first part of the question, but I think it had to do with our enterprise Zero Trust Solutions, and we had a very strong quarter there. We don\u2019t break out the individual numbers for that solution set yet, but we saw very strong growth and we were very pleased with that. With the Managed Security Services, as you can imagine, this is a time when our customers need us more than ever with that. You have the range of attacks increasing, their sophistication, and now our customers really busy trying to figure out how to securely support a remote workforce. So very pleased with the results there and the continued very strong growth of our Security Solutions. Jeff Van Rhee : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Brandon Nispel : Great. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to get you guys\u2019 thoughts on the CDN business. That business hasn\u2019t grown as fast in over five years and really exceeding where it has the last couple of years. I guess, is it your view that growth can get \u2013 be sustained at these levels? It doesn\u2019t seem like it from your guidance, but how should we think about the target growth rate for the CDN business over the next, call it, 18 to 36 months? Secondly, you made it a point, Ed, to call the balance sheet quick asset for the company. I was hoping you could outline some of your capital allocation priorities and share your thoughts on potentially any return to capital to shareholders beyond the share repurchase program, which you guys didn\u2019t repurchase that many shares this quarter. But hoping you could share some more details. Thanks. Ed McGowan : Sure. I\u2019ll take a step. So just in terms of the CDN business, on several calls ago, we were asked the question of what would it take to get the CDN business to get back to a healthy growth rate like what we have today. I think, well, no one would have predicted the pandemic would be the reason that, that would happen. I think to sort of kind of step back behind that, you think what behavior did it drive, it was significant adoption of Internet, video, gaming, e-commerce, online banking, just people using the Internet a lot more. And I would say that to the extent that anything drives that acceleration of any of those trends, we stand to gain. And I think the CDN business is going to always be a little bit lumpy in terms of its growth rate. I don\u2019t think we could sort of go up into the right, just given the dynamics in the business. We obviously have several verticals now that are challenged, travel and hospitality and retail, which has been kind of a challenged vertical for a while. When you get into the high-volume CDN business, you always have to deal with volume and pricing. I\u2019ve been with the company for 20 years, and that sort of rule has been in place since I started. That as companies grow volumes, unit prices go down. Our economics work the same way with our vendors and the way we build our network and design our technology to drive costs out. So you always have a little bit of lumpiness. But really, what you\u2019d have to look at is what are some of the macro trends? How successful are these OTT offerings? What\u2019s the next big trend in something like gaming? Do you get stabilization in your retail and travel vertical? So it\u2019s possible. I think this was a good test case in showing that it is possible to get back to a healthy growth rate in CDN. But there\u2019s a lot of things to consider with different dynamics, some that are out of our control. The other question was on capital allocation. Yes. So we don\u2019t \u2013 we talk about offsetting dilution. We\u2019ve done that in the past. And over time, if you look at our share count, opportunistically, we\u2019ve used our share buyback program to reduce the number of shares. Back in 2018, we did a large $750 million buyback. We don\u2019t have any intentions of doing that at this time. But it\u2019s something that we always talk to our Board about and always something that we look at. But right now, as I said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re looking at just offsetting dilution over time. And we\u2019d love to be able to find some good strategic acquisitions. We\u2019re always looking. We\u2019re very disciplined buyers, active shoppers. Valuations in some of the spaces that we\u2019re in, in security, in particular, started to correct a bit as we went into the beginning of the pandemic, but they certainly come out of that probably even a bit more stretched than when we went in. So we\u2019re going to be patient, look for the right opportunity, but M&A will certainly be an area that we look to utilize our capital that for. Brandon Nispel : Thank you. Tom Barth : Operator, we have time for one more call. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Henderson of Needham & Company. Your line is open. Roger Boyd : Hey, thanks for taking my question. This is Roger Boyd on for Alex. Just a quick question on e-commerce. Acknowledging that the broader retail market remains pressured, there\u2019s been a lot of opportunities in that space. I\u2019m just wondering, to the extent Akamai has been able to win new e-commerce logos in the current environment. And then secondly, given your investments in Botnet and Page Integrity, is it fair to say that is vertical value security a little more than the average customer, and that might be a differentiator for Akamai? Tom Leighton : Yes. So the first one, I didn\u2019t quite catch all the second one, so I\u2019ll ask you to repeat that after I hit the e-commerce question. I think the question was, does this enable us to \u2013 does this environment enable us to acquire new customers? Yes, sure. I mean I think it\u2019s an area where we, today, work with many of the large e-commerce customers today. But certainly, the way I look at it is, as companies are shifting from more brick-and-mortar to online, one of the conversations we\u2019re having with our customers is about that shift and what else, what other products do they need? And how are they planning on making more of a push towards online. So, I think that\u2019s a good trend for us. And I\u2019d say pretty much every retailer is \u2013 get some presence online. But certainly, there are some opportunities there. But for the flip side, there\u2019s also a lot of challenges in that market as well as we\u2019ve talked about. And I\u2019m sorry, can you just repeat your second question? Ed McGowan : I can answer that. Go ahead. Yes, the second question \u2013 with security, that is a huge differentiator for us. We\u2019re the market leader by far with Cloud Security Solutions. And as I mentioned, the vast majority of the world\u2019s biggest e-commerce sites make use of our security solutions. Today, I would say, in that vertical, sales are led by security, and then delivering acceleration would be an add-on. In fact, we include the basic DSA, Dynamic Site Accelerator services, part of Kona Site Defender. Thought manager is critical today for any commerce site, and we\u2019re really uniquely differentiated with our capabilities there. So security is very important across not only e-commerce but many verticals today. Roger Boyd : That\u2019s perfect, thank you. Tom Barth : Well, again, thank you, Tom and Ed. That wraps up, I think, our questions. So I want to thank everyone for joining us. In closing, we will be presenting at a number of virtual investor conferences and events throughout the rest of the third quarter, and details of those can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Thank you again for joining us. And all of us here at Akamai wish you continued health to you and yours. So have a nice evening. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may all disconnect. Have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tom Barth. Please go ahead. Tom Barth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today\u2019s comments include forward-looking statements including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include uncertainty stemming from COVID-19 pandemic and any impact from unexpected geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai\u2019s filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company\u2019s view on October 27, 2020. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.  As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.  And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom. And thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai achieved excellent results in the third quarter. Revenue was $793 million, up 12% year-over-year and up 11% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, up 3 points from Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.31 per diluted share, up 19% year-over-year, and up 18% in constant currency. These very strong results were driven primarily by the continued strong performance of our security products, and high traffic levels on our Edge platform. We're very proud of how Akamai has continued to deliver fast, intelligent and secure online experiences for billions of users around the world as we support our customers during these challenging times. We're also very pleased that our hard work to improve operating efficiency and profitability has put us in an excellent position to exceed our goal of 30% operating margins for the year. Our Media and Carrier business continued to perform very well in Q3, benefiting from high traffic levels for video streaming and gaming software downloads. In fact, one giant video-on-demand service increased the traffic on our platform by a factor of 4 last quarter. As more entertainment moves online, Akamai has continued to prove that our unique Edge platform scales to meet the unprecedented demand for streaming video, popular gaming releases, and complex API transactions. We can do this in part because we\u2019ve positioned more than 325,000 servers in more than 4,000 locations in over 1,000 cities. At Akamai, we\u2019ve positioned content very close to end users, and we make sure it's available when and where it's needed. In addition, our highly advanced Internet mapping algorithms route traffic around congestion to maintain excellent application performance for our customers. Our unique Edge platform also allows our customers to perform a wide variety of computational tasks close to end users, resulting in faster performance, instant scalability and lower cost. For example, a leading social networking company uses Akamai's Edge platform to manage API requests for their recommendation engine, a leading apparel company uses our platform to supply health information to users based on their fitness tracker. Several major companies use Akamai to provide critical weather updates based on local conditions, as well as geographic information such as nearby points of interest, or locations of desired services. Many of the world's largest OTT companies use Akamai to help manage the critical components of their architecture on the edge, including functionality for user authentication, content recommendations, and payment processing. Some of the world's largest credit card companies use our platform to assist with authentication and authorization of payments via digital gateways. Several of the world's largest gaming companies use Akamai's Edge to assist in managing user profiles and registration, as well as event leaderboards. And the ad tech ecosystem uses applications running on the Akamai Edge to assist with ad calls, bidding, and placing consent cookies to remain in compliant with data privacy regulations. It's important to note that while some CDNs are talking about edge computing or serverless computing, as if they're somehow new technologies, Akamai has been providing these services to thousands of customers for well over a decade. And already this year, we've handled well over 100 trillion API requests on our Edge platform. The vast capacity of our platform, combined with our unparalleled security intelligence and machine learning algorithms, has also enabled Akamai to defend many of the world's most important enterprises against the largest and most sophisticated cyber attacks. This capability has proved to be especially important during the recent wave of ransom DDoS attacks. Since August, we've been approached by dozens of major businesses around the world that had received extortion letters, threatening them with massive DDoS attacks, if they didn't pay a ransom. In response, our security experts performed emergency integrations of our Prolexic service, which enabled these enterprises to continue or resume business operations without experiencing any service disruptions from the attacks. As a result, we've added many new enterprises to our Prolexic customer base, including several global banks and insurance companies, a leading travel website, and two national stock exchanges. In addition to Prolexic, we also continue to see strong growth from our market leading Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager services. Bot Manager has been especially valuable in stopping account takeover attacks, which have greatly increased in scale and sophistication. In fact, the number of malicious login attempts by bots that we blocked in Q3 was more than double the number we handled in Q2. I'm also pleased to report that our recently launched Page Integrity Manager solution, which is designed to identify and forward Magecart attacks and malware in third-party scripts is off to an excellent start with strong customer interest and bookings. In another sign of our leadership in cyber security, Forrester recently named Akamai as a Leader in Zero Trust, with the highest possible scores for network security, workload security, APIs, zero trust advocacy and market approach. And just last week, Gartner recognized Akamai as a leader in its 2020 Magic Quadrant for Web Application Firewalls for the fourth year in a row. Overall, Q3 revenue from our Cloud Security Solutions was $266 million, up 23% year-over-year in constant currency and accounting for 34% of Akamai\u2019s total revenue. To further build on our growth in security, we were pleased to announce today that Akamai has acquired Asavie, a leader in securing mobile access for enterprises. Asavie partners with some of the world's largest mobile network operators to enable enterprises to connect, manage and secure communication among cellphones, and other IoT devices, without the need for client software on the device. These capabilities are critical for organizations with mobile workforces or large numbers of connected devices. By integrating Asavie solution with Akamai's unique Edge platform, and arming it with Akamai's vast array of real time security data, we plan to enable enterprises to greatly improve the security of their operations, while also improving the performance of their internal applications. Asavie will complement our security product lines with a cellular-specific security offering, which is an important step in our strategy to capture the emerging opportunity in 5G. It is also synergistic with our Enterprise Application Access product, and complements our IoT Edge cloud solution, allowing enterprises to improve the reliability and consistency of real time communications with IoT devices, and to easily secure those endpoints to avoid compromise. As we look to the future, we believe that the deployment of 5G and IoT applications can provide significant opportunities for Akamai. 5G technology improves the performance of the last mile, providing higher throughput and lower latency, and the potential to connect a lot more people and things. And that could spawn the creation of new applications, such as ultra-low latency video, augmented reality, IoT applications and analytics at a massive scale, deep threat intelligence for attack mitigation, and much more that we can't even imagine yet. The impact of 5G on innovation to be similar to the way broadband enabled new social networking apps that few could have imagined before. As 5G networks come online, we believe that end users and connected devices will demand faster performance and greater scale than cloud data centers can provide. And thus, that our Edge architecture will become more important than ever.  In fact, Gartner estimates that by 2022, more than half of enterprise generated data will be created and processed outside of traditional cloud data centers. The breadth of our Edge platform means that we're incredibly close to billions of end users. And being so close means that Akamai is in a unique position to provide the near instant response times, very high quality video experiences, serverless computing capabilities, and the market-leading security services that our customers are demanding. In summary, we're very pleased with our performance so far this year. We believe that our strong growth, profitability and cash generation provides us with a financial firepower to continue investing in the innovation, network capacity, novel products, and world class talent needed to fuel our future growth. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on Q3, and our outlook for the fourth quarter. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. As Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter from Q3. We were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on revenue, operating margin and earnings. Q3 revenue was $793 million, up 12% year-over-year for 11% in constant currency, driven by another quarter of robust security growth, continued strong performance from our Media and Carrier Division and a weaker U.S. dollar. Revenue from our Web Division was $418 million, up 8% year-over-year, or 7% in constant currency. Revenue growth for this group of customers was again led by our security business and to a lesser extent we also benefited from lower-than-expected COVID-related credits to customers. Revenue from our Media and Carrier Division was $375 million, up 16% year-over-year. The overachievement in Q3 came from higher-than-expected OTT video and gaming traffic, along with continued momentum in security.  We were pleased to see traffic remain at elevated levels, which helped offset the approximately $15 million negative impact from India's ban of 59 Chinese apps that we discussed on our last quarter's call. Revenue from the Internet Platform Customers was $51 million, up 15% from the prior year, and above our expectations due to higher traffic. Security revenue for the third quarter was $266 million, up 23% year-over-year, driven by continued global demand for our Web and Enterprise Security Solutions. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we also saw strong demand for DDoS protection from our Prolexic products in Q3.  Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $10 million on a sequential basis and positive $4 million on a year-over-year basis. International revenue was $355 million of 20% year-over-year or 18% in constant currency. We had strong performance internationally despite the sequential headwinds in India that I previously mentioned. Sales in our international markets represent 45% of total revenue in Q3, up 3 points from Q3 2019 and up 1 point from Q2 levels. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $437 million, up 6% year-over-year.  Now moving to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 64%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $252 million roughly flat with Q2 levels, and in line with our guidance.  Now moving on to profitability, adjusted EBITDA was $351 million, up $51 million or 17% from the same period in 2019. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 44%, up 2 points from Q3 2019. Non-GAAP operating income was $251 million, up $43 million or 20% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 32%, up 3 points from Q3 last year. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $200 million, in line with our guidance range. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $159 million or $0.95 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $216 million, or $1.31 of earnings per diluted share, up 19% year-over-year, up 18% in constant currency and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance range due to higher-than-expected revenue.  Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $37 million based on a Q3 effective tax rate of approximately 15%.  Now, I will discuss some balance sheet items. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet. As of September 30th, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.6 billion, up approximately $163 million from the end of Q2. After accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our two convertible notes, net cash was approximately $254 million as of September 30th. This increase was driven by a number of factors that include an exceptionally strong cash collections quarter.  Now, I will review our use of capital. During the third quarter, we spent $13 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 120,000 shares. We ended Q3 with approximately $644 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Our long-term plan remains to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution resulting from equity compensation over time. In summary, we're very pleased with our Q3 results.  Before I provide guidance, I wanted to take a moment to remind everyone of several factors that will impact Q4. First, seasonality plays a large role in determining our fourth quarter financial performance. We typically see higher-than-normal traffic for our large media customers, and from seasonal online retail activity for our e-commerce customers, which are both difficult to predict, especially in the current economic environment. Also, as Tom mentioned earlier, today, we announced the acquisition of Asavie. In the fourth quarter, we expect the acquisition to add approximately $4 million of revenue and to be dilutive by approximately $0.01 of non-GAAP EPS. It\u2019s also worth noting, as I mentioned earlier, that our Q3 revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $15 million due to the actions taken by the Indian government to ban 59 Chinese based web applications in India. Our Q4 guidance as soon as the ban in India remains in place for the balance of 2020. In addition, the U.S. government has taken a similar stance with respect to some of these applications. And absent court action or change in policy, those bans are scheduled to take effect in mid-November. As a result, our Q4 guidance assumes an additional $4 million to $5 million negative impact to revenue sequentially based on the U.S. ban going into effect mid-November. In the unanticipated events, these 59 applications were subject to a total global ban, the total additional negative impact to our revenue would only be approximately 3%. To be clear, this represents an extreme assumption that we do not currently expect to occur, and we are not modeling in our current outlook. However, I wanted to provide you with additional color for added transparency, and to make the point that our customer base remains well-diversified across many customers, industries, products and geographies.  Finally, at current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $2 million impact on Q4 revenue compared to Q3 revenue -- Q3 levels and a positive $6 million impact year-over-year. Taking all these factors into consideration, we're projecting Q4 revenue in the range of $812 million to $837 million or up 4% to 8% in constant currency over Q4 2019. To frame our guidance further, we would expect to be towards the lower end of the range if we see a more modest quarter for OTT and gaming traffic, if e-commerce activity is weaker than expected, the impact of the COVID pandemic leads to an inability of our customers to pay for our services and the U.S. dollar strengthens and creates foreign exchange headwinds. Conversely, we'd expect to be at the higher end of the range if we see -- if we experience a more robust than normal online holiday shopping season, and we see stronger than expected demand for OTT video and gaming traffic, including potential upside from two highly publicized new game console releases expected later this quarter. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margin of approximately 76%. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $268 million to $279 million, with a sequential increase primarily due to higher commissions-related expenses from sales compensation accelerators kicking in during the fourth quarter, given our very strong performance this year relative to our plan.  Factoring in the gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of approximately 43%.  Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $106 million to $108 million, reflecting our accelerated server deployment in Q3. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% for Q4.  Moving on to CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $193 million to $199 million excluding equity compensation in the fourth quarter. And with the overall revenue spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.28 to $1.32, or up 2% to 5% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $36 million to $37 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 15%. And it also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares.  In light of the Q4 guidance I've just provided and our strong performance for the third quarter, for the full year 2020, we now expect revenue of $3.164 billion to $3.189 billion, which is up 10% year-over-year in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 31%. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.16 to $5.20, which is up 15% to 16% year-over-year.  In summary, we are very pleased with how our business has continued to perform during a very challenging time.  Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Tim Horan : Can you talk about Edge a little bit more, maybe on how your service offers compare with your peers? And what do you think your win rate is on pitches for Edge? Tom Leighton : Well, Edge refers to our platform, which really is unique in the sense that -- we're in 4,000 locations. We're in 1,000 cities. We are uniquely close to the end users out there, the billions of end users around the world. Other companies talk about edge, and they might be in a couple of dozen locations, a factor of 100 or less. And because we're close, that's really important, because we're going to give better performance. If you're closer, the latency is less, and it's going to be faster.  Also, if you're close, you got access to the bandwidth and the scale. And that's why we have so much more scale than the other CDNs. And that's really important to customers that have a lot of traffic, the big OTT providers and the big software downloaders. And that's why so much of their business comes to Akamai. Also, being in those locations gives us a huge advantage on cost, because in the large fraction of those 4,000 locations, we don't pay for bandwidth and colo and power. And so it's free for us with the infrastructure. We pay for our CapEx. But our competitors aren't there. There our competitors are in big data centers, and that is the most expensive real estate in the world. And so we're in a position that we can provide compelling pricing to the major enterprises out there. And our competitors, if they're going to do that, they have to do it losing money, and that's not sustainable.  Now any one of the many competitors we have out there, all, generally speaking, much, much smaller, at any given time, they could take on some traffic and show some high percentage growth on very small numbers. But it's hard to sustain that when you don't really have a sustainable advantage. And then you see that happen as the traffic -- some of the traffic share moves around among the smaller players.  Now in addition, it's not just about CDN and delivering traffic, it's accelerating the traffic. It's providing functionality on the edge close to the end user. And I talked about a lot of examples that where we're doing that today. And of course, processing a lot of the API transactions, which are tied to functionality, over 100 trillion so far this year. And then you have the security aspect, which our CDN competitors, by and large, don't have. They make partner with other companies or start-ups to have some security story. But that's now $1 billion business for Akamai and growing at over 20%. And security is just really vital for our customers and it works in tandem with the application acceleration, with the Edge computing, all is one service, all on one platform. And if you're not on the edge, there's no hope to withstand the large attacks that we're seeing today. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Just going back to security. I'm just curious, would the security results thus far this year have been much different had COVID-19 not had happened? I'm just curious how you would quantify the impact that COVID-19 has had on the security business, whether good or bad? And then secondly, the long-term operating margin of 30%, I think you've messaged that, that should remain flat target. But can you just remind us why that is and why we won't continue to see increased operating margin leverage? Tom Leighton : Sure. I think we'd see strong security growth with or without COVID. There are some of our products that are really helpful for enterprises as they have more of a remote workforce. And so we did see uptick in bookings there. So I think there's some help. The attack rates have gone way up. And I do think some of that has tied to COVID. Now whether we see the ransom DDoS attacks that are widespread just in the last couple of months, we might have seen that anyway. Maybe there's an increase because the price is bigger now. If you're attacking a commerce company that has 90% of their business in brick-and-mortar, well, they care about the 10% for sure, but when all of their business is online, now they really really care. So there is a bigger price, and maybe that's incented the attackers to up the attack level or maybe that's just the world we're living in, where we're going to be seeing more and more attacks, even if we get COVID under control. And I can tell you, we see a lot of attacks in Asia Pacific just like we do here and in Europe. Even though in APJ, COVID is largely under control there and operations are largely returned to normal. And yet the attacks -- the ransom DDoS attacks are just as -- increasing just as fast over there. In fact, one of the national stock exchanges that was taken offline that is now an Akamai customer was in Asia Pacific.  In terms of the 30%, we do think that's a good place to operate the company over the longer term. And we're -- that said, we're going to do everything we can to operate as efficiently as possible and you see that this year. This year, we've been doing over 30%. And so if we can do that and continue to make the investments we want to make to achieve long-term growth in the business, then we will. But I think the right way to think about it is 30% is a good baseline and when we can overachieve that, we're going to do that. Colby Synesael : And I guess just one quick follow-up to the security question. I mean given what sounds like some upside, arguably, do you think that you're in a position to sustain that 20%-plus growth rate over the next few years? Tom Leighton : Certainly, we'd like to do that. We're seeing very strong growth in Kona Site Defender and Prolexic. And Kona Site defender is our web app firewall product. Bot Manager doing very well, and the next-generation of that will be even stronger at preventing account takeover. Security services business we talked about is doing very well. And I think with the increase in attacks and the sophistication of attacks, we're seeing even more demand for our security services. It's just too hard for even major enterprises to keep up. And then you have the newer solutions, our enterprise services, Enterprise Application Access, Enterprise Threat Protector, now equipped with the first version of our Secure Web Gateway. We're going into beta with our multifactor authentication service next month. As we talked about, our Page Integrity Manager, which sits on top of Kona, off to a great start. We'd like to see that track the way that Bot Manager did getting out of the gate.  And of course, we announced today -- and I'm really excited about the Asavie acquisition. I think that opens up a whole new category for us that we'll see accelerated growth as we get more 5G deployments as you see more IoT applications out there. And what that does is it sends all the cellular traffic safely and directly to Akamai before it gets on to the Internet. And in that way, we can really protect enterprises and their cellular devices. And I think that's a market that is very exciting for the future. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty : So wondering, you made the comment that one of the big video providers, you saw 4x increase in traffic, that would seem to be more than just a COVID related. I'm just wondering what else you saw in that particular account? And is that something is happening in other accounts as well? Tom Leighton : Yes. As we talked about and we're continuing to gain share, if you exclude the 59 Chinese apps where obviously government regulation has lessened the traffic we're delivering there. And that's based on our scale and performance and ability to offer market competitive prices for our customers. And so I think you've seen that trend over the last couple of years, we've talked about it. We put a lot of effort into continuing to improve performance, continuing to improve our scale and on a global basis. And that puts us in a great position against the competition in the market. And you're right, the 4x is obviously not COVID. COVID did improve traffic, there's no question about that, but nothing like 4x. Sterling Auty : That's great. And then one follow-up. You touched upon it in your prepared remarks and your guidance, which is e-commerce heading into the holiday season. It's been a little while since you've updated us. Can you give us a sense of where do you sit in terms of your customer base within like that e-tailing 100 or that 100 largest e-commerce sites and vendors that are out there? Tom Leighton : Very, very strong. Well north of 90% of the top commerce companies rely on Akamai for application acceleration, and also importantly, increasingly importantly, security. And as I mentioned before, now that these companies, a lot of them, most all of their business is online. And so security really, really matters now, and we're obviously the go-to supplier there. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead. James Fish : Tom, you sound really excited here on these new security solutions again. I guess, how are you thinking about the web security gateway market? And do you need more investment in an enterprise security sales team to get this product more penetrated and beyond just the CDN installed base? James Fish : Yes. In fact, a lot of our customers for the enterprise products are new to Akamai and hadn't bought our pre-existing product line. And that's because our web products, delivery and web app firewall were primarily to a subset of the Fortune 500, maybe a third of the verticals to half of the verticals. But enterprise security is something that pretty much all the Fortune 500 would need. And so that has increased our market, and we have put effort into our specialist teams that help the sales force. I would say that all of our sales force now is very adept at selling the traditional Akamai security products. And most of them are actually pretty good now at the newer products with enterprise security, Page Integrity Manager. SWG is just new out there. So very early on. But I think we're in good shape there. And Asavie of course, that's sold by carriers as is our SPS solution. And so we would sell to the world\u2019s -- or Asavie -- now Akamai sell to the world's major carriers and provide a solution that they then take to enterprises. And I think that's a model that we're very excited about. And increasingly, you'll see with our enterprise security products, will be led by channel partners and carriers being the majority of that. Sterling Auty : Just as my follow-up, we're starting to see a new wave of applications, get the size again like we did last decade with Netflix and YouTube being 2 examples. I guess, what are you guys hearing from customers regarding their own potential CDN build-outs for some of the applications that they have? One of your customers, for example, hit their 5-year goal within 1 year. Tom Leighton : Wait, so are you asking about what are we seeing in terms of DIY? Or what are we seeing in terms of big OTT players and their market penetration success? Sterling Auty : Both. I'll take both. Tom Leighton : Okay. Well, yes, OTT is certainly increasing, and a lot of the offers are seeing substantial success. Obviously, some are doing better than others. But I do think OTT is here to stay. Obviously, got tailwinds from the pandemic. But I think people are -- as they view more online, that becomes more of the pattern and that will outlive the pandemic. Of course, I think we'd all like to get back to a world when you can go out and see a movie, probably not going to be anytime soon here in the Americas or in EMEA. And I think more and more of the movie watching and TV shows will be watched online. DIY is something that you know that we exist in a few of the largest content providers. And I don't think we've seen a huge shift there. You can sort of track that with our -- the cloud giant customers, which has been fairly steady over the last year or so. It's really hard to build out something like that for yourself. It costs hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more, you end up spending more than you would with Akamai, and you don't get the quality you get with Akamai. And not only that, if you're a global company, you got to do it all around the world, that's just -- it doesn't make sense. Now some of the biggest companies do it, and I think you'll continue to see that. But there's not been a real fundamental shift there. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ray McDonough : This is Ray McDonough on for Brad. First, Tom, if I could, I wanted to ask about gaming. And as you mentioned, we're approaching a new console cycle with both Sony and Microsoft coming out with new consoles. And from what I understand, they've made some changes to how games will be downloaded. With the caveat that downloads and gaming files are becoming larger and more ubiquitous, how should investors think about the contribution of gaming? How much does it represent today? And how big of a growth driver do you think it can be into next year? Tom Leighton : I'm going to hand that one over to Ed. Ed McGowan : Yes. So obviously, gaming has been a business that's changed for us quite a bit over the last couple of years. You see the multi-player gaming has changed the dynamics. And if you think about the consoles that are coming online, obviously, 2 major players, it's been say, 4, 5 years since we've had a major upgrade cycle. So I would say you can kind of throw history out, this is sort of a new chapter. I think it could be a good source of upside for us. In terms of its contribution, we don't break it out specifically, but I would say it's probably the second largest contributor in our media business next to video. So as I talked about in the guidance section that this could be a source of upside. And it's hard to tell, we'll know when we get there, but this could last into the early part of next year as some of the publishers come up with new games and the consumers are buying the new consoles, they have to update the system with firmware and then catchup with all the old games that they had.  So I think this is a pretty good trend for us. It's hard to predict whenever you have something that's large. And as you rightly pointed out, the game downloads, the frequency and the size are only increasing. Ray McDonough : Yes. That makes a ton of sense. I appreciate that color. And if I could, just a quick follow-up. Coming out of the first half of the year, there seems to be some supply constraints industry-wide. Understanding that every region is a bit different, how is capacity industry-wide trending? And how should investors think about your capital expenditure plans into next year? Ed McGowan : Yes. Great question. So obviously, this year was a pretty big year for CapEx. And we've really been on the journey here for the last, call it, 18 months, where we've increased the capacity of the network. And I'm glad we did. I think Tom and the team made a great decision to do this. Obviously, we couldn't have predicted the pandemic, but we had a lot of new OTT launches coming. And as we talked about just a few minutes ago on gaming, that's becoming more and more challenging because customers want to get their games at the same time. And that requires a lot more capacity. And so we spent quite a bit on CapEx. We actually took advantage of some bulk purchases here at the end of the year. We've added a tremendous amount to our capacity. So I would expect next year to be back in sort of the normal level of CapEx and down several points from what we're seeing today. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Will Power with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Will Power : Okay. Great. I'll ask just a couple here. Maybe first, I'd love to get some perspective on what you're seeing in international arena. And I guess, really, despite the challenges you were facing in India, you continue to see strong growth. So maybe just if you can just touch on what the sources of the strength were kind of outside of India? Tom Leighton : Yes, sure. So, yes, you are right to point out, it\u2019s actually not India that was impacted, it was actually China because the customers that were impacted, the 59 Chinese apps, we serve about 30 of them. Those were actually customers in China. So China revenue, obviously, was a bit more challenged this quarter. Actually, India was actually one of the areas of strength. What I was encouraged by is I saw in many different countries, in all different geographies, so Latin America, Brazil and Mexico, over in Europe, we saw strength in the UK, Germany in the Netherlands. And then over in Asia, we saw strength in Australia, Indonesia and continued strength in Japan. So it's really across the board. We're very pleased with international growth. And if you think about coming into a quarter where you're losing $15 million of revenue from your international customer base and to be able to still grow sequentially and grow 20% year-over-year, it's very impressive. And as I've talked about in other calls, I think we have a unique advantage in the industry from an international perspective. We made the investments early on in sales and building out our network and our capabilities that I think it's a huge advantage for us, and we\u2019ve done remarkably well, not only in just delivering media but also in security. Will Power : Is that international strength concentrated in any particular products or solutions or is it more broad-based? Tom Leighton : I'd say it's more broad-based. Certainly, the early days, it was all about media delivery and application acceleration. The U.S. market was the first to adopt the security solutions. But now security is becoming a really nice growth engine for us internationally. Will Power : Okay. And then kind of my second core question, just around M&A, notwithstanding the acquisition announced this morning. Maybe you can just update us on appetite for M&A as we exit this year and into 2021. Maybe any color around areas of focus and potential size, kind of what you're seeing out there in the market? Tom Leighton : Yes, we continue to be very active in looking at potential deals. Obviously, it's a little trickier with the pandemic because travel is restricted, but that's not preventing us from doing transactions, as you saw from today's announcement. I would say so far the pandemic really hasn't impacted market caps very much, that may happen at some point depending on what happens with the global economy. So, I would say it's business as usual right now. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : A lot of the questions I had were covered. So a couple of kind of more detailed questions, if you will. One, on that gaming theme, a lot of what people were talking about for gaming on a go forward basis is shifting to more streaming to game subscriptions. And it's not just Microsoft, there are like other vendors have their platform for game streaming. Can you talk to us about how optimized or positioned for that potential shift towards more of a game streaming? It sounds like something that would be kind of right up your alley. Tom Leighton : Yes, so it depends exactly what you're referring to. But if it's a gaming tournament, where a lot of people are watching, yes, we do that already. And that creates a fair amount of traffic. If it's a situation where an individual's game and their screen is being streamed, we don't do that very much. We will handle the metadata and the security around that. The economics around streaming individuals, what they would see on their screen, that's pretty challenging. People have been working at that, the big gaming companies for well over a decade and haven't really gotten the economics to work. But we would handle the metadata, the security, the log-ins, the leader board, all that kind of stuff, we handle. It's just the individual stream is not so economical. Keith Weiss : And then one detailed question on the security solutions. In particular, Access is a solution that you guys have rolled out. And it's something that we hear a lot from a lot of different vendors across the spectrum, whether it's guys coming from like a security perspective, like a Zscaler or Citrix as their access solutions. Can you talk to us about sort of how the competitive environment in there is shaking out for you guys? Where do you guys see yourselves doing well? And who do you run-up against most often? Tom Leighton : Yes. We compete well with Zscaler there. I would say that the vast majority of the competition is the traditional CPE vendors and the traditional ways of doing things. And our value proposition is that we can do it in the cloud. That's a lot easier and more secure. And we can -- once we have it and we're providing the access, we can layer in Kona Site Defender and our other technologies, which the other companies don't have. And that makes it a superior service. So I'm optimistic about the future growth there, and even though we compete with Zscaler and we compete well, really, the 2 of us are out there competing against the traditional way of doing things. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead Lexi Curnin : This is Lexi on for Amit. So I guess, the December quarter guide implies that sales were up around 7% year-over-year, and that's kind of a strong deceleration versus the 12% to 13% range we've seen over the last few quarters. I guess the India and U.S. then account for $20 million or 200 basis points of drag. But beyond that, what do you see as kind of the headwinds there? Tom Leighton : Yes. So I think if you look the last couple of quarters, certainly, Q2 was -- we saw a big jump due to the pandemic and the additional traffic that we've got on. The good news is we've been able to maintain the traffic and even fill in the divot that was caused by the $15 million in Q4. And you're right to point out the fact that, that revenue was gone and I talked about an additional $4 million if this U.S. ban goes into effect here coming up in mid-November. Last Q4 was an exceptionally strong quarter-over-quarter. There's a few things if you want to look at kind of comparing the jump that we normally see from Q3 to Q4. We just talked about the -- those applications, the Chinese applications is one piece. As you recall, in Q2, I talked about some license revenue, it was about $7 million that we saw from our carrier business. That traditionally we see in Q4 and we saw in Q4 last year, we're not expecting that again. So that's a piece of it.  And then the other thing that is a little bit different this year. If you recall, back in Q2 of 2019, we had our customer conference, and we introduced our zero overage offering to our Web Division customers. And that was really a response to customers who are looking for more predictable spend with Akamai. You can imagine retailers are the ones who mostly go for this offering. And again, it's web, it's not for media customers. And that's to smooth out some of the different holidays and various peaks that they have in their business. Now that's been in the market now for about 18 months. So we're starting to see some pretty good uptake on that. And what that means is you just see a little bit of a flattening out your seasonality. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead. James Breen : Just one on security. Can you just give us a little color around the 23% growth? And how much of that came from existing customers taking new products? And maybe on that point, if you have security customers taking 3 of your products and they take a fourth, I believe most of that business is contractual. How does that manifest itself into the relationship or the contract with the company at the time? And then just secondly on CDN and media, traditionally, we see a little bit of a step down in volumes in the third quarter as more people are outside in July and August. We didn't see as much last year this timeframe. It doesn't seem like you saw it this year. Just your overall thoughts on that and OTT sort of overtaking some of the linear television, et cetera? Tom Leighton : Yes, great question. So I'll start with the second one. We didn't -- you're right, we didn't see as much of a seasonal dip. I did see a little bit in Europe towards the end of the quarter. You got to remember that we also have been in kind of a partial lockdown for most of the summer. So I would say that, that probably adds to it. We do typically see a seasonal dip here in Q3. But again, outside of a little bit in Europe, I didn't really see much across the world. So that was a good trend for us.  And your first question was around security growth of 23%. What's making it up? I think the question was around new versus existing. Primarily, the biggest growth is from existing customers. Today, we have about 61% roughly of our customers buy security from us. And our new customer acquisition is led by security, but in the recurring revenue business in any given quarter new customers aren't going to add a ton to the revenue pile. So it's typically your existing customers.  And then the other question on as customers contract with us for multiple services. It tends to be -- sometimes it could be demand driven. So if you have something like a ransomware attack, you have an emergency integration, you just add that to your contract. In other times, it can be upon renewal where you're adding functionality, so somebody might be Kona Site Defender customer they want to add Bot Manager. We're seeing some really good early uptake with customers, that our Kona Site Defender customers that are adding Page Integrity. And that could be done mid contract, if we go in and just add it to your contract. Typically, you have some form of an MSA with your customer and you can just add that product fairly easily. James Breen : And just a follow-up to that, as you look across your entire revenue base right now, in terms of total revenue, how much of that is contractual versus more volume driven like your traditional CDN business? Tom Leighton : In that business, I'd say a majority of it is contractual. There is some volumetric components to security. But really, when you think about the business in total, the big variable in terms of volumes is in the media business. James Breen : And in terms of total revenue, as you look at media and security combined, how much of your total revenue you think is more volume driven? Tom Leighton : That's a good question, probably a quarter, maybe a third at the most. It depends on the quarter. In a quarter like this, Q4, where you have stronger seasonality, you'll see a little bit more than normal. But the majority of the business is contractual. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeff Van Rhee : Most of what I had has been answered. Just a few on the managed security services. I remember a while back, you had referenced that I believe is 1,000 customers and a $100 million in revenue. I don't know that we've gotten an update. Just curious if you could update that? And then any commentary around verticals that stood out for AKAM in the quarter? Tom Leighton : Sure. So in terms of managed security services, I don't have a customer number here for you. We'll probably give you a more fulsome security update later when we get to next year. But it's still growing at double-digits, which is great. So managed security services has been actually really a key differentiator for us. What we're finding is while we've built tools for customers to be able to manage their security products on their own, a lot of times, they want us to do it for them. For example, Bot Manager, we're finding that there's a lot of demand for managed Bot Manager. It doesn't sound like the greatest product name, but it\u2019s descriptive of what's happening. And then on the Kona Site Defender side, managing firewall rules can be complicated, and oftentimes, customers would like us to do that as well. Ed McGowan : Yes. In terms of the verticals, obviously, the financial vertical is huge, as you can imagine, for security. Commerce, increasingly important as more of their business moves online. And interestingly enough, big media, gaming sites are now seeing a lot of attacks, new sites, obviously, especially during an election cycle, are big targets. And OTT sites and protecting accounts there is really important. So pretty much any big brand name is a big buyer of our security services. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hannah Rudoff : This is Hannah Rudoff on for Rishi. So on the Asavie acquisition, could you just talk about what overlap there is between you and them, both in terms of the actual technology today and then the customer bases? Tom Leighton : I didn't catch that question. Can you repeat it, please? Hannah Rudoff : Yes. On the Asavie acquisition, could you just talk about what overlap there is between you and Asavie in terms of actual technology and the customer bases? Tom Leighton : Great. No, really good question. There is not a lot of overlap there. Their primary capability is to take the traffic from a cellular device and vector it through the carrier into what today is their platform. Now we are going to take that in vector it into the Akamai platform, and then we can layer in our enterprise security capabilities, our application firewall capabilities, Secure Web Gateway, make sure that traffic stays secure, so that the device doesn't end up going to a site with malware, or -- and if it does, to make sure that malware doesn't get back on the device. And so there's a very little overlap in capabilities, but very strong synergy. And the really nice thing is that their technology doesn't need to make use of a client. And a lot of the devices out there, especially in IoT, may not be equipped with that kind of capability. They'll just go straight with a cellular connection. And also, there's no way around it because it's handled with the SIM card layer So it's not a situation like with a normal device where the user can sort of get around any corporate security and go where they want and then get malware on the device and bring it back into the enterprise. Hannah Rudoff : And then is there anything to call out on this quarter with regard to the Internet Platform Customers aside from the higher traffic? I know you guys expected a greater sequential decline due to repricing. And then how should we think about growth of this cohort for the remainder of the year? Ed McGowan : Yes, great question. So yes, definitely a nice upside surprise for us. As I mentioned on the last call, we did do repricing with 2 large customers in that cohort. And typically, it takes, call it, 6 to 9 months to get back to traffic levels where your revenue sort of gets back to where it started from. We were able to do that and more here in Q3. So that was great, and it was a big jump in traffic from a couple of customers. So really good news there. And I would say, in terms of this year -- remainder of this year, Q4 tends to be a pretty strong quarter. So I'd expect something in this range, maybe a touch higher. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brandon Nispel : Two, if I could. What are you guys seeing from a traffic perspective thus far in the fourth quarter versus really the third quarter? And taking a step back, how should we think about the higher traffic growth in 2020 translating into some contract repricing situation into 2021? Then on the acquisition, you called out $4 million in revenue. Is it safe to assume that, that acquisition you've closed today, and it's a 2-month benefit for this year, roughly. And can we annualize that in terms of modeling purposes for next year with some growth expectation? Ed McGowan : Yes. So why don't I start with the last one and my way back. So as far as the acquisition goes, yes, I mean, that's the way the math would work out for this quarter. Just keep in mind that when you go through purchase accounting and you do your integration costs and things like that, there's some movement there. We'll give you an update on how much revenue contribution this will be for next year when we do our next call. But yes, you're thinking about it in a way. But in terms of like how much growth add-on and things like that, we'll update you as we get few months into the integration and have a plan fully built out.  For 2020, '21, you talked about pricing and volumes. It's just a standard part of the business. We'll always have some number of customers that are up for renewal at any given time, average contract length is typically 18 months and from a year to 2, sometimes you get a little longer. So at any given time, you're going to have renewals. I think we've done a good job of calling out when there's anything that's unusual, meaning you have a big group of customers that are all coming up at once or we talked about last year when we had some big acquisitions with some of our customers acquiring each other. We'll continue to do that, but there's really nothing to call out at this point, and we'll be giving you a full update on '21 in the February call. And then I think your third question was on traffic for the fourth quarter. Are we seeing anything relative to Q3? Obviously, in back-to-school fall season, we do see a slight pickup in traffic. We included that in our guidance. I think the only thing to call out is weekends, we do see elevated traffic sports, they\u2019ve been a nice source of traffic for us and that certainly continues this year. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Lee Krowl with B. Riley Securities. Your line I open. Please go ahead. Lee Krowl : Two quick questions. I think you mentioned the Web Division saw some upside from customer credits. Curious if you could quantify that upside? And then if there is a similar contribution in Q4? Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So I wouldn't necessarily call the contribution. I think the way I would describe it is, if you recall on the Q1 call, we talked about how the negative impact was around $5 million. And in Q2, we talked about it being $14 million. So going into the quarter, we had modeled that we would have a further negative impact. It's really hard to predict what's never been in one of these before. So it's really hard to predict what customers are going to request and ask for. So the good news there is we had very less than [$1 million] impact. As a matter of fact, we had a little bit of a positive impact in our bad debt assumptions as we had assumed with some customers that had filed for bankruptcy that have come back post-bankruptcy, were a little bit higher up on the chain there. So we were able to recover some of that money that we had to write-off. So in general, that was a positive surprise. So I wouldn't say that it was a pickup of any kind that we would expect in this quarter. I think what I outlined in the guidance section was there's a potential that if we get into a second wave, and we see customers get under a lot of stress that you could see something similar to what we've seen in prior quarters. We're not anticipating that right now. But that's obviously something as you kind of build your models and handicap that you'd want to think about. The worst the pandemic gets, the more stress the retailers are under, the more stress to travel and hospitality. Customers are under -- there's a potential that you could see a little bit of headwind there, if we have to do some things on the restructuring or credit side. Lee Krowl : Got it. And then just another question. You guys added a lot of capacity in '19 and certainly significant capacity in 2020 in response to both streaming media as well as kind of the pandemic-related uptick in traffic. As we lap those comparisons for both capacity as well as traffic growth and we kind of hit some of the slower quarters with that added capacity, maybe just talk about the puts and takes between margins and keeping the servers running hard to offset cost? One of your competitors kind of indicated a little bit of a margin headwind as server capacity overstretched a pullback in demand. As we lap some difficult comps over the coming quarters, how do you kind of think about capacity versus the margin standpoint? Ed McGowan : Yes. Good question. So mix is obviously something that you have to take into consideration. The good news for us, if you think about the 20 plus years we've been in this business, we've always seen unit economics where volumes go up, prices go down. We've been able to do a phenomenal job of driving down costs in our network. And the fact that we're at such a scale, there's a mix between fixed contracts versus variable contracts. We get -- as Tom mentioned, a lot of our traffic is free, and that sometimes going to include both space, power and bandwidth. So we have a whole team that is maniacally focused on that, and we continue to make improvements in our server capacity to be able to get more throughput per machine.  So obviously, as mix changes, you can have a point here or there move. But in general, I think we've done a phenomenal job maintaining margins despite the realities of the high-volume media business. So I don't know the specifics of what you're talking about with our competitor, but we don't see any significant declines in margins as a result of adding all this capacity. If anything, I think it gives us a tremendous advantage. One of the interesting things that we saw this quarter, well, I saw -- we lost a lot of traffic in India. We actually picked up a lot of traffic in India from other customers as a result of having additional capacity, you get better performance, the more capacity you have and we were able to benefit and fill in some of that gap of the $15 million we lost and some of it was released in the India region. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Okay, thanks. All my business questions were asked. So I'll just ask, in the event of a change in administration next week and you think about the implications for your business in terms of everything from R&D tax credit policies, I don\u2019t know immigration issues, corporate tax rates, what do you think will be the biggest impacts on your business? Were there to be a change in administration? Tom Leighton : Well, maybe the -- just settling down the overall environment out there would be good. Stress levels are obviously pretty high in the country -- in this country right now. And it'd be good to get past that. Obviously, taxes might rise. I don't think that changes the operation of the business in any way. Obviously, there'll be a one-time reset on EPS if tax rate were to go up. And Ed can talk more to that. But I don't see the fundamentals of our business changing one way or another depending on who wins. Ed, what thoughts do you have about that? Ed McGowan : Yes. It\u2019s a good question, Mark. So I would say, in terms of taxes, obviously, a lot of our earnings come from outside the U.S. So it's rumored that there's a 7% increase or whatever may come at some point. And who knows if it comes in '21 or they wait a year to put it in \u201822. It would have some impact on us. But like I said, a lot of our earnings are outside the U.S. A couple of other things to keep an eye on, though, interest rates. So with the Fed being very accommodative and interest rates at near zero, think about our reinvestment of our marketable securities. So you're going to get a lower interest rate in terms of returns. So that's going to impact your [geared view as such]. And then the last thing would be around foreign exchange. So depending on what type of stimulus you have, if the dollar gets weaker because as a result of us printing more money, then obviously, that could be a benefit for us because the way to think about our international business is we've got -- we're profitable outside the U.S. and nearly half of our business is outside the U.S. So that can be a benefit potentially if the dollar were to get weaker. So those would be sort of the 3 areas financially that sort of jump off the page at me. Tom Barth : Well, thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at a number of virtual investor conferences and events throughout the rest of the fourth quarter. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Thank you for joining us. All of us here at Akamai wish you continued health to you and yours, and I have a very nice evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you Please go ahead, Sir. Tom Barth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today\u2019s comments include forward-looking statements including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include uncertainty stemming from COVID-19 pandemic and any impact from unexpected geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai\u2019s filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company\u2019s view on February 09, 2020. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom. And thank you all for joining us today. I am pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent results for both the both the fourth quarter and the full year in spite of the extraordinary challenges that we all faced in 2020. Q4 revenue was $846 million up 10% over Q4 2019 and up 8% in constant currency. This strong result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security business and continued high traffic on our intelligent Edge platform. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 30% up one point over Q4 2019 and Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1.33 per diluted share, up 8% year-over-year and up 6% in constant currency. For the full year we surpassed our expectations for the top -- setting new records for our business and positioning us well for our future. Full-year 2020 revenue was $3.2 billion up 11% over the prior year in constant currency and topping that $3 billion mark in the first time in our history. We're especially pleased to report that we expanded non-GAAP operating margin to 31% in 2020 overachieving our targeted 30%. This is up dramatically from 24% in 2017. I think it's worth noting that we achieve this expansion over the past three years while also investing for future growth. Non-GAAP EPS for 2020 was $5.22 per share up 16% over 2019 and exceeding $5 per share for the first time. We also generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations last year, up 15% over 2019 and representing 38% of revenue. Our securities portfolio continued to be the fastest growing part of our business in Q4, generating revenue of $296 million, up 23$ year-over-year in constant currency. For the full-year, security revenue exceeded $1 billion and grew 25% over 2019. This puts Akamai, a rare company as few firms generated more than $1 billion in annual revenue from Cyber Security solutions and fewer scale grew at 25% last year. Security represented one third of our revenue last year, which was up from 29% in 2019 and 24% in 2018. Looking to our especially strong Prolexic services Q4 as we helped dozens of major enterprises that span against a wave of ransom DDoS attacks that began in Q3. DDoS production has been the main stay of our portfolio for years and has never been more relevant for customers. We also saw strong bookings for our Bot Manager solution. Bot Manager helps defend against prudential of these attacks which were about four times greater in 2020 than the year before. 2020 was also a strong year for innovation with the release of Page Integrity Manager and Secure Web Gateway. Bookings for both are off to an excellent start as enterprises increasingly need to deal with malware and third-party software and applications and the addition of Secure Web Gateway to our enterprise Enterprise Threat Protector service better positions us to compete in the fast-growing enterprise security market. We were also pleased to close our acquisition of Asavie in Q4, which helps advance our security capabilities for cellular devices and networks. New customers signed Asavie integration including National Health Agency, which adopted Asavie to secure it's COVID vaccination application and Digital Comps, a nonprofit organization that works to close the digital learning gap for students to equitable access and technology. Our media and carrier division also delivered a strong fourth quarter as a result of continued high levels of traffic for OTT video services and downloads of e-gaming software. On November 10, traffic on the Akamai platform reached an all-time of 181 terabits per second, 50% greater than 2019. Nobody in the marketplace comes anywhere close to our capacity to serve customers at the edge on a global scale. In fact, we already exceeded last year's traffic feet just last week. On the application performance side of the business, Q4 was a crucial quarter for e-commerce with major buying events such as Black Friday and Single Day. The unmatched reliability, scale, global reach and security of our Intelligent Edge platform is a major reason why 40 of the world's top 50 retailers and 23 of the top 25 in the US use Akamai to accelerate their commerce applications. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance last year on both the top and bottom lines and I want to thank our employees for enabling Akamai to achieve such strong results as they cope with the challenges of the pandemic. As we look to the future, we see substantial opportunity for enterprises to increase their use of the Akamai Intelligent Edge platform. We believe the Edge is where new applications and new business models will come to life, where intelligence will be built and collected and analyzed, where the promise of 5G and IoT will be realized and where security will provide the online world's first and most important line of defense. To better take advantage of these opportunities and to better serve our customers, we announced today that we'll be realigning our organization around two major groups of products, products that enable business online and products that protect business online. Both product groups will be supported with a single unified sales organization. Products that enable business online will be the focus of our new Edge technology group, which will be led by Adam Karon as COO and General Manager. This group will be responsible for our media delivery, web performance and Edge computing solutions as well the Edge platform that underpins everything we do. These products generate about two thirds of our total revenue today and strong margins and tax generation that fuel our innovation power. The group's mission is twofold; first to ensure that our Edge platform remains the unparalleled market leader for scale, performance, reliability, ease-of-use, agility and cost and second, to generate additional growth of the innovation of new products and services for emerging customer needs in areas such as IoT, 5G and serverless computing. The products that protect business online will come together as a new security technology group to be led by Rick McConnell as President and General Manager. This new group will be responsible for all our security solutions, including our market-leading web security products such Kona Site Defender, Bot Manager and Prolexic. Our enterprise security products such as Enterprise and Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector and our carrier security products such as our DNS space secure business offering and our new secure mobile service from Azioni. In 2021 with go to market with a unified mobile sales organization that better serve our customers, deepen our channel relationships and provide our customers and partners with easier access to the full breadth of our portfolio. PJ Joseph who previously led our sales for media and carrier, will lead global sales reporting to me. As part of the new alignment, Bobby Blumofe will become our Chief Technology Officer to guide innovation and be an evangelist for our technology vision and leadership in the market place. Kim Salem-Jackson who has successfully led Akamai field marketing and global indications for the last three years will become our new Chief Marketing Officer as part of our planned transition. Kim will succeed Monique Bonner who has done a fabulous job at transforming our marketing organization over the last four and years. Mo will stay on with Akamai in senior advisory role, which will allow her to devote time to her family while still ensuring the success of key market initiatives currently underway. You can read more about our organizational announcement in the press release issued today and you'll be able to see directly from our leadership team at our Investor Summit on February 25 and we'll outline our strategy and plans drive Anamai's next phase of growth. Akamai name amazing contributions to the world in 2020, but we believe the best is yet to come. Looking ahead, we have the potential to greatly expand our business and enterprise and carrier security as we strive to further grow our leadership position in web website. We plan to growth the capacity of our unparalleled intelligent Edge platform by another order of magnitude as we continue to improve our market-leading performance and reliability. We seek to bring innovative new services to market to support emerging IoT and serverless computing applications. We want to help enable the world to take advantage of the incredible potential of 5G and we'll continue our efforts to build value for our shareholders with our world-class counter technology leadership, strong profitability and cash generation that fuel our future growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to provide further details on our 2020 results and the Outlook for 2021. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. As Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter in Q4. We were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on revenue and earnings. Q4 revenue was $846 million up 10% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency, driven by another quarter of very strong security growth, higher-than-expected gaming traffic and the weaker US dollar. Revenue from our Web Division was $438 million, up 5% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. Revenue growth for this group of customers was again, led by our Security business. And while we saw a stronger than expected seasonal traffic growth from some of our retail and commerce customers, other customers in this vertical and in our travel and hospitality vertical continue to be negatively impacted by the pandemic. Revenue from our Media and Carrier Division was $408 million, up 15% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency. As noted, we benefited from higher than expected gaming and video traffic along with continued momentum in security. Revenue from the Internet platform customers was $58 million, up 11% from the prior year and above our expectations due to higher-than-expected traffic. Security revenue for the fourth quarter was $296 million, up 24% year-over-year and 23% in constant currency driven by continued global demand across our web security product portfolio and higher-than-expected revenue from our recently closed Asavie acquisition. Asavie we contributed approximately $8 million in Q4, driven by a combination of much-better-than-expected strength in the educational vertical and a faster-than-expected revenue ramp for a recently added carrier in the U.S. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $6 million on a sequential basis and positive $9 million on a year-over-year basis. International revenue was $379 million, up 16% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets represented 45% of total revenue in Q4, up 3 points from Q4 2019 and consistent with Q3 levels. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $467 million up 5% year-over-year. Moving now to costs; cash gross margin was 76% in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 64%, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $280 million, slightly above our guidance in part due to higher sales commissions given the revenue outperformance we saw in Q4. Moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $364 million, a $45 million or 14% from the same period in 2019. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 43%, up 2 points from Q4 2019. Non-GAAP operating income was $256 million, up $34 million or 15% in the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 30%, up 1 point from last year and in line with our guidance. Capital expenditures in Q4 excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $195 million. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $113 million or $0.68 of earnings per diluted share. It is worth noting that our Q4 GAAP results include two one-time items, a $27 million restructuring charge primarily related to the company realignment as Tom mentioned and a $20 million additional endowment to the Akamai Foundation. Non-GAAP net income was $220 million or $1.33 of earnings per diluted share, up 8% year-over-year, up 6% in constant currency, and $0.01 above the high-end of our guidance range due to higher-than-expected revenues. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $39 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of approximately 15%. Now, I will discuss some balance sheet items. As of December 31st, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.5 billion. After accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our two convertible notes, net cash was approximately $197 million as of December 31st. Now, I'll review our use of capital. During the fourth quarter, we spent $73 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 700,000 shares. We ended Q4 with approximately $572 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Our long-term plan remains to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution resulting from equity compensation over time. I'm very proud of all of our employees who delivered these outstanding Q4 and 2020 results, especially during a very challenging year for us all. Now before I provide guidance, I thought it would be helpful to talk about how we see the year unfolding and highlight some key items you may want to consider as you build your models. Our revenue outlook assumes that the pandemic-related impacts to areas like work-from-home and travel will last at least for the first half of 2021. As a result, we expect to see continued challenges in our retail and travel verticals. From a traffic perspective, as life returns to a more normalized pre-pandemic state, we do not expect to see our traffic on our platform decrease. We believe the pandemic has accelerated consumer usage of the Internet in areas like OTT video, gaming, and e-commerce and we believe this usage pattern will likely persist going forward. However, we expect to see traffic continue to grow in 2021, but at a rate more in line with pre-2020 historical levels. In addition to revenue, there are some other items we expect in 2021 that are worth calling out. First, in 2020, our travel and related expenses were much lower than normal. Our guidance assumes that these expenses begin to return to a more normalized level beginning in the second half of 2021. Second, in light of the recent decline in interest rates, we expect our interest income to decline on a year-over-year basis. Specifically, we expect interest income to be about $8 million lower year-over-year, which will have a negative impact of about $0.05 on our non-GAAP earnings per share compared with 2020. Third, I wanted to remind you of the typical seasonality that we experience on the top and bottom lines. In the first quarter, we usually see a revenue step-down sequentially from Q4, our strong seasonal quarter. Also in Q1, remember that our employee payroll taxes and 401(k) matching programs reset. These costs will decline throughout the year as employees begin to max out. Finally, as Tom mentioned earlier, we are reorganizing the company around a product-driven group structure and moving away from the current vertically aligned division structure. In Q1, we will report revenue results under the new edge technology and security technology groups as Tom outlined. The revenue splits will look familiar to you as they align to our current CDN on other and cloud security revenue reporting that we have historically provided. To assist with the transition, we will continue to report web and Media and Carrier Division results on our website for the balance of 2021. And finally, as a result of the reorganization, we expect to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $7 million in Q1. Looking ahead to full-year, we expect revenue of $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion, which is up 4% to 6% year-over-year in constant currency. This outlook assumes that foreign exchange contributes about $45 million on a year-over-year basis. We expect security revenue growth in the range of 18% to 20% over 2020 levels. We also expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%, we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.33 to $5.46. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 15% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. And finally, full-year CapEx is expected to be approximately 16% of revenue. This is down 7 points year-over-year as we expect to leverage the significant network capacity investment we made in 2019 and 2020. Moving on to Q1 guidance. We are projecting Q1 revenue in the range of $822 million to $836 million, or up 5% to 7% in constant currency over Q1 2020. The current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $4 million impact on Q1 revenue compared to Q4 levels and a positive $16 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $265 million to $270 million. We anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of approximately 44%. And now, moving on to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $111 million to $112 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% for Q1. Moving on to CapEx; we expect to spend approximately $150 million to $155 million excluding equity compensation in the first quarter. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.28 to $1.31. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of approximately $37 million to $38 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 15%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. In summary, as you heard Tom highlight, we achieved several significant milestones in 2020 including delivering 11% top-line revenue growth with total revenue exceeding $3 billion for the first time in company history. Growing security revenue 25% and surpassing $1 billion, exceeding our 30% operating margin target, and generating non-GAAP EPS of more than $5 a share. We are very pleased with our performance in 2020 and we believe we're well-positioned for 2021. We look forward to provide any of a deeper look into our business and our plans for the future at our upcoming Investor Summit on February 25th. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. So I guess the big item that crosses my mind is the comment that you're expecting traffic to continue to grow, not really fall off, but at pre-pandemic levels. And given that security is now a bigger part of the mix, I'm kind of curious why the level of deceleration that's factored into the guidance for 2021. Ed McGowan : Hey, Sterling, this is Ed. So I think there's a couple of things you need to think about there. So obviously 2020 was an unusually high traffic year for us. And the point I was trying to make there is that we're not seeing that decline but what we're expecting going into this year is what I'd call, more and more normal traffic year. So you start to get into some tougher compares as you get into Q2 and throughout the rest of the year. And you still have the normal dynamics in the Media business, most of the traffic is coming from media obviously, so there'll be a series of renewals and that's sort of thing which is pretty normal. And then the second thing that we called out is that we are starting to see a bit more pressure in travel and hospitality and retail. The first wave was customers coming to us asking us for extended payment terms, some credits, or some help within a quarter. Now, we're getting into a renewal cycle so we're expecting to see some pressure from that area. And keep in mind that's about 20% of our total business, about 40% of our Web Division, our prior Web Division business, so that's going to going to have a little bit of an impact on us as well. Sterling Auty : That makes a lot of sense. And then, Tom, hey, one for you. The structural changes that you're making to the business, what's the motivation of doing that now? Tom Leighton : Well, I think the time has come to bring all of our security teams together. When we created the current structure five years ago, we didn't really have a Security business to speak of a few million dollars, now it's over $1 billion and we had -- the products there were split among three different groups, the web security group which is most of it, enterprise security, which we've talked a lot about, and carrier security, which is very closely tied to enterprise. And enterprise and carrier getting to a real scale now that we can bring them out of incubation and bring all of our security teams together in a division that just focuses on security. And I think that I'll provide even stronger growth going forward. Also, unifying sales makes sense now. Before we had media sales force that we're selling to customers who are buying media products. We had a web sales force selling to verticals that we're buying web products. So splitting made sense then but now all of our customers buy security. In fact, some of the big media customers are our biggest buyers of security products. And so I think it makes sense to bring the field force together and it's more efficient. So I think the end result is that we will operate more efficiently, we will have a stronger innovation, and continue very strong growth in our security product group. And also on the CDN side of the house, as Ed talked about, we've got some tailwinds there, also some challenges in the commerce and travel vertical. But I think very interesting future growth with areas like IoT, 5G and, serverless computing. And bringing those teams together I think, again will enable us to be more efficient moving forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. I wanted to dig into the restructuring a little bit as well. So the restructuring charge, does that imply that there were some headcount reductions associated with this, and given that sort of the operating margins stay relatively stable for the full year, maybe down a little bit, it seems like you're hiring to offset that. So if you could talk us kind of through -- kind of where are you taking sort of investment away and where are you adding investment, that would be helpful. And then the second part of the question from like a go-to-market or from a customer-facing perspective, what are the customers going to see differently here, are the salespeople going to go in with like a bigger toolset or like what changes from that dynamic? Ed McGowan : Yes, sure, Keith, this is Ed, I'll take the first part. So, yes, we had about a 2% reduction in heads and most of that was due to overlap primarily in the go-to-market area. Obviously, we had two leaders in different regions and things like that. In terms of investments, we added over 500 heads this year, investing in security R&D as a percentage has gone. So I think we've done a really good job of cutting costs and scaling. But it would be invested back into the business. So this is really wasn't about the cost savings initiatives, it was more about better efficiency in tuck-in alignment. So we're keeping margins in that 30% and investing a bit in the business moving forward as well. And as we've said in the past, we think 30% is a pretty good place to be running the business. Tom Leighton : Yes. In terms of the areas we're investing in more because we are and net headcount went up quite a bit last year and will grow again this year despite the current reduction taking place. We're investing in innovation, new products, particularly in the security area, also in our platform, making it more of a programmable platform for our customers with projects such as EdgeWorkers and making it easier for customers to just deploy their code straight on to Akamai. In terms of what the customer sees, they're going to see the same rep they saw before by and large. When we had split the sales force before, it was by vertical, and so when we bring it together, it doesn't mean that there is account breakage per se or that you're going to have a different rep. Now that said, it will be a more efficient management structure. We will have a deeper focus on channel, so it's especially important for our growing security products, particularly in the enterprise and carrier security products. And it will be easier I think for a rep to sell everything than maybe it was before. Now, I think reps were, for example, in media, as I mentioned, selling security products and they were versed in the whole product set. But I think that becomes even easier now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. James Fish : Hey, guys, thanks for the question. I want to pick on a couple of questions that were already asked and get into it in greater detail. So maybe first, the last couple of weeks we've been hearing a little bit tougher pricing on the media delivery side. I mean what can you say about some of the larger renewals took place in the back half of '20 as well as that take place in the first half of '21, especially on the streaming side in some of those new streaming services? Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So I would say in terms of pricing, there is -- in the media side I'm not seeing anything unusual. There's one or two accounts where we've had some competitors get a little bit more aggressive than normal but -- and just as far as '21 goes from a medias perspective, not a ton of renewals, nothing worth calling out that's outside the norm. In the past, I've mentioned when we've had items that I thought was worth calling out, I don't see anything here. Our average contract lengths are between one and two years, so you'll always have a mix, I would say. For the ones that occurred in Q4 in the back half of the year came in where we expected. So no real surprises there. James Fish : Got it. And then obviously a few weeks ago, you announced that updated channel partnerships, specifically on the security side and now today, you're talking about this unified sales organization. Can you guys give us a little bit more color as to how much of the business, especially on security is actually coming from the channel already? And then additionally, how does the greater investment around channel impact the P&L versus the consolidation of the sales structure? Ed McGowan : Yes. So right now, about a third of the business in total goes through the channel. In terms of breaking it down a little bit further, if you think about the six -- for example, Asavie, 100% of that goes through the channel. We believe the enterprise business, more and more of that's going to go through the channel. As far as the split goes between security and content delivery, there'd be a bit more on the content delivery side because we've been in the business a lot longer, it's a bigger percentage of our revenue. But the way to think about it is as we move forward, especially in enterprise, channels will be a much bigger part of our go-to-market strategy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Breen from William Blair. Your line is now open. James Breen : Thanks for taking the question. Just for a spread, I think you said that the EBITDA margin in the first quarter guide were up 44%, but you also talked about some of the payroll expenses and some of the expenses in the year-end being higher in the first quarter. If that's the case, where are you seeing better margins to sort of offset some of this increase in expenses? And then secondly, I think, Tom, you talked about some of your media customers taking more security products. Can you just talk about your total customer base and what you're seeing in terms of customers taking multiple products from you guys across the base? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Yes. So the -- yes, the EBITDA margin was 44%. I think just in general, we've done a good job of scaling our back office and getting leverage out of most of our G&A functions plus we're doing all the stuff we do on the server-side making our servers more efficient, etc. So I just called that out because Q1, we typically have vesting of stock, bonus payouts, etc., so we do tend to see a bit uptick in our operating expenses. But also it's -- you had a very high quarter in Q4 from a commissions perspective. So that sort of normalizes out. So the two kind of offset each other but as you kind of think about your model in Q1, it tends to be a bit high on the OpEx side. As you go forward, then obviously Q4, if we're having a good year, it tends to be a high quarter as well as we head into accelerators from the commission side. Tom Leighton : Yes, and in terms of media customers buying security. Our media customers are the biggest brands out there and they very much need their content stay secure and not have sites deface. They're worried about accounts being taken over, that media accounts, gaming accounts from the account hijackers and that's where our bot management and account protection capabilities are very important. And since these are such large enterprises, they tend to be very large security customers.  When we get together on the 25th, we'll give really a much deeper breakdown into our various security products, how we think about them, their growth rates, and what we are projecting over the next several years in terms of growth. We will also give you updated counts on how many buy how many security products. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Tim Horan : Thanks, guys. Can you give us a sense of last year, how much were volumes on the different business above trend? Do you estimate -- I mean there's a lot of moving parts, any color on that would be helpful. Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So on the traffic side, I would say last year was probably about double what we normally see from a traffic-growth perspective. And then as far as other volumes, obviously, those -- our bookings were pretty much in line with what we expected. And outside of the traffic, there was really nothing that was unusual or worth calling out. Tim Horan : And looking at... Tom Leighton : And one thing is that the attack traffic, the bad guys out there, their volumes were way up across the board. Malicious login attempts, attempts to embed malware, those kinds of things -- DDoS attacks, huge increases really across the board last year. And so that course makes a big difference for Akamai to be able to help our customers because we're unique at being able to stop the largest denial of service attacks and being able to stop the account hijacking attacks. Tim Horan : And did term and volume or didn't, sorry, did volume price discounts kick-in as a result of volumes being so strong? Ed McGowan : So it depends on the contract. A lot of big media companies do have tiered pricing, so that would have kicked in but again, nothing unusual other than the fact that just traffic was just much higher than we had expected. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. Two questions, one is, we're getting a lot of questions just in terms of what the company is likely to guide to at the upcoming Analyst Day. Obviously not asking for the numbers themselves, but what are, from a financial perspective, your intentions in terms of what you're going to provide at the Analyst Day? And then secondly, as it relates to your guidance for 2021, your security growth of 18% to 20%, I think it's below to I think what had been message more of a go for a plus 20%. Is there anything to kind of flag there, is that just typical conservatism, is this simply the law of large numbers as we now breach that $1 billion, or do you think if there is an opportunity to kind of accelerate that or re-accelerate that growth again? Thank you. Ed McGowan : Yes, So I'll take the second part first. It is a bit of the law of large numbers I guess, we're getting much bigger. We do have a lot of newer products that are ramping fast but it just takes a while on a recurring revenue business. I think if you go back and look in the past, we've talked about last year getting to $1 billion, we exceeded that the year before that, mid-20s, we did high-20s. So there is always a possibility to overachieve but I think that's a reasonable guide. The other question was on the intentions of what we are going to talk about at the Analyst Day. As far as 2021 guidance, so it's only a two-week, so I'm not going to see anything different that I haven't seen yet. So I don't anticipate updating guidance from what we just talked about now. But what we will do is get into a lot more detail, you'll hear from all the leaders talking about what's the different groups and what they're going to be working on some of the growth dynamics, we'll be exposing a lot more about what's going on within the security buckets. We'll be showing you different growth rates and different products, so I think there's a lot of good information that will come out. But in terms of updating guidance, there won't be any [indiscernible], just given that it's two weeks from today. Colby Synesael : So, no, I think of -- I'll go back to your Analyst Day I think, it might have been in 2018, there was a talk about that 30% operating margin. No expectation to give a new bogey, if you will, for a few years out from there. Ed McGowan : No, we're not going to give a new bogey for new operating margin. What I will do is talk about the dynamics of the different businesses and how over time, you can see margins expand if we get to the -- a greater percentage of our business comes from security. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Great, thanks so much for taking the questions. If there has been some -- so much pent-up demand on the gaming side, and it seems like gaming was a strong contributor again this quarter, how should we think about the impact the gaming vertical might have in 2021 versus maybe other console launches in the past? Ed McGowan : Yes, you're right, it was a very strong quarter for gaming. And for us again, just as a reminder we work with the publishers, as well as the major platform. So the upside coming from a variety of different customers. It's, -- we're seeing more interest in gaming the console releases drove a lot of upside in the quarter. It's always hard to predict what games are going to be popular and there is a bit of seasonality in gaming depending on a quarter that has many releases versus one that may not have as many. But it's a very fast-growing vertical for us and we expect that with these new consoles, there should be some new demand throughout the year. Brad Zelnick : Great, that's very helpful, and maybe just a follow-up on a different topic, Ed. As we think about the zero-overage plans you put in place within the Web Division and the strong e-commerce holiday season, what might the impact have been, and is this a model, which you might expect to be more pervasive throughout your customer base as we move into 2021 and beyond? Ed McGowan : Yes, good question. So, as you know, we introduced this probably about 20 months ago is that the number of our customer conference back in and I think it was June of '19, and we have gotten a lot of traction mostly in retail, that's where we're seeing most of the requests for that type of structure. We're right now -- we've got over half of our customers in the commerce vertical are adopting that structure and it makes a lot of sense. It's actually a good strategy when you're faced with a customer base to discuss the macroeconomic challenges when you're looking at ways of getting -- saving money or getting more predictable spend. So it's been well received by the customer base, I would imagine that will continue to tick up. It's not for everyone and like I said, we've seen the primary adopter of that is in the retail space. Brad Zelnick : Awesome. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Power from Baird. Your line is now open. Will Power : Okay, great. Yes, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to come back to security, I'd love to try to get a little more color on Page Integrity. I know you've been seeing strong trends there for a while, is that on path to be $100 million product and anything else you can share there? And I guess the second piece that ties into that, just wanted to get an update on what you're seeing in terms of revenue, bookings, etc. for some of that enterprise products? Tom Leighton : Yes, I'll take those. Page Integrity Manager is off to a great start. We had really very good bookings. Now, of course, we just got launched middle of last year, so it will take time to grow into a $100 million business, but that's very exciting for us. And in terms of bookings for the enterprise business, again, very strong. And as you know, we've been looking forward to getting our enterprise and carrier security products to the point where they are $100 million revenue and we think that we can do that this year, at least get on that run rate so that combined with the enterprise and carrier security now that we have Asavie on-board, and we're going to talk a lot more about that at the upcoming Analyst Day. Will Power : Are there any particular areas within the enterprise component where you're seeing particular strength? Tom Leighton : It's across the board, Enterprise Application Access, really important because of all the malicious login attempts. Enterprise Threat Protector with SolarWinds becomes more important than ever to know what employee devices and enterprise devices are talking to, are they trying to contact command and control outside the enterprise, that's something that we can help catch and stop. Asavie has done incredibly well, much better than we'd expected post-acquisition. And, for example, things like students that need to gain access for remote learning, to protect them to make sure that their environment is secure, there is a -- been a lot of development, of course, we have carriers there. They sell this product and we're behind the scenes, but a very strong pickup there to secure the enterprise cellular networks. And then you think about IoT, in the future, all those devices have to be secured and probably all going to be connected with 5G. So I think a lot of potential upside there. And our secure business solution that's resolved by major carriers under their brands for small and media business -- medium business, again doing very well. So I would say across the board with the enterprise and carrier products, very strong growth and we might have a good chance of doubling revenue this year and reaching $100 million. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. Jeff Van Rhee : Great, thanks, two from me. Tom, just in terms of restructuring, I'm just curious sort of the thought process or the history of the thought process there. How long this has been percolating and if there were, as you think about it, kind of one or two key triggers that really made this the time? And then secondly, very high level. You look at the 11% annual growth, a lot of puts and takes as it relates to COVID but to the extent you can dial it in, what do you think growth would have been ex-COVID impacts, so obviously pro and con, but any color there? Tom Leighton : Yes, we've been thinking about rework along these lines for really an extended period. It's something the senior management team would discuss at least on an annual basis. And in terms of the trigger, now our security business has reached $1 billion and that's an important milestone. We are also seeing really strong growth for the enterprise and carrier security products, as I mentioned, and they were both in incubation phase and in different parts of the company. We have the enterprise group had the enterprise security products and for the carrier products that was done in the Media and Carrier Division. And of course, most of security revenue was in the Web Division. And increasingly as the smaller product areas grew, you start to have overlap, for example, anybody the buys Asavie, we want to sell them Kona Site Defender, makes perfect sense. Same thing for enterprise security, if you buy EAA, we want Kona. And so I think it really makes sense now, they've reached critical mass to bring them together into one team focused on security. And as I mentioned, with the sales organization is something we have thought about over the last couple of years, certainly more efficient to have a single sales organization and the advantage of having them be split had disappeared really once all our customers are buying really all our products, but certainly security. So again, the time is right to do it and you don't like doing something in the middle of the pandemic, but at the same time, you can't wait. At Akamai, we always had a sense of urgency, we want to get this done because I think it will help our growth going forward. Now in terms of 11%, we are very pleased to see that this year. We definitely got some tailwinds for overall traffic levels and so the Media and Carrier Division did well, we also deployed a ton of capacity for, as Ed mentioned, increased growth this year and next year, just the rate of growth probably less this year and next year, more like normal traffic increases as opposed to twice that, that we experienced this year. I think we got hurt in revenue in our web performance products, as Ed talked about. A big part of their revenue comes from commerce which has gotten -- most commerce companies have really been pounded with COVID. There's a few big names that have done very well, probably picked up business. The amount of commerce going online has increased dramatically but when the parent company is hurting, that creates a more difficult environment to negotiate a contract. And in many cases, as we've talked about, we worked with the customer to give them some relief and on pricing as well, we've gone to zero-overage so they can plan better and that hurt I think, revenue with this past Q4, we don't get a lot of bursting. On the other hand, it preserves that business more for us in long term and we're in this for the long haul. And it means we aren't going to share that business with the many competitors out there, who would like to have just a tiny piece of our commerce business. And so it seems a little paradoxical that on the one hand, it probably hurt us on revenue on the other, as we talked about, we serve 40 of the global 50 leaders in commerce and retail and 23 of 25 in the U.S. and we're working very hard to maintain that business over the long-term and grow it, particularly with our security products. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open. Brandon Nispel : Great, thank you. Two questions for Ed. Ed, could you provide the contribution from acquired businesses included in the revenue outlook for 2021, I think in particular around Asavie and then Inverse? And then secondly, how should we think about IPC revenue contribution in 2021 versus 2020? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So as far as Inverse goes, there's really no revenue, that was a very small company. It was more of a tech tuck-in some of the others that we've done in the past. So there is no real contribution from that directly. As we integrated and it will help accelerate some of our other products. Asavie, probably about $30 million incremental, if you look kind of year-over-year, we had about $8 million this quarter. So somewhere in that range, so call it a little less than a point. And then as far as the Internet platform customers, I'm not going to tip my cap for the team that's been working on those, they have done a fantastic job not only maintaining that business but growing it. I haven't provided specific guidance, but I'd expect kind of a similar year where you're kind of maintain where you're kind of, maintaining where you are at, maybe a little upside. Q4 was particularly strong, so maybe it's in that $50 million range, plus or minus a few million bucks depending on what's going on in a particular quarter. Brandon Nispel : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Rishi Jaluria : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions, and nice to see continued strong execution. I wanted to go back to an earlier comment that was made with reference to SolarWinds bridge. I wanted to get a sense, what are you seeing out there in terms of any changes in demand or pipeline or inbound interest as a result of that breach, especially given your kind of leadership in the zero-trust area that's becoming increasingly important for CSO. And then I've got a follow-up. Tom Leighton : Yes, obviously it illustrates the importance of zero-trust. It's -- it was obviously a devastating attack and it highlights the need for products, for example, like our Enterprise Threat Protector. It's one thing to try to stop the malware from getting inside, that's hard, you look at an example like this, but once it inside, it has to go out and contact command to control. And that's something that you can pick up in detect and block in many cases and then alert the CSO that they got a problem. And that's what our Enterprise Threat Protector product is meant to do and has done in many, many cases. So I think in the long run, it just heightens the need for products that we provide and the need for zero-trust in general. Stepping up a level, with third party malware showing up everywhere, that's the same problem you have with page integrity and why our Page Integrity Manager service is so important. Because today so many websites linked to third parties or use third-party or open-source code, it has malware. And what that means is when a client or one of our users goes to their website or uses their app, the client gets infected and their personal information's exposed. And it's just another example of a third-party malware that's become infected that the enterprise is using. A different particular use case, one is the web side the others internal enterprise apps, same problem and same devastating result and Akamai has solutions to help stop that. Rishi Jaluria : Got it, that's helpful. And then I wanted to go back to the reorg. Look, I think it makes a lot of sense why you're doing the reorg, maybe philosophically, want to understand what steps are you taking or how are you thinking about avoiding disruption because in enterprise software, every time there is a reorg, there's always a worry of it's going to disrupt the business, especially when you're running on such a hot hand like you are right now and you've done reorgs in the past. So maybe kind of a thought process on just how do you avoid that from really disrupting our business would be helpful. Thanks. Tom Leighton : Yes, that's a great question, something we've put a lot of time and effort into. This is a kind of thing we would plan for, really for six months. It's important to know we're doing it from a position of strength. I think the last thing you want to do is a reorg when you're in a position of weakness because that's where you can get the disruption in the problems. And as you can see, we're as strong as we've ever been. And so I think that is a good time to do a reorg. As we mentioned before, I don't see a lot of account disruption, not a lot of account breakage. You do worry whenever you change, the go-to-market operation, that you could have some disruption that way. I don't think that's likely here because as we mentioned, a lot of the accounts have the same person they had before that they're dealing with. So I don't think that will be a problem for us. And as you mentioned, we do have experience at doing this and we have great employees and I would say morale in the company is very high. And so I don't anticipate serious disruptions in the business here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Majek from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Robert Majek : Great, thanks. I think investors appreciate the sales synergies between your web performance offerings in your cloud security offerings and the sales force consolidation there makes perfect sense but would be great to get your thoughts on whether or not it still makes sense to build a dedicated sales force to help accelerate your enterprise security adoption. Tom Leighton : Yes, we do have a sales specialist already and that has been maintained with the new organization. So there'll be no change there in terms of the specialist for not only the enterprise security products but the carrier security products, which are very close. Also, Prolexic has sales specialists there, so that won't change. Robert Majek : Great, thanks and one more if I can, just building up Brad's questions. The year-over-year CDN growth rate decelerated 4 points from last quarter. So just wondering what we should make that dynamic. We know that overall traffic especially around gaming with strong, up -- perhaps it was offset by the introduction Zero Overage Fixed Fee pricing. So any additional clarification there would be helpful as we think about CDN and growth rate going forward. Ed McGowan : Yes, I think you pretty much nailed it. I just remember last Q4 was an exceptionally strong quarter from a traffic growth perspective. So you've got a bit of a tougher compare and like I said earlier, starting in Q2, when we saw the big ramp in traffic, you're going to start to see a little bit tougher compare on the media side and then the dynamics that we've talked about really over last couple of quarters on the retail and commerce vertical, make it a bit more of a challenging year from a CDN perspective, but we still think we're in a great position and we've got some really good tailwinds going on. We were just talking a minute ago, OTT video is also growing very strongly. So there's a lot of puts and takes in there, but in general, I think that's kind of the key driver is just a bit of a tougher compare and then that challenge with retail and travel. Tom Barth : Okay, well, this is Tom Barth. We want to thank everyone in closing. As Tom and Ed mentioned, we would look forward to you joining us virtually for our Investor Relations Summit on February 25th. Additionally, we will be presenting at several investor conferences and events throughout the rest of the quarter. Details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Thank you for joining us, and all of us here at Akamai wish continued good health to you and yours and have a wonderful evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you Please go ahead, Sir. Tom Barth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining Akamai's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. The factors include uncertainty stemming from COVID-19 pandemic and any impact from unexpected geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 4, 2021. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks Tom. And thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent results in the first quarter. Q1 revenue was $843 million, up 10% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency. This strong result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security business, accelerated growth in our edge applications business and continued high traffic levels on our intelligent edge platform. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 31% and Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $1.38 per diluted share, up 15% year-over-year and up 11% in constant currency. With a strong start to 2021, we're proud that Akamai has continued to enable and to protect, remote work, homeschooling, ecommerce and online entertainment for billions of people around the world amidst very challenging circumstances. Our security solutions portfolio performed especially well in Q1 generating revenue of $310 million, up 29% year-over-year and up 27% in constant currency. A very strong growth was experienced across most of our security products, including our new Page Integrity Manager solution. Page Integrity Manager helps enterprises defend against malware and third-party software and applications. Customers that adopted Page Integrity Manager in Q1 included Maersk, the world's largest container shipping operator, and Groupon, the global e commerce marketplace. Maersk uses more than 4000 scripts, half of which are third party scripts to drive millions of dollars of online business every hour. Managing this complex and dynamic environment had become an increasingly difficult security challenge for Maersk and so they now use Page Integrity Manager to improve visibility into security threats and to prevent the loss of critical data. Our Bot Manager solution also continued to perform very well in Q1. Bot Manager is designed to mitigate a wide variety of automated attacks, including account stuffing attacks where credentials stolen from one website are checked for validity at 1000s of other websites. When valid credentials are found a manual attack is then often used to extract value from the compromised accounts. Losses from account takeovers and new account fraud are estimated at over $10 billion annually in the US. In order to afford such manual attacks. We launched the beta for our new account protector solution in Q1. Account protector shields organizations from account takeover and other kinds of fraudulent human activity without increasing friction for legitimate customers. Account protector works by detecting in real time whether a user logging into an application is the legitimate account owner or an imposter in possession of stolen credentials. One of our beta customers for this new solution is a well-known restaurant franchise that was under attack by cyber criminals who were compromising the loyalty accounts of their diners. The criminals were stealing loyalty reward points and then reselling them on the dark web. The digital theft outraged the diners whose points were stolen and angered restaurant owners who unknowingly provided meals to fraudsters. With help from Akamai, the franchise can now identify the situations where humans are impersonating valid diners, and take action to stop the illicit transfer of loyalty points, thereby stopping the fraud and enabling the franchise to focus on accelerating sales. We're also excited about the success of Akamai's fastest growing security segment Access Control, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $100 million in Q1, up more than 170% over Q1 of 2020 and up over 60% organically. Our Access Control segment provides secure connectivity for users, applications, workloads and IoT systems, regardless of their location. Products in this area include enterprise application access, enterprise threat protector, and our new secure mobile and secure IoT solutions that we acquired from Asavie in October. Our secure mobile and secure IoT products provide security, visibility and control for mobile devices at the edge. These services determine malicious activity and support acceptable use policies without needing to install a client on the device. The solutions are sold to our carrier partners such as AT&T, where it forms the basis for their AccessMyLAN solution. These capabilities have been especially important in helping school districts secure student devices during the pandemic so that students can learn from home safely. Our security solutions also continued to gain recognition from the leading analyst firms in Q1. Our market leading web application firewall capabilities, earned Gartner peer insights customers choice distinction, and Forrester named Akamai as a leader in DDoS protection for the third time, saying large enterprise clients that want an experienced trusted vendor to make their DDoS problem go away should look to Akamai. Turning to our CDN portfolio, Q1 marked another quarter of very strong traffic growth for Akamai, led by OTT video services and downloads of e-gaming software. On March 16, traffic on the Akamai platform reached an all-time high of 200 terabits per second. This is 19% higher than the peak and Q1 of last year, and two and a half times the traffic peak in Q1 of 2019. Daily peaks were also high in Q1, averaging 143 terabits per second. In fact, traffic on our platform exceeded 110 terabits per second, pretty much around the clock in Q1. Overall, our CDN products and services generated revenue of $532 million in Q1 of 2% year-over-year and flat in constant currency. The Edge application segment generated 45 million in revenue last quarter, up more than 30% over Q1 of 2020. As you may recall from the discussion at our Investor Summit in February, this revenue amount includes edge computing solutions, such as EdgeWorkers that we build discreetly, but does not include the wide array of services that use our computing capabilities at the edge. As we discussed during our recent Investor Summit, we believe that there's the potential for substantial future growth in the area of edge computing, as we anticipate more enterprises moving their compute workloads to our edge platform for offload, improved performance, security and global scale. A timely example of such a shift is manifested in our new Vaccine Edge solution, which is enabling over two dozen public health agencies and pharmacy chains around the world to deliver and secure COVID vaccine registration sites in the face of extraordinary flash crowds. In multiple instances, Akamai was called in to rescue government agencies whose websites had crashed under load, resulting in frustrated citizens who waited for long times before getting kicked out without a reservation. In some cases, these websites have been using solutions provided by competitors that were not able to handle the load. We're pleased to partner on Vaccine Edge with salesforce.com. And we're proud that our EdgeWorkers solution has made a real difference to the many millions of citizens trying to get the vaccine as quickly as possible. Our customers are now using EdgeWorkers for a wide range of applications. For example, a leading theme park operator is using EdgeWorkers to help manage demand as they plan to reopen parks. A publicly traded sports and entertainment company has implemented GEO fencing, using our EdgeKV data store together with EdgeWorkers to ensure that users access only relevant broadcast content for their location. A nationwide home improvement retailer and a global credit card company are using AB Testing logic at the edge to deliver fast and personalized user experiences. We're enabling DevOps workflows for a global sportswear brand by managing canary releases, where only a targeted group of users can see a new experience. And we're enabling a leading global manufacturer of devices to authenticate their users at the edge, which improves performance and reduces their cloud costs. We're also proud of the progress that we're making with our sustainability efforts. In the past year, we doubled our platform capacity, with no increase at all in our platform's carbon footprint. And just two weeks ago on Earth Day, we announced that by 2030, Akamai intends to power 100% of our global operations with renewable energy, improve the energy efficiency of our platform by an additional 50%, mitigate 100% of our platform emissions and continue to recycle 100% of our electronic waste. These goals reflect optimized commitment to be a responsible, efficient and forward-looking company. In summary, we're very excited about the innovative technology that we're developing, the strong demand from customers for our security and edge computing solutions and our Q1 financial performance on both the top and bottom lines. The growth strategy and goals that we outlined to you in our Investor Summit on February 25 set our direction for the future. And we believe that our strong Q1 results show that we've been executing according to plan. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to provide further details on our Q1 results, and the outlook for next quarter and 2021. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. Before I provide additional details on our Q1 performance, I'd like to remind everyone that as a result of the reorganization we announced last quarter, we've refocused the company from a vertical aligned divisional structure to a product-oriented lens. I will therefore be focusing my discussion today on our security technology group and our edge technology group. The security group, as you might imagine, encompasses all of our security solution. The edge group includes our media delivery, and web performance CDN business, along with our edge compute solutions. We plan to provide additional revenue detail for the different product lines within our security technology group and edge technology group on an annual basis. However, we might highlight specific subgroup details from time to time on our quarterly earnings calls if we feel it will help provide greater context on our results. Finally, as I mentioned on our last call, we will continue to report both web division and media and carrier division results along with our internet platform customer results on our website for the balance of 2021 to assist with this reporting transition. So with all that said, as Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter in Q1. We were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on both revenue and earnings. Q1 revenue was $843 million, up 10% year-over-year, or 8% in constant currency, driven by continued strength across most major product areas in our security business, better than expected traffic from OTT video and gaming customers and very strong performance in our edge applications business. Revenue from our security technology group was $310 million, up 29% year-over-year, or 27% in constant currency, driven by broad based strength across most of our security products. Revenue from our edge technology group was $532 million, up 2% year-over-year, or flat and constant currency. We benefited from strong traffic growth driven by OTT video and gaming, as well as strong growth in our edge applications business as Tom mentioned earlier. As expected, foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $3 million on a sequential basis, and positive $16 million on a year-over-year basis. International revenue was $380 million, up 13% year-over-year, or 8% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets represented 45% of total revenue in Q1 up one point from Q1 2020 and consistent with Q4 levels. Finally, revenue from our US market was $463 million, up 8% year-over-year. Moving now to costs, cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $267 million in line with our expectations. Now moving on to profitability, adjusted EBITDA was $375 million, up $49 million, or 15% from the same period in 2020. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45%, up two points from Q1 2020. Non-GAAP operating income was $264 million, up $34 million, or 15% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 31%, up one point from Q1 last year and above our guidance range due to leverage from our revenue out performance. Capital expenditures in Q1 excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $150 million, consistent with our guidance range. We continue to expect Q1 CapEx to represent the high watermark for quarterly CapEx spending in 2021. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $156 million or $0.94 of earnings per diluted share. Our Q1 GAAP results include a $7 million restructuring charge related to the company realignment we announced last quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP net income was $228 million, or $1.38 of earnings per diluted share, up 15% year-over-year, up 11% in constant currency and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance range due to our revenue outperformance. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $38 million based on a Q1 effective tax rate of approximately 14%. Now, I will discuss some balance sheet items. As of March 31, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.5 billion. After accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our two convertible notes, net cash was approximately $154 million as of March 31. Now I will review our use of capital. During the first quarter we spent $58 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 600,000 shares. We ended Q1 with approximately $514 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Our plan remains to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution resulting from equity compensation over time. As a result based on current market conditions, we expect to spend at least $350 million for the full year 2021. Moving on to Q2 guidance, we are projecting Q2 revenue in the range of $839 million to $853 million, or up 6% to 7% as reported or 3% to 5% in constant currency over Q2 2020. There are two factors to consider, as you think about year-over-year comparisons for Q2. First, in 2020, we saw a significant uptick in traffic on our network starting at the end of March and continuing through the remainder of the year as a result of global lock downs. As our excellent Q1 results demonstrate traffic has continued to grow on our network this year. But we don't expect to see the same traffic growth rates from a year ago going forward. This creates more challenging year-over-year comparisons for our edge delivery business starting in Q2 and continuing for the remainder of 2021. Second, the Q2 year-over-year growth comparison also reflects the continuing ban of some Chinese based apps in India. As a reminder, these apps which were banned in Q3 of last year contributed revenue of approximately $15 million in Q2 2020. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $3 million impact on Q2 revenue compared to Q1 levels and a positive $18 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $261 million to $266 million. We anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of approximately 45%. Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $116 million to $117 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31% for Q2. Moving on to CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $133 million to $138 million, excluding equity compensation in the second quarter. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.40. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $37 million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 14%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we are raising our guidance for both revenue and EPS. We now expect revenue of $3.4 billion to $3.435 billion, which is up 6% to 7% year-over-year as reported or up 5% to 6% in constant currency. We now expect security growth to be in the low 20s for the full year 2021. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% to 31% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.45 and $5.52. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 14% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. Moving on to CapEx, full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 16% of revenue, unchanged from our prior outlook. We are very pleased to have delivered such strong results in Q1 and to be able to increase our outlook for the full year. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Michael on for Colby. Two questions, if I may. First, can you give us an update on your M&A pipeline for security and how the number of opportunities you're seeing compares to this time last year? And secondly one of your CDN peers flagged that they saw loss of market share due to performance. Is there anything that you can flag related to market share gains, or potentially losses during the quarter? That'd be helpful. Thank you. Tom Leighton : Sure, I would say the M&A pipeline is comparable to last year. There's a lot of companies for sale and the pricing for typical companies in the security area remains very high. And I think in many cases unrealistic. So I think overall, the dynamics there are pretty comparable to where they were last year. As you know, Akamai is always looking for opportunities. We're also very disciplined in terms of actually what we end up buying. In terms of CDN market share the very large media companies do compare the CDN vendors in terms of their traffic share. And if a vendor is doing better than others, they tend to get more share. And that's why Akamai has such a large share when it comes to delivery of media traffic. And if a vendor has outages or is performing poorly, which we see a fair amount out there among our competition, they can lose share. And so that's a very typical dynamic, nothing new there. It's been that way for several years. And that's why Akamai such an effort to have the world's best performance hence why we have so much of the traffic. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : Hey, guys, congrats on the quarter. First, can you just give us more color behind the media CDN business in terms of especially the gaming verticals specifically? Just really trying to understand how fast either revenue or traffic from gaming itself is growing and what the exposure to gaming overall, given what we're seeing with the console cycle, as well. And then normally Ed, you don't typically raising Q - following Q1, I guess what gives you the confidence at this point of the year versus normal? Ed McGowan : Yeah. Hey Jim, so first, I'll take the first question, which was around the media, the gaming growth in particular. So we don't break out specific growth rates. But I can say that gaming in particular was one of the stronger verticals in terms of growth, very pleased with what we saw. And the other thing is, I'd say, the names of the number of customers that we saw growing, it wasn't just your normal handful of gaming customers. So we saw some benefit from the continuation of the gaming console releases we saw in Q4, but we also saw a lot of publishers have some pretty significant releases during the quarter. So in general, it's a really good gaming quarter. We're off to a pretty good start here in Q2. And as you know, this the gaming release can be a bit seasonal, but so far, it's been a pretty good start for the year. Like I said, I'm pretty happy with the performance across many different customers. In terms of guidance, yeah, we just started off having a great year. Traffic has been very strong. You saw the security performance, it's a little bit - we get a lot of exposure on the FX side. So having one quarter down and having the first month of the quarter of the - or second quarter down, gives a little bit more confidence going into the year. So we felt that we had enough visibility at this point to raise guidance. As you know, the second half of the year is always a little bit more challenging where Q3 is embassy summer seasonality, we didn't see that last year, because of the pandemic, we'll probably see a little bit of that on the media side. And then Q4 obviously, tends to be our strongest seasonal quarter where you have strong ecommerce and strong media. So we're feeling pretty confident at this point. So we thought it was appropriate to take the guidance up a touch. James Fish : Thanks, congrats again. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent, thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. On the last question and this kind of increased confidence in the year, is it more on the like CDN side or more on the security side, because it does sound like you feel good about some of those new products ramping pretty nicely on the security portfolio, and you're talking about the low 20s growth for the year. So I was hoping you could clarify that and then have a follow up question on margins if we have time. Tom Leighton : Yeah, we had a very strong start to the year. It's great to see the security business growing at 29%. And as we talked about, it's really across the board. It's not a single product doing well, but just strength everywhere in security. And when you see that kind of performance and we look ahead to the back part of the year, we are confident that we're going to do better than we had thought coming into the year, just great performance. There's also good performance on the CDN side, happy to see that up 2%. As I'd talked about you do worry about FX there and what can happen, but on balance business very strong and off to a great start. Ed, do you want to add any color to that? Ed McGowan : No, I think you covered it, Tom. I think seeing the strength of security to be able to take that up a touch and last quarter we were in the 18% to 20% range. Now we're in the low 20s. And then on the CDN side, we do have some tougher compares. But we're seeing really strong traffic and not seeing any decrease from what we've seen over the last year. So we're feeling pretty good about that. Keith Weiss : Got it, that sounds great. And then on the margin side of the equation, we're past the peak in terms of CapEx, sort of spending or CapEx intensity. But it's going to take some time for that to flow through to gross margins, so there's probably more like a calendar '22 impact. But you did come in a little bit ahead on operating margins this quarter and next quarter, we're looking for 31%. The expectation that you're going to try to sort of take that up with increased investment in the business or is there potential for kind of more flow through upside into better margins for the year. Ed McGowan : Yeah. So Keith, two things to think about there, the first one is, we have our - biggest expense lies our payroll, and we have our annual, what we call our merit increase cycle that kicks in July 1. So you'll see a little bit of increase in our operating expenses for carrying our current employees, but we will be investing in security. So we plan - we've got some planned investments in the back half of the year. But we took the guidance range up from what we said approximately 30 last time to 31. So running a 31 here would be to touch under and in Q3 as we go through our merit cycle and then Q4 is always a little bit of a wild card in terms of how strong the revenue performance is. But we want to make sure we're investing back in the business, we see really good growth in security, but also in our edge applications business as well. Keith Weiss : Is there a potential for gross margins to start to become a little bit of a tailwind into the back half of the year? Ed McGowan : Yeah, I mean, you got to keep in mind, the mix there. Overtime, I think, as you get into - as we talked about, in the Investor Relations Day, where you saw our security margins, gross margins are higher, you've got your media margins are lower. So it really is a mix. And while we're exceeding our plan so far on security, it's going to take a bit for that to really manifest itself in higher gross margins. You see we get a bigger percentage of the business coming from security. And if you look at the part of the business in media that's growing primarily the high-volume video, high volume media, that tends to be where you have the most competition and pricing pressure. So you kind of balance those two out and you kind of keep the margin - gross margins, flattish here for the year and then I'd say overtime there's a chance that we could see some expansion there, but we're not going to call that out right now. Keith Weiss : Got it. Excellent. Thank you so much for the color guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Rajat on for Sterling Auty. Can you give colors on the organic growth in the security for the quarter? Ed McGowan : Yeah. Sure. This is Ed. We had about $10 million of contribution from Asavie, which would be about four percentage points. I would say though, that when we acquired Asavie, our plan was to do roughly 30 million in revenue in the first year. And we're obviously exceeding that. So we've been able to take that asset and really start to scale it. So while it's technically inorganic, I'd say we deserve some credit for being able to significantly accelerate that growth rate. So you back out the 4%, you'd be - it's at 29 to be 25 and 22% on a constant currency basis. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, and then just a follow-up on that, like the gross margins in sales and marketing are down seasonally, so can you give colors on that also? Ed McGowan : Yeah, so on the sales and marketing, what you'll find is Q4 tends to be our highest quarter for sales and marketing expenses where you have - especially last year when we were exceeding our plan to get into accelerator, so you get a reset on the compensation and you'll see it spike up again in Q4 of this year. Unidentified Analyst : Cool and on gross margins. Ed McGowan : Yeah, so gross margins were flat quarter-over-quarter. That's in line with what we expected. So really, there's nothing to call out there. Unidentified Analyst : Cool, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Tim Horan : Thanks guys, great, security quarter. Was there any one-time items, any license deals or anything else that would suggest why the growth has slowed down so much after an acceleration like this? And can you comment on how enterprise security is doing? Is it meeting your expectations at this point? Ed McGowan : Yeah. Sure. Tim, I'll take the first one and Tom if you want to talk about enterprise afterwards. So yeah, there's - there was really nothing to call out in terms of license revenue. But I'm glad you reminded me because when you guys are building your model, if you remember last year in Q2, we did have an unusually strong license quarter. So as you kind of build your models and look at your competitors, just remember last year, we had 7 million of license revenue in Q2. We don't expect that again in Q2 of this year. And in Q1, there was really nothing unusual. As Tom said, there's really strength across many different products in security. It's been easy for us to just call out one thing, but the good news for us as we've seen strength everywhere. And Tom I don't know if you want to talk a bit about the enterprise. Tom Leighton : Yeah, the access segment performed very well. As we noted, we're now at $100 million revenue run rate. So it's great to start the year in Q1 there, very strong growth, over 170% over last year. Now of course that includes Asavie. If you take that out, organic growth still over 60% in that segment, so very pleased. And as Ed noted, we're pretty excited about the Asavie acquisition, especially as you get the emergence of 5G and you get IoT applications, but the ability to secure enterprise devices across the board, I think is very exciting for the future. And we're really in a unique position to do that. And we have great relationships with the carrier. So we think we'll really be able to scale that business to a global basis. Tim Horan : And just following up on the M&A question, with new security products, do you think you can shift more to internal development from your own R&D as opposed to acquisitions? Or how has that been trending the last few years? Tom Leighton : I think it's a good healthy mix. As you know, we've made several acquisitions, mostly tech tuck ins, occasionally something a little bit larger. And we do a lot of organic investment in research and development, very active, they're very innovative. Maybe a good example is Page Integrity Manager, which we launched last year, and doing really well in the marketplace. And we did - that was a blend of a tech tuck in about seven to 10 employees in the company we acquired and a lot of organic development at the same time to make a very successful product quickly bring it to market and very strong adoption in early days. Tim Horan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Mike Cikos : Hey, guys. Here's Mike Cikos on the line here for Alex Henderson. Could you comment on the security growth you're experiencing? I'm just trying to, I guess, think about this demand and the increased expectations you guys have now. Is any of this at all related to, I guess budges finally coming to market following the headlines that we saw earlier in the year round SolarWinds and the Microsoft Exchange Server hack? And then there's the second comment on that would be the improved outlook that you have for security, is it also expected to be broad based on a go forward basis? Tom Leighton : Yeah, let me take the first question there. And that's a yeah, really good question. The attack landscape is just breathtaking. You think you've seen it all and then next week, you read the next headline, the in the attackers are very powerful. You have nation states, large scale, organized crime just - and what they're doing is pretty scary. Now, the great news for Akamai and our customers is that we have solutions that can protect enterprises for a large majority of those attacks. A great example is the recent Exchange Server hack, where many 1000s of enterprises got hacked, lost their emails, which is really bad. Akamai, our IT department was running an Exchange Server, just like all those other companies. And the difference is we didn't get hacked because we use our own enterprise security solutions. And we had enterprise application access, sitting in front of our Exchange Server. And that meant that the vulnerability couldn't be exploited. Because the employee doesn't just get to go contact the Exchange Server they did, then somebody can come in and before you're authenticated by the Exchange Server, you can exploit the vulnerability. Instead, they got to get to Akamai \u2013they come to Akamai's enterprise application access product, we authenticate them. And if it's a bad guy outside trying to do something, no way they get in and not only that, they don't get directly to the Exchange Server, because they have to pass through our security. So if they're trying to do bad things, we'll stop it. And it's all about our approach to zero trust. And yes, we can protect enterprises from these sorts of things. And even in zero-day attacks, we didn't know about the exchange hack before other enterprises or Microsoft did, and yet we were protected at zero-day because of our solutions. So I think as the attacks increase that does increase awareness and that does help drive our security business. And I see no end to the attacks coming. There's more on the way and we're in a great position to be able to help the leading enterprises stay safe against those attacks. Mike Cikos : Great and then just following up that broad based strength that we're talking to Q1, is that expected on a go forward basis with the updated outlook we have today? Tom Leighton : Yes, we're strong across the board and we're anticipating that through the rest of this year. And of course at our Investor Day, we talked about the three-to-five-year CAGR goals and as you go back to that material, you'll see it's pretty strong across the board there in terms of our anticipated growth over the longer term. Mike Cikos : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from James Breen with William Blair. James Breen : Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you can give us some color on the US versus the international mix? It seemed like US had a pretty good acceleration on a year-over-year basis this quarter. Is this pandemic driven? Or is it more around the products that's getting sold? And then just secondly, in the margin for Ed, EBITDA margins 45%, you've guided to that to the next quarter. Given the business mix now, is that sort of the starting point in terms of margin structure given CapEx coming down and investments et cetera? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Yeah. Hey, Jim. So on the - I'll take the EBITDA margin question first. Yeah, so 45 is a good spot for this quarter. Obviously, we've got a little bit of expense coming in Q3. So 44, 45-ish, but I think you're thinking about it in the right range. On the US versus international, yeah, US was pretty strong. We've been having pretty decent US growth. If you remember, go back a year or so, a little over a year ago, we were kind of flattish and we started to turn things around there. Lot of it has to do with the strength that we're seeing in media, a lot of the companies are in the US. But in terms of international still having very strong growth internationally, we do come up against some tougher compares. There's pretty strong media business outside the US. So you'll see some tougher compares on the media delivery side, and as I called out from an international perspective, there's - we're still laughing that $15 million of lost revenue associated with the banned apps in India. James Breen : And then, just one other question, are there any sectors that you're seeing that were particularly hit hard by the pandemics that are maybe starting to come back a little bit more as the vaccine has gotten rolled out? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Yeah, I would - yeah, it's a good question, Jim. So I would say the hotel and travel is probably stabilizing a little bit, I wouldn't say we're in the growth phase yet. Maybe starting to see some early signs, it's probably still few quarters before we start to see that business return to a growth engine for us. On retail, it's still a mixed bag. You've got some that are doing well, some that aren't doing well. And just keep in mind that that's 20% of our total business, 40% of your old legacy web business. But it's - I'd say we're optimistic, but still ways to go before we declare a victory there. James Breen : Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. Brandon Nispel : Great, two questions for Ed and one for Tom. Ed, could you just outline how we should be thinking about working capital for the year? And then for the full year '21, what's embedded in your outlook for FX versus your prior expectations? And for Tom, how should we think about the growth in edge applications sequentially as we move throughout the year? I think you mentioned it was about $45 million this quarter. Thanks. Ed McGowan : Hey, Brandon, yeah, I'll take the second one first in terms of FX. So the FX rates we do is at the beginning of the quarter, we sort of take a look at where the FX rates are assuming that's going to stay for the balance of the year. In terms of how it was relative to the beginning of the last quarter, we gave guidance, some currencies are up, some are down that's roughly somewhat in line. I talked about in the prepared remarks that FX sort of came in as expected. We get a little bit of a headwind here quarter-over-quarter, mostly with this in the yen. But I would say just keep an eye on it though. It's just - if you kind of just step back and do the math, we get a little over a $1 billion worth of non-USs denominated revenue. So to the extent that you get a 1%, swing that can swing to $10 million on an annual basis and the major currencies for us a euro, yen, pound and then it kind of drops off from there and the other currencies aren't as impactful. But those are the three to keep an eye on. And then working capital, I'd say, like any other year, you'll see nothing unusual in terms of working capital. This year in Q1, you see us, from a cash flow perspective, we pay out our bonuses early in Q1 and you see cash - working capital, pick up a touch. To call out in terms of collections, we've actually been fantastic. Nothing on the payable side, it's unusual. As we've talked about CapEx is already hit its high point, so nothing really unusual to call on working capital. Tom Leighton : Yeah, and in terms of the edge applications question, you're right about 45 million in Q1. We don't guide separately on an annual basis for that. You just saw over 30% growth in Q1 and at IR Day we did talk about into the three-to-five-year CAGR. Goal there is over 30%. So at a high level, I'd expect to see us continue with very strong growth through the rest of the year in edge applications. Brandon Nispel : That thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Majek with Raymond James. Robert Majek : Great, thanks. Just two questions for me, one, good to see the guide up on the security business to a low 20s rate, but you did just report security growth at 29%. So just how should we read into that? Why should we expect that growth rate to decelerate materially? And then two, just what are you seeing on CDN per unit pricing? Is the level of price decline getting more steeper than usual as larger customers renegotiate their now larger CDN contracts in a COVID boosted traffic environment? Ed McGowan : Yeah, so I'll take both of those. So on the low 20s, the way to think about it is - I just called out when Tim asked the question about license revenue. You got a tougher compare in Q2. With 7 million of license revenue, we don't anticipate repeating in Q2. You also have the Asavie acquisition that will anniversary in Q4. So when you take those two factors into consideration, you'll see the growth rate come down a touch as those sort of work themselves out. On the CDN pricing environment, nothing really to call out there, I've been in this business for a little over 20 years and I've sort of gotten numb to pricing at this point and I don't see anything that is unusual. And also, if there was anything in our top - we in our Earnings Day - Analyst Day we called out our top eight customers, anyone who's over 1% as a metric. And if there's anything in that group of customers worth calling out, I'd certainly do that. And there's really nothing at this point to call out. And as far as renewals are going, we do a pretty good job of anticipating what to expect and it hasn't been negative surprises so far. Thanks Rob. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeff Van Rhee with Craig Hallum. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is Rudy on for Jeff. Thanks for taking my questions. I know in security you've said there's broad based strength in the quarter expect that to continue. Were there any products in there maybe one or two that were just a little bit weaker or saw some challenges or slowdowns, just anything you'd call out? Tom Leighton : I don't think there's anything to call out there, just really was outstanding quarter across the board. We're very pleased with how the security business is doing. Unidentified Analyst : Got it and then the sustainability goals by 2030, is there any boundary you can put around maybe how much expense for those investments there you're factoring in for 21? Or just what the expected impact of margins might be from investments there may be on the longer term. Tom Leighton : Yeah, so, I'll tell the team went through this and there's really not any significant expenses that we anticipate for several years. And even then, the cost that the team has rolled up is not all that significant. We've actually been able to do some pretty creative deals with certain projects on renewable energy that have worked out to be - from a pricing perspective, and no overall net economics have been neutral to even favorable in some cases, so nothing really there to note. Team's doing a fabulous job on it. And if it's - if time goes on, if there's anything we need to call out, we'll certainly let you know. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Great. Thank you. That's it for me. Operator : Our next question comes from Charlie Ehrlich with Baird Charlie Ehrlich : Hey, thanks for taking the question. It's Chuck Ehrlich on for Will Power. I was hoping to dig in a little bit more into the legacy web division. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about maybe the puts and takes in that segment and the declines we're seeing there? And then what it might take to stabilize that segment? Tom Leighton : Yeah, so I would say similar to what we've talked about in the past, right. You've got, obviously strong security growth, you've got from a verticals perspective, you have two verticals, retail and travel, which make up 40% of the legacy web division, vertical division, excuse me. And we're still, like I said, a few questions ago, we're not quite out of the woods there yet. And we're starting to see some stability, but we're not seeing that type of growth yet there. So it's going to take a bit for that to recover. We're doing a nice job of dealing with certain pricing pressure in those verticals with opening up other shares of the wallet, whether it's additional security products or really starting to see a lot of interest in our edge computing and edge applications business as well. So we'll see dollars potentially ship delivery into that category as we go through pricing negotiations, but that's pretty normal. And once we start to see probably in a couple of quarters, hopefully the travel and retail business get back to normal if these vaccines hold and life returns to normal, hopefully start to see that segment of the business growing again. Charlie Ehrlich : Okay. And then on the internet platform customers, we're continuing to see some growth there, which is great. Is there anything specific where that's driving that growth and what we expect for the rest of the year from that cohort? Tom Leighton : Yeah, so it's becoming less impactful. So that's why we're kind of going away from that metric. You didn't hear me talk about in our prepared remarks. I think years ago, people were concerned that that may go to zero. And we talked a couple of years ago about stabilizing that and getting it back to growth. And the team has just done a phenomenal job. So I first tip my hat to the team that's managing those accounts. They've done a nice job of finding areas for us to add value to incredibly innovative technology companies that have their own CDN. And we found a nice spot to pick up this, whether it's adding security or delivering traffic for video and gaming for big scale events, or for live video or even on demand video, we're just finding a nice niche there and that continues to grow. It's up about a $1 million quarter over quarter, very impressive growth rate. I'd say stability is probably a good way to think about that going through the year. There's always upside with these accounts and team's identifying new areas of opportunity all the time. So very pleased with where we are with those customers and expect to see probably similar numbers, what you're seeing now down a little bit, quarter to quarter, depending on certain things that are going on in those accounts. Charlie Ehrlich : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Mike Cikos : Hey, guys, Mike Chico's here again and thanks for getting me on the line. I did just want to follow up. Just looking at my model versus where you guys came in the sales and marketing expense. This quarter was much slower than what we had anticipated, even if I'm removing the accelerators from 4Q and even just looking at Q1 '21 versus Q1 '20, the amount of leverage in the model. Can you talk to how we should expect the sales and marketing to play out over the course of the years? Are there savings being realized from the realigned division? Or the reorganizations you guys had talked to earlier this year? Tom Leighton : Yeah, that's a good point, Mike. So as part of the reorganization, right, some shift between sales and marketing, research and development, a few million bucks, if I remember correctly. And then there was some savings as we moved from the divisional model to one as there was some synergy mostly at the management level. So you'll see some of those costs go away as well. Mike Cikos : Great, thank you for clarifying that. Tom Barth : Okay, well, thank you everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at several investor conferences and roadshows throughout the rest of the second quarter. Details of these can be found in the investor relations section at akamai.com. Thank you for joining us. And all of us here at Akamai wish you continued good health to yourself as well as to your families. Have a nice evening. Tom Leighton : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tom Barth, Investor Relations for Akamai Technologies. Please go ahead. Tom Barth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and Ed McGowan, Akamai\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today\u2019s comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements; the factors include uncertainty stemming from COVID-19 pandemic and any impact from unexpected geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai\u2019s filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company\u2019s view on August 3, 2021. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today\u2019s call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section at akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent financial results in the second quarter, coming in at/or above the high end of our guidance range for both revenue and EPS. Q2 revenue was $853 million, up 7% year-over-year and up 5% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 32%, which reflects our continued focus on operational efficiency, even as we've continued to invest for future growth. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $1.42 per diluted share, up 3% year-over-year. Akamai Security Solutions continued to perform especially well in Q2, generating revenue of $325 million, up 25% year-over-year, and up 22% in constant currency. Cyberattacks generated headlines throughout the first half of the year, and our strong growth reflects the criticality of security to organizations in every sector and geography of the world. Akamai is increasingly recognized as a security leader that offers not just innovative and market leading solutions, but also insights into an enormous amount of Internet data and threat intelligence, a massive distributed platform at the edge of the Internet where most attacks originate. And the technical expertise of one of the industry's largest and most experienced teams of security professionals. The strong growth of our security portfolio was driven by several product lines, including our market leading solutions for web app firewall, bot management, DDoS prevention and Access Control. Our recently released Akamai Page Integrity Manager continued to have rapid adoption in Q2. Page Integrity Manager helps businesses protect their users from having credit card data or other personal information stolen by malware embedded in third-party content. It's also designed to prevent user data from being intentionally or inadvertently sent to third parties such as advertisers or social networks, which can result in a violation of privacy laws and steep fines. As an example, one of our customers is a leading furniture retailer. Page Integrity Manager detected that one of their partners, a major social media platform, was taking their shoppers' e-mail addresses in violation of their data privacy rules. Page Integrity Manager blocks such transfers of personal data and immediately notifies our customers so that appropriate business actions can be taken. In June, we entered beta with a related solution that we call; Audience Hijacking Protection. Audience Hijacking Protection is designed to detect and block malicious or unwanted activity from client side plug-ins, browser extensions and malware. For example, it can quickly identify vulnerable resources, detect suspicious behavior and block unwanted ads, pop-ups, affiliate fraud and other malicious activities that attempt to hijack a retailer's audience. Initial customer interest in this new capability is very strong. Akamai Bot Manager also continued to perform very well in Q2, with revenue growing 40% year-over-year. Bot Manager now has nearly 800 customers with an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $200 million. Our customers use Bot Manager to fort a variety of unwanted activities and attacks such as price scraping, inventory manipulation, credential stuffing and account takeover. Recently, we enhanced our ability to defend against account takeover attempts with the beta launch of Akamai Account Protector. It's designed to proactively identify and block human fraudulent activity using advanced machine learning, behavioral analytics and reputation heuristics. Account Protector intelligently evaluates every login request to determine, if it's coming from a legitimate user or an impersonator. Q2 bookings were also strong for our Prolexic service, which helps organizations defend against the surge of ransom DDOS attacks that began in Q3 of last year. As an example, a leading financial analytics company recently adopted Prolexic to protect them from this growing threat. Prior to that, the company faced operational and technical challenges from needing to manage multiple security technologies from various niche vendors and cloud service providers. Since consolidating with Akamai, they have greatly benefited from reduced complexity, improved security and greater consistency for compliance and risk management across their many business units. As you all likely know, there have been widespread ransomware, data theft and other malware attacks against major enterprises this year. Included were well-publicized attacks on critical infrastructure at a major pipeline company, the world's largest meat packer and a freight operator that serves as the lifeline for 2 popular island destinations in New England. The need to stop these kinds of attacks is driving organizations to adopt new Zero Trust and Secure Access Service Edge, or SASE Solutions, such as those offered by Akamai. For example, when the exchange server attack hit thousands of organizations in March, Akamai's e-mail wasn't compromised, because our IT department uses Akamai's Enterprise Application Access solution, which prevented unauthorized access to our exchange server. Our Access Control suite of products continue to be Akamai's fastest-growing security segment in Q2, with revenue up 161% year-over-year, including the acquisition of Asavie, and up 57% on an organic basis. As one example of a new customer, we closed a large security contract in Q2 with a company that helps maritime operators manage risk. This company has thousands of employees and hundreds of offices throughout the world. They adopted our Enterprise Application Access and Kona Site Defender solutions to secure the access to their applications and to protect their internal systems from malware and other threats. I'll now turn to our CDN portfolio, which generated revenue of $528 million in Q2, down 1% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency. This result was in line with our expectations and reflects the challenging comparison against last year's pandemic-related jump in traffic and the loss of revenue from Chinese applications that were banned from India in July of 2020. Traffic on our platform remained strong in Q2, with peaks exceeding 130 terabits per second every day throughout the quarter. This enormous amount of traffic provides strong evidence of how much customers were live on our platform's unparalleled scale and reach, which is enabled by more than 4,200 points of presence at the edge, in 135 countries around the world. Our tremendous global presence is especially important to the world's major broadcasters, who continue to look to Akamai to deliver the world's most significant events. For example, during the recent European football tournament, the peak traffic that we delivered globally for more than 30 broadcasters was 35 terabits per second, nearly 5 times the peak observed in 2016. Our fast-growing Edge Applications segment delivered $47 million in Q2, up 35% year-over-year and up 32% in constant currency. This rapid growth rate reflects the shift of compute workloads from core data centers, on-prem or in the cloud to our edge platform for offload, improved performance, security and global scale. For example, each time a user accesses one of our retailer customer sites, the retailer's geo location code is executed on an Akamai edge server to identify the user's location and then deliver content tailored for that location. Overall, we're now supporting an average of 5 billion such edge computing instantiations per day on our platform. In summary, I'm pleased to report that we've executed according to the plan we outlined for investors during our February Analyst Day. In particular, we continued to achieve strong demand from customers for our security and edge computing solutions, diversification of our business across products, geographies and sales channels, and strong financial performance on both the top and bottom lines. Before turning the call over to Ed, I'd like to formally welcome Sharon Bowen to our Board of Directors. Sharon's had extensive experience in financial and securities transactions for large global companies and we're very much looking forward to benefiting from her engagement and counsel. In addition, as many of you know, our Board is now chaired by Dan Hesse, who succeeded Fred Salerno in June. Dan has held senior management positions in the telco industry for many years, including as CEO of Sprint. He's also recognized as a leader in ESG and is providing valuable advice and oversight to our senior management team. Of course, we all deeply appreciate Fred's many years of outstanding leadership and service to Akamai, and we wish him the very best in his future endeavors. I'll now turn the call over to Ed to provide further details on our Q2 results and our outlook for next quarter and the full year. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. As Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter. Q2 revenue was $853 million, at the high end of our guidance range and up 7% year-over-year or 5% in constant currency. Revenue growth was led by broad-based strength across our Security business globally. Revenue from our Security Technology Group was $325 million, up 25% year-over-year or 22% in constant currency. Security now accounts for 38% of our total revenue. We saw strong performance across our major security products, including Bot Manager, Prolexic, and our Access Control product suite. Revenue from our Edge Technology Group was $528 million, down 1% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. These results were in line with our internal expectations, which factored in challenging comparisons from our outstanding CDN results in Q2 a year ago. The tough year-over-year compares within our Edge delivery business offset the continued strong growth in our edge applications business. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $2 million on a sequential basis and a positive $19 million on a year-over-year basis, largely in line with our expectations. International revenue was $403 million, up 15% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets represented 47% of total revenue in Q2, up three points from Q2 2020 and up two points from Q1 levels. As a reminder, our Q2 results last year included approximately $15 million of revenue from China-based apps that were banned in India from Q3 2020 onwards. Adjusting for this impact, international growth would have been approximately 20% year-over-year and 14% in constant currency. Finally, revenue from our US market was $450 million, up 1% year-over-year. Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 62%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $259 million, slightly below our guidance range due to lower-than-expected hiring during the quarter. Now, moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $386 million. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45%, in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income was $270 million, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, slightly favorable to our guidance due to lower operating expenses I just mentioned. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $138 million, consistent with our guidance range. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $156 million or $0.94 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $233 million or $1.42 of earnings per diluted share, up 3% year-over-year, down 1% in constant currency and $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $39 million, based on a Q2 effective tax rate of approximately 14.5%. Now I will discuss some balance sheet items. As of June 30th, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.6 billion. After accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our two convertible notes, net cash was approximately $281 million as of June 30th. Now I will review our use of capital. During the second quarter, we spent approximately $96 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 900,000 shares. We ended Q2 with approximately $417 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Our plan remains to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution, resulting from equity compensation over time. Moving on to Q3 guidance. We are projecting Q3 revenue in the range of $845 million to $860 million or up 7% to 9% as reported or 6% to 8% in constant currency over Q3 2020. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $3 million impact on Q3 revenue compared to Q2 levels and a positive $5 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $257 million to $262 million, and we anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins of approximately 45%. Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $120 million to $121 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31% for Q3. Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $135 million to $140 million excluding equity compensation in the third quarter. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.37 to $1.41. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $38 million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 14.5%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we are raising our guidance for both revenue and EPS. We now expect revenue of $3.42 billion to $3.45 billion, which is up 7% to 8% year-over-year as reported, or up 6% to 7% in constant currency. We now expect Security revenue growth to be in the low to mid-20% range for the full year 2021. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.54 to $5.65. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 14.5% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. Finally, full year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 16% of revenue, consistent with our prior guidance. We are very pleased with our excellent financial results in the first half, and we look forward to delivering a strong second half. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Breen from William Blair. Your line is now open. James Breen : Thanks for taking the question. Can you talk about some of the seasonality around the business, second, third quarter? Obviously, the Olympics is happening right now and sort of how you see the impact in the business, given how the traffic patterns have been so far. And then it seems like operating income 31% is moving up a little bit. Can you just talk about some of the dynamics and where you see that going as security maybe becomes a bigger part of the business? Ed McGowan : Jim, thanks for the question. This is Ed. In terms of seasonality, Q3, typically, we tend to see a little bit of slowdown in traffic over the summer months, we were calling for sort of a flattish quarter to Q2 here with the guide. We'll see a little bit of slowdown in August. I would expect -- I've got the Olympics in there. Not expecting a ton from the Olympics this year, it's a couple of million bucks that we have in the quarter. We did see in terms of seasonality in Q2, we did see a bit of a lighter gaming quarter in Q2. We would expect to see that probably pick up a bit here in the back half of the year. And then obviously, in Q4, that's our most challenging quarter to call, which you've got really 2 seasons there. You've got the commerce season and then the -- we typically see a large media season as well. So we're expecting that in Q4. And we'll update you as we go and we'll get more information as the year goes on. And for the next call, we'll update you on what we're seeing for the Q4 seasonality. The margin question, yes, we had a better quarter from an operating margin perspective. Hiring was a little bit lighter than normal. Just a couple of things to keep in mind on the margin front. July is when we have our annual merit increase or our salary increases, so that comes into effect beginning in Q3. Then also, we do expect that we'll see some travel expenses and some costs related to offices reopening in the back half of the year as well. Tom and I have talked about, we plan on operating the business in the 30% range. This year, we'll do a little bit better, but we do want to continue to invest for the opportunities we see in front of us in Security. James Breen : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. I'm curious to understand, how you're thinking about the investment on the go-to-market, specifically sales headcount in the security side of the business, given the strength that you're seeing? Tom Leighton : We do have a specialist team for our newest security products. And that's very helpful until the field can get up to speed. But our entire go-to-market operation is now well versed in selling security products. So they really only need the assist for the newly released products. And so we don't have a bifurcated sales force now. Sterling Auty : Understood. And then just one follow-up in terms of the security competitive landscape, especially on the newer solutions like Page Integrity Manager. Who is the point person you're selling into? And are these uncontested, or what other solutions do they tend to consider when they're looking at it? Tom Leighton : Yes. For our new solutions, you might see a start-up out there with something similar. Our normal competition doesn't have these capabilities. And it's a big advantage to be able to offer these capabilities with the existing platform because once you're on Akamai, for example, you're using our Web App Firewall, which is a market-leading solution, it's very easy to add Page Integrity Manager on top. We just take care of that. The customer says they want it and we turn it on. And the request \u2013 the data flow is not changed. The same will be true with Audience Hijacking Protection, same thing, built right on top of the Web App Firewall, and our other solutions. So it really is very convenient for customers to buy from us. And there really isn't something that's comparable in the marketplace. And these are adding great value. In terms of the buyer, Audience Hijacking Protection, that could really go the range. Probably it ends up more towards the marketing side of the house because literally, their audience is being hijack today. Any retailer has a problem where \u2013 because of malware that's on the user's browser or plug-ins or extensions they have, that malware and those plug-ins are looking for somebody about to do a transaction. And what they'll do is put some pop-up over at saying, wait a minute, go here instead. Or even worse, it will be some fraud, where they'll change the refer header and claim credit for this buyer and our customer now has to pay more. So if for products like that, it could be anywhere from the security side all the way through the website and through the marketing side of the house because it provides so much value, it reduces cost, increases revenue and provides greater security. Really, it's very nice to see that because it's a very good blend between our delivery and performance solutions and our security solutions all wrapped up in one package. Sterling Auty : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Tyler from Baird. Your line is now open. Charlie Erlikh : This is Charlie Erlikh on for Will. Thanks for taking my question. I had a sort of a sort of a two-part question on contract renegotiations. I guess, first, are there any big contracts coming up that we should be aware of, or is it pretty spread out over the back half of the year and into next year? And then part two, for the contract renegotiations that you've already had, kind of curious what you're hearing in terms of sort of the health of the customers? And are they still asking for price concessions, or are we closer to back to pre-pandemic levels in that respect? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Yes. So on the -- in terms of the big contracts up for renewal, we had a few that we did this quarter. And then, I'd say, the rest are sort of spread out fairly evenly. If there's ever anything that is major, I tend to try to call that out. But as we disclosed in our IR day, we don't have significant customer concentration risk. But sometimes you can get a few of them all together that can make a little bit of noise in the quarter, but they're pretty much spread out. And in terms of the health of the customers, it really varies by vertical. We do see, I would say, pretty standard pricing discussions. This industry traditionally has had deflationary pricing when it comes to -- especially volumes, but it's being driven by volume. And I don't see any major change there. Really nothing to call out. I think it's still too early to call an end to the pandemic, obviously. So we've got some significant business with commerce and retailers, and that's still kind of playing itself out at this point. We've seen some pickup in volume, but we're not out of the woods yet there. But in terms of overall pricing, really nothing to call out in terms of any major changes. Charlie Erlikh : Great. Thanks, Ed. And just if I can just squeeze in another one. You used to give this helpful metric on the percentage of customers that are taking one security product and the percentage that are taking multiple security products. Is that something that you could provide us now or you're not giving that metric anymore? Ed McGowan : Yeah, sure. I can give you that number. So right now, we've got about 55% of our customers that are buying one security product and about 32% that are buying more than one. But just keep in mind that our customer base has grown over the last year, it's up probably by 5% or 6% over the last year. So we're doing a pretty good job of getting penetration into the base. But the base is also growing. If I go back a year ago, Q2 of 2020, that number for folks that have acquired a security product was around 59%. So we're seeing really healthy growth in terms of the overall number of customers, both from penetration of the base, but also just the size of the customer base is growing as well. Charlie Erlikh : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss for Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Mike Wilson : Hi. It's Mike Wilson on for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking our question. I'd like to dig a little bit deeper into the Edge Applications. What type of use cases you're seeing? And what other verticals you're kind of seeing traction in besides retail? You gave a nice example in your prepared remarks, but anything additional would be helpful. Tom Leighton : Sure. It really is useful, I think, across all verticals. Gaming is another example of the big -- our big gaming customers had interest there. They want to get local decisions made in terms of who's playing who, what master server maybe they go back to for the gaming instructions. Another great example is the COVID vaccine registration sites. In this case, it was a third-party company unrelated to us, built a queuing application on top of our EdgeWorkers solution that is used today by, I think, dozens now, governments and pharmaceutical companies to assist in getting vaccine registrations. And of course, in the early days in the U.S. and still in many countries, there's a lot more people that want to get a vaccine than you have capacity for and so you want to be fair. So if somebody comes into the website, they get into the queue, and they know how long the queue is and that whole process is managed. And again, that's an ideal application to run with our edge computing service. And also handles all the excess load and the flash crowd around the site when you announced, okay, we got a lot of vaccines available in a certain period of time. A lot of people come at once. So maybe they know when that's going to happen, and so we provide the overflow capacity for that. But really, anything you could imagine that involves locality, the need to rapidly scale would be a suitable use for our EdgeWorkers solutions. IoT applications, I think, in the future is a big driver of demand there. And I think that gets enabled by 5G as that gets deployed, and you get a lot more devices connected. But there, you've got a lot of devices with a lot of communication back and forth, very chatty protocols, data being sent in and you need to aggregate that and make decisions quickly locally on the fly, edge computing, edge applications is a good example for that. Tailoring the content based on the device type and the local connectivity is another example. We do that with our image and video manager applications, where if you're on a, say, a cellular device, you don't have a big screen and maybe you don't have great connectivity, we will automatically, at the edge with the edge computing, put in a smaller \u2013 a lower resolution version of the image. And on your device, it will look the same. So there's no real reduction in quality, but the less traffic needed to convey the image means you get better performance for the end user. So there's just all sorts of applications that people are using. And now we're doing those, kinds of, things five billion times a day on our edge platform using Edge Java. Mike Wilson : That's really great color. And then pivoting to the CDN solutions within the Edge Technology Group, anything to call out in terms of pricing? And then how should we think about revenue from the Internet platform customers and the second half of 2021? Ed McGowan : Yes. I'll take that one, Tom. So the -- in terms of pricing, as I just mentioned, really nothing to call out on the pricing side. As far as Internet platform customers go, the team's doing a great job executing there, we continue to grow that group of customer\u2019s obviously very highly innovative customer base, a lot of them have their own CDN, but we're doing a good job of growing that business and very happy with the performance there. I expect that revenue stream to continue to run along about the same pace that it's going now for the rest of the year, maybe see a little bit of upside in this fourth quarter. Mike Wilson : All right. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. James Fish : Hey guys, thanks for the questions. First, on the external and internal-based cloud access solutions, what one is really leading the charge at this point? And what has been the pushback from customers that are evaluating other solutions that may pick a competitor? And do you plan on building or acquiring into the rest of that SASE stack like in DLP or CASB? Tom Leighton : So yes, we're interested in the entire SASE stack. I would say we're really focused though on stopping malware, stopping these ransom DDoS, ransomware attacks, stopping data exfiltration. And that puts us in the direction of a focus on access to make sure that we do the access control of the application layer, not as it's traditionally done at the network layer, and that makes a huge difference in terms of the malware getting inside in the first place. Also, we have Secure Web Gateway capabilities, probably market-leading DNS capabilities, which makes a big difference in terms of data exfiltration. And we do have some DLP capabilities today with our newest version of Enterprise Threat Protector. CASB, less capabilities there today, potentially of interest, but not the primary mission in terms of stopping the data exfiltration, the ransomware attacks, the malware attacks on enterprises. And of course, ransom DDoS, which our Prolexic solution helps a lot with -- along with Kona. So good traction there. As you see the growth on the access side of the house now, well over 50% organically. And of course, if you account the Asavie acquisition, over 160% year-over-year. We plan to continue investing there organically, also through potentially M&A, we're always looking there. And I think that has a lot of future potential for us. James Fish : That's helpful, Tom. And I guess I'll be the one to take the bait. Obviously, 2 outages during the last couple of months here. Can you just walk us through, maybe add what the financial impact could be in terms of any SLA refunds or what you heard back in terms of feedback from customers regarding the DNS and the DDoS issues? Thanks? Tom Leighton : Yes. In terms of financial impact, de minimis. We lost, at the peak, about 2% of our traffic for up to 1 hour. So not any financial impact per se. That said, we care a lot about reliability at Akamai. It is core to everything we want to do. And we've put a ton of effort into making our solutions be reliable over the last 10-plus years. In fact, you have to go back to 2004 to find anything comparable in terms of what's happened on our platform. In 2004, we actually took the entire platform down for about an hour, which was disastrous. That didn't happen in this case, but we did hurt hundreds of our customers, and we deeply regret that. We impacted them and their users, and that's unacceptable. In both cases, there was an update that caused a problem. And we have invested a lot in infrastructure to make sure that updates are done safely. In this case, the updates were totally different and totally different systems at Akamai. But as a result of this, we are taking a fresh look at how we release updates to make sure that something like this won't happen again. And meanwhile, we've locked down all update channels as we do a thorough investigation of each one. People don't often realize it, but we are constantly doing updates. We have a platform with dozens of services. We have many, many thousands of customers. Any given customers maybe wanted to make an update to their site on an hourly basis or more. And so it's just thousands and thousands a day of updates that are taking place in the platform. And because of the really very intense work that we've done over the last decade, we have had an excellent track record of keeping any problem with an update from spreading. Humans making updates will make mistakes. And our goal is to prevent -- to catch them early and prevent them from spreading. And in this case, there were 2 different channels where that didn't happen the way we want it to. And so we are putting in a lot of effort to look at every possible channel and make sure it is working the way we want to. And not only do we not want to have any more incidents this year, we don't want to be having this happen in the next 10 years. And so there's a lot of effort going into making sure that's the case. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Tim Horan : Thanks. Tom, just maybe two really higher level questions. Can you just talk about how important edge compute do you think is going to be in the cloud in terms of -- for specific applications? What percentage will have some edge component to it? And how do you think your infrastructure holds up compares to competitors for providing that edge? And then on the security front, another just really high-level question. Do customers understand how much better cloud-based security is than on-prem? And where are we with that process? Tom Leighton : Yes, good questions. I think edge computing is really important in the future. And when I say edge, I really mean edge, and that's a big difference with the competition, none of whom really have an edge platform. Of course, for the last couple of years, everybody says they have edge everything. It's just -- it's not true. We're in over 4,000 locations, in about 1,000 cities and 135 countries, and nobody is anywhere, anywhere close to that. And we offer native Javascript support now, which a lot of the folks that talk about edge computing don't. And we spin up our apps in a few milliseconds, and that's a factor of 1,000 better than some of the folks that talk a lot about edge computing out there. So, I think we stack up very well against the competition there. And I think you see that reflected in our very strong growth. That segment now well over 30% growth year-over-year. We think we can maintain that. And on a reasonable size number, last year, $150 million, we're now almost up to a $200 million annual revenue run rate for our edge applications business. So, I think very strong future potential. And as you grow in your 30% a year on a number that's about $200 million now, after a few years, that starts really being meaningful. And I think that drives accelerated growth for the CDN business. And remind me again of the security question you had. Tim Horan : Well, it seems like security is rapidly moving to the cloud. I guess the customers understand how much better that is, where do you think we are in the process? Tom Leighton : Yes, that's a good question. It's interesting because we started with application firewall. And if you go back five or six years, pretty much everybody bought a device and managed it in their data set. And today, there's still a few enterprises that do that. But pretty much all the major B2C companies on large -- majority of them are now using Akamai for that as a cloud service. And we're the market leader by far in application firewall. You look at DDoS. And again, go back five-plus years, that was managed either in the data center or with a single carrier. And that just doesn't work anymore. You can't handle the volume. And so now Akamai is the market leader by far with a cloud service there. I think you will see the same thing happen with enterprise security. Today, it is done, you get your VPN and you get your boxes and you manage them in your data center. That is not a good way to do it. That's why you have all these breaches. When you're providing network layer access, it's a disaster. You look at the big pipeline company that had a problem. It's just one of many thousands of enterprises. Credentials to the BPM are stolen, put on the dark web, somebody gets them. And that just gives them access to the entire network. And you can't do it that way. And that's why our solutions are so important with application layer access. Now sure you can steal somebody's credentials, but of course, you want multifactor authentication. And then you only get access to the app. And if you're using Akamai, you don't even get access to the app directly. You got to come through us, and we'll make sure there's no malware going to that app or you're not exploiting vulnerabilities, and then you don't have those kind of situations. So I think if you look at the exchange server situation, which I talked about a few minutes ago. Again, by having Akamai in front with our Enterprise Application Access, our e-mail wasn't stolen, even though we had the vulnerable software like everybody else did. So it will take some time. We're at the beginnings of, I'd say, Zero Trust approach and moving to the cloud, in particular to the edge \u2013 My Edge platform for enterprise security, but I do think there's a tremendous future there because we're in a position to really stop those breaches. Tim Horan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen. Your line is now open. Colby Synesael : Thank you. Two modeling questions, if I might. The first one, just looking at the guide increase for 2021. Just curious if you're going to agree with how I'm thinking about it, which is it seems like it reflects a 2Q upside, maybe a little bit of upside in terms of your expectations for 3Q, but really no change as it relates to your assumptions for 4Q. And it sounds like that's more a function of just lack of visibility opposed to some type of step-down or negative impact, if you will, that you're now anticipating? Just curious, if I'm thinking about that correctly. And then secondly, it sounds like in response to one of questions, regarding M&A it may have been suggesting that you guys obviously continue to look and may even be close to something. Are you guys still holding a line where M&A is expected to be accretive within some short period of time, or are valuations getting to a point now, where if you were, in fact, to do something of materiality, it could actually be relatively meaningfully dilutive just given what you'd have today? Thank you. Ed McGowan : All right. So I'll take the first question, Colby. So in terms of Q4, I think you're thinking about it correctly, we always talk on Q4 being the hardest quarter to call. And then obviously, there's been a bit of a flare-up here with the Delta virus. So we're going with what we see now, as I said earlier in the call, we'll update you as we get more visibility. There's two seasons to call. There's the commerce season, and commerce is a very important vertical for us. And then also, as we've seen in the last several years, there tends to be a big jump step-up in media. So we'll get some more information as we go. But I think you're thinking about it correctly. Tom Leighton : Yes. And in terms of the M&A question, we're always looking for companies that have novel capabilities that we can use to build products for our customers that are synergistic with our platform and our solutions we have today. And you're right, there are areas, particularly in security and also edge computing that have very high valuations to that. And that makes it harder to do acquisitions that make sense because we're not going to do something that's crazy. Now when you're looking at acquisition, we look at it over the long-term and so that we want it to be accretive, certainly over the long-term. In addition to the purchase price, we also worry about the hit margins, especially when you do an acquisition, often as you know, the first year, you have revenue recognition issues where you don't get to recognize all the revenue right away. And so in the first year, you can take a hit to your margins. And if we find the right acquisition that is really helpful to us in growth over the long-term and it will be accretive to margins over the long-term, there may be a situation where we would take a short-term hit to margins, and then we would improve them from there. Colby Synesael : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open. Brandon Nispel : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Ed, I'm curious about, you mentioned headcount growth slowed and actually was down sequentially. Can you update us on your hiring plans for the rest of the year? And do you believe the company needs another phase of investment in headcount in order to sustain the current growth trajectory? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Yeah, sure. So I talked about headcount being a little bit behind hiring. Obviously, last year, we had record low attrition. And we're still not back to the attrition levels that we saw pre-pandemic. But we're just a little bit behind on our hiring. I expect that will catch up. We're scaling the company very well. As you can see, our margins have improved quite a bit. But we still want to make investments in security. You've seen some of our newer products have grown to a pretty material size. We've got some very fast and exciting growing businesses with our edge computing business along with very deep product bench for security. So we're going to continue to invest there. There will be some investments in go-to-market. And then, obviously, as we continue to grow, there'll be some scaling heads that we have to add. But nothing in terms of like a major investment cycle or anything like that that we anticipate coming. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos from Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Mike Cikos : Hi team. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to focus on the security and the improved outlook you guys provided today. It seems like the security, in general is facing broad-based demand, but are there any solutions specifically that are driving this improved outlook? And then I guess a follow-on, with the current threat environment, the headlines we're seeing, is this driving a material change in customer interest? Are you seeing any noticeable impact on sales cycles or budget flowing into this space as a result of that? Tom Leighton : The good news is we're seeing strong demand across all of our major security product lines. And also the new security products are obviously not contributing a lot of revenue yet, but we're seeing strong interest in those as well. So it's just a -- it's a good picture across the board. The threat environment certainly increases the awareness and need for our solutions. In terms of sales cycle, obviously, if a customer is under attack, the sales cycle can be very short. In many cases, we'll integrate the customer within a matter of hours or days and often a follow-up with all the details of the contract later, and we've seen a lot of that. With these ransom DDoS attacks, dozens and dozens of major enterprises in that situation that very quickly become happy Akamai customers. So it's a good environment, I would say, in terms of security sales for all of our security products right now. Mike Cikos : Thanks for that. And if I'm just thinking about the traffic trends, trying to parse out between the typical seasonality where there's a slower leg, if you will, in the summer months. And I'm matching that up against what we have with COVID and this Delta variant we're seeing, trying to -- can you guys better comment on that? I'm just trying to put those two pieces together to see what's baked into the guidance as we stand today, or how you see that traffic playing out over the last month, now that we're in Q3? Thank you. Ed McGowan : Yeah, good question. So what we've assumed here is that there really isn't going to be a major step-up in demand like we saw last year. So not anticipating major lockdowns or anything like that. So then, obviously, if something like that were to happen, it could increase our traffic in the quarter. We do see typical seasonality in the summer months, typically August in, hopefully Europe, in particular, tends to be lighter than expected. So we're anticipating that. It's offset a little bit by the Olympics. Again, I told you not a ton there, a few million bucks for the Olympics. But security growth is also not necessarily impacted by traffic. So we could see if we do see lockdowns, you could see traffic accelerate a bit. And we're not really anticipating that, it's not in our guide at this point. We are expecting to see a strong seasonal Q4. And like I said a couple of times now, we'll update when we talk to you again, when we get more visibility. But traffic has got back to, what I would call, more normal growth rates. Obviously, we went through a year-and-a-half of accelerated traffic growth with the launch of some major OTT platforms along with the pandemic. So we\u2019re modeling what I would consider to be sort of a more normal CDN outlook. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Rose from Battle Road Research. Your line is now open. Ben Rose : Yes. Good afternoon. A question for Tom and then a question for Ed. For Tom, you mentioned at the outset, the Akamai Account Protector that you're working on in beta. I was curious to know if you could provide a little bit more information on the kind of benefits to customers that would come from this product that may not be available in Akamai's security portfolio currently. Tom Leighton : Sure. Account Protector is sort of the next step beyond Bot Manager. Bot Manager detects whether it's a human being that's trying to, for example, to log into an account. And as you probably know, there's a ton of account stuffing going on. We see every day now about 1 billion illegitimate attempts to log into an account of some kind, a bank account, gaming account, a commerce account. And the vast, vast majority of that is bot traffic. Credentials have been stolen somewhere and a Bot network is used to check out those credentials against a lot of websites to see if you get a hit. Now the adversaries have evolved, the attackers have evolved. And now I will use humans to attempt to log in and steal accounts. Now you can't do that at the same scale as you can with a bot army. But you use things that you think may well get in and now the human will do it. And so we need to decide, well, okay, it's human, but is it the right human? And that's what Account Protector is all about. And it will use information about the human that's been using that account before with a variety of inputs and trust scores and then using machine learning to the side on the fly based on everything we can see here, is this the right human for this account? And we give a score that is used to decide, are we going to provide access directly? Do you go to some other security mechanism, like you get asked questions or a capture test of some kind, or do you just block? And that's what Account Protector does. So it is one-step deeper analysis that will now deal with human-based fraud and then specifically around the log-in function. Now of course, Bot Manager covers a lot of other things, too, like price scraping, inventory stealing, inventory \u2013 reserving all the seats in a hotel or an airline by a competitor, that kind of thing. So, this is really focused on fraud and log-in that's being done by humans. Tom Barth : Ben, you had a question for Ed, maybe you could restate it. Tom Leighton : I don't think it was stated. Tom Barth : Ben, what was your question for Ed? Thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at several investor conferences and road shows throughout the rest of the third quarter. Details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Thank you for joining us, and all of us here at Akamai wish have a wonderful evening. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require assistance during the conference, [ Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barton, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Tom Barth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining Akamai's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer, and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance.  These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and then Involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. These factors include uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from unexpected geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SCC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call will represent the Company's view on November second, 2021, Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom. And thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent financial results in the third quarter, coming in at or above the high end of our guidance ranges for revenue, operating margin, and earnings per share. Q3 revenue was $860 million, up 9% year-over-year, and up 8% in constant-currency. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 32%, which reflects our continued focus on operational efficiency even as we've continued to invest for future growth. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was a $1.45 per diluted share, up 11% year-over-year.  Akamai's strong performance in Q3 was largely driven by our security business, which is now one of our leading cloud security businesses in the world, with an annualized revenue run rate of more than $1.3 billion, up 26% year-over-year, and up 25% in constant currency. Over the last several years, we've grown our security portfolio from point solutions into a comprehensive platform that provides defense in depth to address our customers biggest threats. The unique breadth of our defenses is important to our customers who want more security capabilities from fewer vendors. Our security solutions are highly differentiated and recognized as best-in-class by our customers, who see us as a leading provider of services to protect our most critical assets, including enterprise websites, applications, data, and access. We routinely earned top rankings in multiple categories for major industry analysts. For example, Akamai disrupted the web apps security market when we launched Kona Site Defender in 2012. Since then we've continued to extend our leadership position and the web app firewall sector with Gartner recently naming Akamai as a market leader for the 5th year in a row.  Akamai has been the market leader in DDoS protection since we acquired Prolexic in 2014, Forester recently said, ''Large enterprise clients that want an experienced, trusted vendor to make their DDoS problem go away, should look to Akamai. '' As new threat vectors have emerged, we've extended our platform to defend against them. For example, we created the first comprehensive bot management solution to protect our customers from sophisticated bot operators would try to steal content, disrupt operations are penetrate user accounts. According to Forester, Akamai is best for companies wanting to [Indiscernible] bots off the edge. Bloomberg Business Week even quoted a hacker calling Akamai's bot defense the hardest to crack. More recently, we released Akamai page integrity manager to identify malicious code of third-party scripts and websites that's designed to steal end-user data. Page integrity manager helps to address a major threat that's been costing businesses hundreds of millions of dollars and fines, as well as serious reputation damage. We plan to extend our web app protections further in the coming months with the release of Account Protector and Audience Hijacking Prevention. Account Protector is designed to reduce fraud by making sure that the entity logging into an account is the crew owner of that account.  Audience Hijacking Prevention can help businesses protects sales by fording malware that diverts a customer just before the completion of a transaction. Since founding, Akamai over 20 years ago, our vision has always been to help our customers solve their toughest Internet challenges, and today that includes stopping ransomware. Ransomware is a huge problem for enterprises around the world, with a new attack striking every 11 seconds. The damage resulting from ransomware is expected to amount over $20 billion this year alone. Garda core (ph.) is critical to stopping the spread of ransomware, and that's a key reason why we acquired the Company.  Akamai is already selling solutions such as Enterprise Application Access that help prevent attackers from gaining access to enterprise infrastructure and applications. But to be secure in today's world, you also need a second layer of defense to lock the spread of malware that has gained a foothold in the enterprise. And that's where Garda core comes in. Garda core helps detect when a breach occurred by identifying anomalous data flows within enterprise networks. Garda core also helps prevent the malware from spreading through a capability known as micro-segmentation.  Garda core's, micro-segmentation solution limits access within the enterprise to only those applications that are authorized to communicate with one another. Denying communication as the default greatly limits the spread of malware and protects the flow of enterprise data across the network. And that's the key to stopping ransomware. We believe Guard core 's best-in-class micro-segmentation solution is the perfect addition to our Zero Trust portfolio, enabling Akamai to offer customers a comprehensive solution to stop the damage being caused by ransomware and malware.  During the call we held on September 29, we spoke about the parallels between our acquisition of Guard core with our acquisition of Prolexic in 2014. Just as the acquisition of Prolexic propelled us to a leadership position in helping to stop DDoS attacks. We believe that the acquisition of Guard core will establish Akamai as a leader in helping to stop the damage caused by ransomware, as well as other forms of malware. Customers see, Akamai as a strategic partner in security, not only because of the strength and breadth of our solutions, but also because of the depth of our security expertise in threat intelligence and the scale of our platform. The same platform that underpins our world-leading CDN. Akamai CDN handles over 5 trillion requests every day. In addition, we resolve more than 3 trillion DNS queries each day. This gives us unmatched real-time insight into the world's Internet traffic, which we analyzed to provide best-in-class threat intelligence, protection, and support. We also have one of the industry's largest and most experienced teams of security professionals with thousands of engineers and consultants working on security for our customers. Our security solutions are tightly integrated into the world's largest and most distributed Edge platform. And that provides unmatched global scale to defend customers against not only the largest DDoS attacks, but also against the best spot armies that are waging attacks from the edge. The integration of our security solutions with our CDN solutions also provides benefits to our customers in terms of improved performance and ease of use. With Akamai, security and performance go hand in hand. You can buy them together as a single for tech and perform package, which makes purchasing and integration easy for the customer. And when you buy security from Akamai, your performance is automatically improved. That's because we apply the security layer as we're delivering the content from the world's true Edge platform. This means that the processing needed for security stays close to the end-user, which makes for much better performance. Akamai's unique combination of security and delivery provides a powerful offering in the market, which is one reason by we are the market leaders in both security CDN. Our CDN business also generates substantial cash that we can use to invest in future growth. As we've recently done with the Guard core acquisition. For example, our CDN business generated revenue of $526 million in Q3, and contributed substantially to our overall free cash flow of $273 million. Enough to cover almost half of what we spent to acquire Guard core. We believe that having the world's largest and most distributed Edge network also provides a great foundation for the growth of our Edge applications business. As 5G rolls out, as IOT applications proliferate, and as more data is created and processed at the edge. A kamai's Edge compute platform is very well-suited to support the high throughput and low latency applications that are not well served by traditional cloud providers today. From delivery and performance to compute and security, the world's leading brands want our help. That's because the internet is getting more complicated with more traffic, higher user expectations, and more cyber threats every day.  And the world's leading enterprises know that, Akamai can help keep their digital experiences close to their end-users and the threats further away. They know that what we do makes life better for billions of people, billions of times a day, and that nobody powers and protects life online like Akamai. I will now turn the call over to Ed to provide further details on our Q3 results and our outlook for the rest of the year. Ed. Ed Mc Gowan : Thank you, Tom. As Tom just outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter. Q3 revenue was $860 million, up 9% year-over-year, or 8% in constant currency. Revenue was again driven by very strong results in our security business. Revenue from our security technology group was $335 million, up 26% year-over-year, or 25% in constant currency. Security now accounts for 39% of our total revenue. Revenue from our Edge technology group was $526 million flat year-over-year and down 1% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations heading negative impact on revenue of $5 million on a sequential basis in positive $4 million on a year-over-year basis. International revenue was $412 million up 16% year-over-year, or 15% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets represented 48% of total revenue in Q3, up 3 points from Q3, 2020, and up 1 point from Q2 levels. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $449 million up 3% year-over-year. Moving now to costs, cash gross margin was 76% in line with our expectations.  GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 63% non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $261 Million. Now moving on to profitability, adjusted EBITDA was $396 million. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46%, non-GAAP operating income was $277 million and Non-GAAP operating margin was 32%. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $129 million. This was below our guidance range, primarily due to continued progress on network capex efficiency projects.  GAAP Net Income for the third quarter was $179 million or $1.08 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $239 million or $1.45 of earnings per diluted share, up 11% year-over-year, up 10% in constant currency, and $0.04 above the high-end of our guidance range. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $39 million based on a Q3 effective tax rate of approximately 14%. Moving now to cash in our use of capital. As of September 30th, our cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.8 billion after accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our 2 convertible notes. Net cash was approximately $452 million as of September 30th. During the third quarter, we spent approximately $97 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 800 thousand shares. We ended Q3 with approximately $321 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization, which runs through the end of this year. As noted in today's press release, our Board authorized a new buyback program of up to $1.8 billion beginning January 1st, 2022, and running through the end of 2024. As we've previously discussed, our primary intention is to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time. However, our repurchase authorizations also allow us to opportunistically deploy capital if or when we believe there is a valuation disconnect in the market based on business or market conditions.  Combining the two authorizations, we currently have more than $2 billion available for share repurchases through the end of 2024. We believe our strong Balance Sheet and significant free cash flow generation, which totaled $273 million or 32% of total revenue in Q3 also provides us with significant financial flexibility to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy. As such, we plan to continue to invest organically in R&D and product development, expand our capabilities through M&A as you saw with our most recent acquisition of Guard core and return capital to shareholders via share repurchases. Moving onto Q4 guidance, there are two factors to consider as you update your models for the Fourth Quarter. First, we closed the acquisition Guard core on October 20th. Our guidance assumes Guard core will contribute approximately $6 to $7 million of revenue in Q4. It also assumes that Quadcore will be approximately $0.05 dilutive to our total non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4. Second, as in prior years, seasonality plays a large role in determining our Fourth Quarter financial performance. We typically see higher-than-normal traffic for our large media customers and from seasonal online retail activity for our e-commerce customers, which are both difficult to predict.  With that in mind, we're projecting Q4 revenue in the range of $883 million to $908 million or up 4% to 7% as reported or 5% to 8% in constant currency over Q4 2020 Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $3 million impact on Q4 revenue compared to Q3 levels, and a negative $6 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%.  Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $290 to $297 million. We anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of approximately 43% to 44%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $120 to $121 million. factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% for Q4. Moving on to capex, we expect to spend approximately $128 to $133 million excluding equity compensation in the fourth quarter.  This represents less than 15% of anticipated total revenue. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.37 to $1.44. The CPS guidance assumes taxes of $38 to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 14.5%.  That also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we are raising our guidance. We now expect revenue of $3.439 billion to $3.464 billion, which is up 8% year-over-year as reported, or up 7% in constant currency. We now expect security revenue growth to be in the mid-20% range for the full year 2021. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.63 to $5.69. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 14.5%. They fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. Finally, full-year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 16% of revenue, consistent with our prior guidance. We are very pleased to deliver another quarter of excellent financial results, and we look forward to closing out a strong 2021. Thank you. Tom and I will be happy to take your questions, Operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of James Fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. James Fish : Hey, guys, nice quarter. Thanks for the questions. A couple of your competitors are starting to get a little bit louder on the security side with getting a foot in the door with government and 0 trust architectures so, I guess my question is, how was the federal vertical for you this quarter, and what will it take for Akamai to become more a part of those conversations, especially when you guys already do service some government stuff? Tom Leighton : Our government business is very strong, particularly in security. We defend most -- all the major agencies in the government, pretty much every branch of the military. So, I would say we have a very strong business there. James Fish : All right. And then on Guard core, how long until the 100-plus reps are likely selling the entire security portfolio? And really also any update to the go-to-market onto security standalone sales with channel partners, as well as what you guys are doing to target developers better with Edge applications. Thanks, guys. Ed Mc Gowan : Yeah, hey Jim, it's Ed. I'll take the first one and then maybe Tom can follow up on the developers. But in terms of the sales force, we're going to maintain the sales force that we acquired from Guard core. This is pretty typical what we do with our acquisitions. They will be primarily in an overlay function. It's a little bit different of a sale. Very similar to some of our enterprise sales and we just we'll build out that team a bit.  Probably takes maybe a year or so as the rep start to introduce Guard core into their accounts that they begin to get comfortable with selling Guard core. That's been our typical model, so I think we've got a pretty good -- acquired a great team from Guard core and we just combine that with our existing enterprise sales team. And then as far as channels go, we did pick up a few channel partners as a result of Guard core and we're still actively out recruiting more and more channel partners. Tom Leighton : And in terms of the developer focused question, we've done a lot of work to make our platform be very accessible to developers. A lot of efforts there and strong progress. And in fact, on a daily basis, we're now spinning up about 5 billion applications on Edge workers and that's every day. So strong adoption of our capabilities in terms of Edge computing. Tom Barth : Operator, next question. Operator : Yes, thank you. Next question comes the line of Sterling Auty from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. You gave us the security growth on a constant currency. But can you give us a sense of what it was on an organic constant currency basis. And Tom, you had highlighted a number of different areas and strengthened DDoS, etc. What was the tip of the sphere that drove the growth, this quarter in particular? Ed Mc Gowan : So, the organic security growth in constant currency should be about 22%, so odds will be added about 3 points of growth. Tom you want to take the other part? Tom Leighton : Yeah. And the strength was really across all of our product categories. All of them growing at close to 20% or more. Infrastructure doing well, app and API protection. Fraud, well into close to 30% growth, and access, the best of all. And of course, that will get a lot stronger now, with Guard core and the ransomware solution. So, it's across-the-board in security. Sterling Auty : That's great. And maybe one really quick one. Given the contribution you're expecting from Guard core in Q4, does that mean that the run rate in terms of what the contribution in '22 might actually be better than what you thought at the time of the acquisition? Ed Mc Gowan : Yeah. Hey, Sterling, 2 points on that, so yes, I think we should see better contribution from Guard core and also, we've been off to a pretty good start here in the first couple of weeks since we closed the acquisition rate, they finished very strong. I was very impressed to see several multimillion-dollar deals, in several different verticals across the different GOs. We saw a couple in the U.S., a couple in EMEA and APJ, we saw deals and transportation which isn't really a huge vertical for Akamai as well as other verticals were strong in like insurance and finance. So off to a pretty good start, pretty optimistic so far, and I do think they'll contribute a bit more next year. We'll give you a full guidance on our next call for next year, but so far off to a pretty good start. Sterling Auty : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Michael Elias : Hi, this is Michael on for Colby. 2 questions if I may. First, as you think about the incremental security offerings that could make sense to add via M&A moving forward, what comes to mind? And then the second, what are you seeing from the customer verticals that have been more heavily impacted by the pandemic as we go into the holiday season? Thank you. Tom Leighton : Yes. We continue to look and invest in new capabilities and security, both organically and through M&A. As we talked about, tape integrity manager released in the last year, very exciting technology. Going forward we have account protector, there's a lot of customer interest there. And then early next year, audience hijacking protection. I think that's -- a lot of customers have asked for that and that stops malware plug-ins from stealing or hijacking their audience right before the point-of-sale or the transaction is executed.  Obviously, in the Access segment, I think that's a huge area of future growth. Really excited about the Guard core acquisition that combines very nicely with our 0 trust solutions that combines with enterprise application access to give you the full combination of North Southeast, West will be compelling in the market. So, we're continuing to invest across the board and a portion of the existing solutions that -- we continually work on those to add features, stay ahead of the new attack vectors. So, it's not just like you building a web app firewall, you're constantly adding new capabilities to it to stay ahead of the attackers to keep our customers safe. Ed Mc Gowan : And then on your second question? [Indiscernible] Yes. Sure. On the second question was around the verticals that were impacted and if you recall we out commerce and travel. I would say in travel we're starting to see a bit of improvement there, we're starting to see traffic pick up a little bit. As a reminder, that's above 4% of our total revenue, so it doesn't have a huge impact in terms of what we're seeing as far as an improvement, but it's good to see that that's starting to pick up a little bit.  Commerce, I would say is pretty mixed. We're seeing good strength in security, still seeing some pressure, especially in the U.S. Commerce vertical. That's a much bigger vertical. That's around 15% of total revenue. So, we're not quite out of the woods yet with commerce, again, especially in the U.S. That's the area that we're probably seeing the most weakness, and that's still persisting from the pandemic. Michael Elias : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Weiss : Just wanted to thank you guys for taking the question. Two areas that I was hoping to dig into. Could you talk to the disparity in growth between the U.S. and international? I thought it had more to do historically with platform customers in the U.S. under performing, but now the platform customers are actually doing really well and growing pretty well. So, I [Indiscernible] on why the U.S. is still under performing international regions. And then, a second question on the operating margin side of the equation, any guideline you could give us and how we should think about calendar year 22. Are there kind of a lot of companies are talking to us? Reiteration, if you will, or maybe more spending on travel and people come back to the office and marketing events, ramping back up. On the flip side of the equation, you\u2019ve been kind of under-spending on CapEx versus the original target, and that's coming down as a percentage of revenue. So perhaps there's some gross margin benefit that you could see in calendar '22. It's a good offset that. So, any kind of sense you can give us on how to start thinking about calendar '22 margins? Ed Mc Gowan : Sure. Well, I'll start with the second part on margin. So yes, you're correct. Next year, we'll be expecting that we should start traveling again, so it'll be a little bit more OpEx there. You're right to call it CapEx as I think the team is doing a fantastic job on a lot of CapEx efficiency projects that we've got going with both software and hardware. Being able to drive that down you would expect that CapEx to be back to those normal levels that we've seen, maybe even a touch lower. So that impacts your depreciation, but it takes a while for that to flow through the model. I'm sure you won't get a ton of benefit of that right away, but certainly down the road you will.  I have given some prior guidance when we had the Guardicore call about operating in the 29% to 30% range for next year. And then hopefully getting back, or we will get back to over 30% in '23. Obviously, we'll update you. I mentioned earlier to Sterling that Guardicore contribution probably a bit better than what we said earlier on. I don't have a number to call out yet, so that'll obviously help out the operating margins a touch there. And then you asked about U.S. and international and the disparity between the two.  I sort of flip it around and say that it's not so much the U.S. being weak, but really just strong international growth. U.S. is low single-digit. I mentioned on the previous question that's where we're having the most trouble with our U.S. commerce vertical, which are pretty significant vertical in the U.S. and then we also have a lot of large media customers that are in the U.S. and that's where you tend to see more of the splitting of traffic and pricing pressure. So those things combined sort of put a little bit of pressure in terms of the growth rate in the U.S. but, really the strength outside the U.S. is something that I think is a significant advantage for us. We made a lot of investments both in the network and the sales teams, etc. and we've been able to drive pretty significant growth. Very happy with what I'm seeing in terms of participation, or as strong growth in countries like Korea, Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, I mean across-the-board, we're seeing very strong growth. Latin America, in particular has been very strong. We made an acquisition there a couple of years ago, start to get some good scale out of that. A little bit of a mixed picture in the U.S. with some challenges in commerce. But really, I have looked at it as just very strong international presence and growth. Keith Weiss : Got it. I mean, should the take away be that like -- if we just looked at the security side of the equation. The growth in U.S. and international be more even on the security side of equation than it would on the Edge Tech side? Ed Mc Gowan : Yes, I think that's a good way to look at the key. If I look at in the web performance, especially in commerce, that's where the primary challenge is right now. But if I look at security, obviously the U.S. was the first to adopt. We're still seeing very, very strong growth, and as matter of fact, 67% of our customers are buying 1 security product, 34% are buying 2. If you put that into perspective in a year, we've gone up 6 points in terms of security adoption for the customer base. That's adding over 600 customers. So, we're seeing good broad-based strength in security, both here in the U.S. and also internationally. But I think you're thinking about it in the right way in terms of having strong security growth in both regions. Keith Weiss : Got it. Excellent. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Breen from William Blair. Your line is now open. James Breen : Thanks for taking the question. Just on the cash flow side, it seemed like strictly strong quarter given some of the improvements you've had, the network and just expense control in general. How do we -- how should we think about that cash flow going forward? Is this a particular strong quarter? And it can tend, tend to drift down over time or is it going to be lumpy or are we at a sort of a new run rate in terms of cash generation? Thanks. Ed Mc Gowan : Yes, great question, Jim. Q1 tend be the lower quarter from a cash flow perspective just because of working capitals, when you say your bonus is off. But I think if you peg your CapEx to that 15% range, you're looking at pretty significant improvements. I think if you use that as your guide, working off the operating margins we gave you and think about Q1 as probably being a low point as you're modeling out your free cash flow. But yeah, very, very strong free cash flow generation this quarter for sure. James Breen : Great, thanks. And then just one other one. As you look at the revenue growth, excluding the platform customers, the platform customers were down about 3 million sequentially. Is there a range now where you feel like in the sort of low 60's range where that revenue is going to hover for those companies given the amount of growth you've seen in the last 12 to 18 months from that? Tom Leighton : Yeah, I think that's probably not a bad place to peg it Jim. Q4 always tends to be a bit of a stronger quarter and that verticals, a little bit of seasonality there. You always have renewals. So, whenever you have a renewal, you'll see it pull back a couple of million dollars depending on the timing and that sort of stuff. But I think [Indiscernible] it's been a low 60's, it's probably a decent place to peg it. James Breen : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Frank Louthan : Yeah. Great. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the buybacks you said you'd opportunistically use that take advantage of the market valuation. What levels seem appropriate here. It's kind of the first question and I've got a follow-up. Tom Leighton : Primarily, we've used the equity buyback to offset the equity dilution from employee grants. And from time-to-time, we do buy back additional shares and we've seen that over the years. And we use that approach such that as the stock price declines, we will buy back more. Ed Mc Gowan : And I do feel that in this market, Akamai has a very strong presence, both in CDN and security. Our security business growing at 25% on a very big number. And I do feel that Akamai is worth lower in this market. And so, you may see us buyback additional shares, especially depending on how the stock price fluctuates. Frank Louthan : Alright, great. And then, you've done a good job adding together some M&A for the secure -- on the security side, any other tools do you think you need to make yourself more competitive in the market? Do you feel like you've got kind of the right mix here to -- for that product set? Tom Leighton : Yeah, we're always looking at new capabilities as I mentioned. And of course, the attackers are always innovating with new forms of attack. But I am very excited about the Guardicore acquisition and I think it really does fill out and complete our access story, our ability to stop ransomware and malware. As I mentioned, we already have capabilities that prevent the malware from getting in. Enterprise Application Access in particular governs what employees can touch and access and even then, it has to come through Akamai's application firewall, so we're making sure that malware doesn't come in. We also have multi-factor authentication which make sure that the employee is who they say they are. And now we're -- Guardicore, we stopped the spread of the malware if it does get in. And there are a lot of ways the into the enterprise today. It is really -- despite all the defenses you put in place, somebody for example, in the capital pipeline case, a password or potential gets out there.  Now we still have ways of catching that somebody is using a stolen credential, but malware does get in still, and so the real key there is stopping the spread, and that's what Guardicore does. And so now I think it's really nice because you stopped the ransomware with Guardicore, but we've got the whole package in whole solution now. And I think that's really unique in the marketplace and very exciting. Frank Louthan : Alright, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. And good evening, everyone. I have two questions as well up near the first one I was hoping you could talk about. As I look at the midpoint of the guide for December of is there a way to think about how are you thinking about seasonality in Edge and security? In the bottom, are you going to get through the security numbers may imply a much more severe deceleration than what people are modeling. So, I just love to understand how are you assuming those two segments stacking up in the December quarter. Ed Mc Gowan : Yeah. Sure, I'll take that. We'll start with the Edge. Obviously, Edge, is quite a busy quarter in Q4. As I talked about, seasonality from e-commerce, I think it's obviously a tougher quarter to call here with some supply chain disruptions and things like that. Does that drive more or less Internet traffic, and what does that holiday season look like? Typically, a very strong media quarter where you see new devices, and games coming online -- I'm sorry. Devices, consoles, etc. coming online.  And then you also have a lot of sporting events in Q4, back-to-school, you've got lots of game releases, so it can be a pretty robust season for us and obviously challenging to call I looked at the events calendar, it's pretty full, so provided we can see some good traffic, you can see good upside we delivered that in the last couple of years. In terms of security, it\u2019s not stopped as seasonal.  Certainly, there are some bundles we have where there is -- traffic can impact that a bit but, I think to take our security guidance, we've been pretty conservative in the way that we've approached security, and we've been over-delivering every quarter. I think, with that obviously Guardicore is off to a good start so I wouldn't imply that as a seasonal down tick or anything like that in our security growth. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then if I could follow-up the CapEx number for September quarter and really for December as well. I mean, capex as a percent of sales, I think will be 14, 15% for the back half of the year, versus 19%, 20% of the last several quarters prior to that up. I'm curious. Is capex coming down because you feel like there's enough capacity you have out there and you can see that lower or is it more that you just can't get your hands on the supply chain and the products and need to drive capex. I'm trying to understand what's taking capex lower, and then how do I think about this as we go into 2022? Ed Mc Gowan : Yes. I would say it's good execution. And if anything, with the supply chain, we're not seeing supply chain disruptions in terms of the fact that we actually, if you remember a few calls ago, we talked about in the pandemic, we took capex up and we were pretty cautious in terms of making sure that we had plenty of extra capacity available for -- if you see the pandemic continue and see traffic growth, etc. So, we learned in, we built up our inventory a bit, we fund a lot of small equipment so that we're not concerned right now anyway with the supply chain. So, I'd say that's part of what's driving it as we built out ahead of demand, we're pretty smart in the way we did that.  But also, I mentioned there's a number of CapEx efficiencies that Adam and his team are working on. Not only just software, but network design, deployment optimization, looking at different hardware improvements, and just to anyway to drive a good focus on lowering our need for capex and also keep in mind we have great relationships with the networks and ISP. So, in terms of doing optimization inside of their networks, are able to do that as well. So, I'd say it's really a great execution on the team's part, and CapEx has come down pretty significantly, you see that in our free cash flow results. Amit Daryanani : Does that sustain next year? This mid-teens CapEx as a percent of sales, is that the right way to model this out? Ed Mc Gowan : Yes. Right now [Indiscernible] you see another pandemic or some major events and we see some crazy unexpected traffic growth, yeah, I think it's a sustainable number, certainly going into next year. I don't want to get into giving guidance, but I think that I talked about in the past that we'd be getting back to this level and we're actually operating a little bit better than that. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria from RBC. Your line is now open. Rishi Jaluria : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. And nice to see security growth hold up and actually accelerate with this quarter. 2 questions. First, I wanted to go a little bit deeper on the supply chain issues. I appreciate you've obviously over invested capacity with the OTT launches and the pandemic last year. You seem pretty well insulated from the rising cost, but at what point that this continues dragging out, does it begin to become a worry, and you might have to overspend in order to keep capacity and not have to turn away business?  And maybe related to that. As we think about the environment heading into Q4, how do we expect that to shake out, especially given Q4 is such a -- traditionally such a strong commerce season? A lot of companies are telling us they're not going to able to meet demand. especially when it comes to electronic goods. So, is that a worry that you have, and maybe how are you thinking about embedding that in your guidance? Thank you. Ed Mc Gowan : Yes. So, I'll take the second part first. You know, that's why we give a pretty wide range. I just mentioned on the last question that, it's hard to predict what the commerce season looks like. And obviously, when you are in the business of delivering Internet traffic, one model could suggest that, well, shelves are not stocked. People are doing more surfing to find things. Another model would suggest that there's not as much shopping and people are giving cash and gift cards. Hard to tell, but we did put out a pretty big range there. Also keep in mind that a lot of our Commerce customers, about half of our Commerce customers have taken, we call our 0 overage, so you've kind of flattened out that first thing.  So, the bursting for commerce is not as big of an impact if we're still has an impact. In terms of the device cycle, that's an interesting one. We do expect and we have seen over the last several years, especially in the last couple of weeks of the year, as new devices come online as a lot of firmware updates and things like that, I still expect to see that, but there's other things that are not as dependent on that, for example, gaming releases, new video content that comes out if you don't have a new machine, you're watching it on your old machine. So, I still think that we'll have a pretty big immediate quarter for sure.  That's why I've given a pretty wide range to try to take those things into consideration. And then on your supply chain question you had asked about, when does this become a problem? That's funny. I asked the same questions to my team as we go through our capex build-out. We've done a nice job of building out several quarters\u2019 worth of inventory here, and we've diversified our supply chain. And the team's done a good job of ensuring that we're not seeing any significant increase in price or anything like that.  A little bit on the freight side, but it's not really material and I think that should start to work itself out. But if we do see another massive growth and traffic, maybe we should start to run into some problems, but so far so good. And like I said, the team did a really good job preparing, not expecting this type of a disruption in the supply chain, but expecting that the result from the pandemic would last a lot longer. So, we did some scenario planning, so we're in pretty good shape at the moment. Rishi Jaluria : That's really helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is now open. Alex Henderson : Thanks. Looking at the guidance and the commentary, it does sound like your security businesses exp - if I add in some of the inorganic, that would imply even lower growth. Is it reasonable to think that the security business can sustain a 20% growth rate organically in '22 or is that too aggressive of an expectation for a billion three business? Ed Mc Gowan : Yes, I think one thing to keep in mind, Alex, is you've got the anniversary of [Indiscernible] Southern Europe, your growth rate lapse in Q4 for [Indiscernible] and then we got in Guardicore. We've said in the -- when we did our analyst data that we expected to be able to grow 20% [Indiscernible] 3 to 5 years with acquisitions being part of the strategy. And you can see that the Guardicore acquisition with the prior guidance, and a couple of points of growth. We obviously did much better this year than we expected going into the year.  Security has over performed every single quarter. We still feel pretty comfortable with our 20% growth rate as we talked about, as a matter of fact coming out of this year we're doing a bit better than that. So, I think, if you're taking the super all end of the range, maybe you could come up with that formula, but we're expecting pretty solid growth here over the security in Q4. Tom Leighton : Yes. Our strategy in security is to combine organic development, we have intelligence, and timely acquisitions. And we'll continue to do that. And of course, when you buy a Company after a year, its growth becomes organic and it's no longer counted as an acquisition growth per se, and I think we've had a really great track record of doing that in security, going back all the way to Prolexic acquisition in 2014. And as I mentioned, I think Guardicore is fundamentally like that in terms of really transforming our enterprise security business, just like Prolexic transformed our DDoS business, which of course today is very, very successful.  We're the market leader by far and our goal is to do that on the Enterprise Security side to things like stopping ransomware and stopping malware. And as we -- as Ed said, as we continue to want to grow our security business over the longer term at 20+% that we'll include acquisitions, and I think acquisitions are a good thing. It gives you a jump start on technology, an important area. Guardicore has been working for a long time to develop their micro-segmentation approach. I believe it is market getting what they do. They're the best folks out there, and now we have the benefit of all of the years of effort that they put into that at a perfect time. Because a lot of companies are rightly worried about stopping ransomware and now Akamai's in a position to help them do that. And of course, it sits with a lot of our organic development on technology around EAA. It's an ideal combination. So, we'll continue to do both and in working hard to continue to our security growth that Alex Henderson : Okay. I get it. Thanks. That's helpful. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing environment, whether there's been any change in competitive landscape, have you seen more competition or less competition? How should we think about the environment? I think we're also seeing enterprise is spending more this year. Do you think that that sustains into 2022 given the first half of spike in an attack caused a flurry of spending intentions? Ed Mc Gowan : I think the competitive environment is very similar to what it's been in the past. It's -- it is a very competitive environment. Across-the-board from Cloud giants who are also our largest customers, all the way down to startups. Obviously, CDN is a mature environment. competitively, and so I don't see there's any fundamental change there. Security is really a great environment for us. We're the market leader by far in the core areas of defending and protecting websites, applications, and APIs, The leader by far and DDoS prevention. And those are areas that have a lot of attacks taking place. And now, the new category for us where we're going to encounter new competition because we're moving into that space in a big way would be Tom Leighton : enterprise security. We already have a very strong access solution there. And now we have what we believe is the best solution to stop ransomware for with micro-segmentation. And by adding that to Akamai, we now have a new set of competitors there, because we're entering their space and we think there's a lot of potential gain for Akamai there, and ability to help major enterprises. Alex Henderson : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Brandon Nispel : Awesome. Thank you for taking the question. Could you unpack the growth in the Edge Technology Group, please? What was the growth in the quarter for Edge applications, and what does that imply for the growth in the Edge delivery business? And then how do you expect these two segments within that larger group to trend exiting the year? Thanks. Ed Mc Gowan : So, Brian, we're not going to breakout Edge apps every quarter. We talked about it last time growing at over 30%, and we think that business can continue to sustain that. I think we'll exit the year on a run rate over $200 million, which is a pretty good healthy growth rate there. And then just the -- again, we're not breaking out the Edge delivery business this quarter, we'll do it at the end of the year. Brandon Nispel : If I could just follow up on that when you back out some of the one-time items that are affecting comparability and the Edge technology business specifically, I think India apps and you're still lapping. Is that business growing? And what's going to cause that business to return to growth next year? Thanks. Ed Mc Gowan : Yes. So, it's obviously a just a tougher compare. This is the First Quarter that we don't have that compare and you saw that we were roughly flat in terms of total Edge Tech. I think as we get into next year, it's an easier compare. I think we're comfortable with our longer-term growth, a low single-digits for the Edge business over time, obviously. With the Edge applications business much faster growing as that becomes more material that could change the growth rate. I think it's just continued execution and traffic growth going into next year on a much easier to compare, I think you'll start to see a bit of growth rate pick up a little bit there. Tom Leighton : Okay, thank you, everyone. In closing we'll be presenting at a number of investor conferences and road shows throughout the rest of the fourth quarter. And details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. We appreciate you joining us, and all of us here at Akamai wish continued good health to you and yours, and have a great evening. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tom Barth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Fourth Quarter 2021 and Acquisition of Linode Conference Call. Before we get started with the Linode acquisition that we just announced, today's earnings call format will be a bit different than normal. We will be presenting slides and associated content, and the link to the webcast can be found in the Events section of our Investor Relations website. We plan to post the full slide deck following the call, and I am now on Slide 2. As you can see from our agenda, speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; Adam Karon, Akamai's Chief Operating Officer and General Manager of the Edge Technology Group; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Moving to Slide 3. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. While I don\u2019t intend to read this slide, these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and then involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. These factors include uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from unexpected geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent company's view on February 15, 2022. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section at akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom, and he'll start on Slide 4. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Today is a very exciting day for Akamai. This afternoon, we announced that we've signed a definitive agreement to acquire Linode. We see this as a tremendous opportunity for Akamai and we believe that it will be transformational as we expand our business into adjacent markets, become more strategic for our customers and accelerate our growth and evolution as a company. We'll talk more about Linode in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to review some of the highlights from a very strong Q4 and 2021. Turning to Slide 5. Q4 revenue was $905 million, up 7% year-over-year. Our revenue growth was driven by the continued strong demand for our security products as well as our fast-growing Edge applications business. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 31%, up 1 point over Q4 in 2020. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1.49 per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year. For the full year, revenue was $3.46 billion, up 8% over 2020. We expanded non-GAAP operating margin to 32% last year, and we achieved this result while investing for future growth. Non-GAAP EPS last year was $5.74, up 10% over 2020. 2021 was also a very strong year for cash generation at Akamai. We generated $859 million in free cash flow last year, an increase of 78% over 2020. I think it's important to note that our excellent cash generation has allowed us to make strategic acquisitions like Guardicore in Q4 and now Linode to fuel our future growth while also returning capital to shareholders. In Q4, we spent $271 million to buy back just over 2.4 million shares of stock. Over the course of the full year, we spent $522 million to buy back approximately 4.7 million shares. Our primary use of cash is for M&A and offsetting the dilution from our equity compensation programs. Over the past 10 years, Akamai has also engaged in opportunistic buybacks that have resulted in a reduction of our fully diluted share count by about 12%. Last quarter, security products continued their rapid growth, generating revenue of $365 million, up 23% year-over-year. For the full year, security revenue reached $1.33 billion and grew 26% over 2020. Security represented 39% of our revenue last year, up from 33% in 2020. In recent years, Akamai has built one of the world's leading cloud security businesses. Our security solutions are highly differentiated and recognized as best in class by our customers, who rely on Akamai to protect their most important digital assets from very determined and highly capable attackers. Results in Q4 were especially strong for our Bot Manager solution, which helps to defend against a wide range of automated attacks. Our new Account Protector solution, which provides account takeover protection, also performed very well in Q4 in only its second quarter of availability. Our web app firewall offerings also posted excellent results in Q4. And Akamai was recognized as a leader in Gartner's 2021 Magic Quadrant for web application and API protection, scoring the highest of 11 vendors in ability to execute. In October, we acquired Guardicore to extend our Zero Trust solutions to help stop the spread of ransomware. As a part of Akamai, Guardicore has continued its strong growth momentum and closed major deals last quarter at one of the largest freight railways in the U.S. and at one of the largest telecommunication companies in South America. We're very excited about the value that Guardicore's micro-segmentation capabilities bring to our customers. And as Ed will talk about shortly, we now believe that Guardicore will drive significantly more revenue this year than we'd initially forecast when we announced the transaction last fall. Our CDN business generated revenue of $541 million in Q4, down 2% from Q4 in 2020. Traffic on our platform continued to be strong in Q4, peaking at over 200 terabits per second. Our Edge application solutions had a great Q4, exiting the year with an annualized revenue run rate of more than $200 million and growing 30% for the full year. Our Akamai EdgeWorkers solution was adopted by a top sporting equipment company, a global business travel service and one of the largest banks in the U.S. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance last year on both the top and bottom lines. We achieved our goals in 2021 and then some. And I want to thank our employees for delivering such strong results as they continue to cope with the challenges of the pandemic. I'll now move on to Slide 6. As many of you know, Akamai's mission is to power and protect life online. And our purpose in dong that is to make life better for billions of people, billions of times a day. Akamai has been doing this for more than 20 years, enabled in part by a series of market-defining innovations, starting with the invention of content delivery networks in the late 1990s. As you can see on the next slide, #7, we follow this breakthrough in Internet technology with fundamental advances in video streaming, application acceleration and web security. In each of these areas, Akamai was a major pioneer in enabling new capabilities. And in each of these areas, we're still the market leader today by far. Throughout the past 20 years, we've also been a pioneer and a leader in edge computing, beginning with the invention of Edge Side Includes in the early 2000s, a technology that's still used by thousands of our customers today. And now turning to Slide 8. We're taking the next major step in our evolution by creating the world's most distributed compute platform from cloud to edge, making it easier for developers and businesses to build, run and secure their applications online. As you can see in this afternoon's press release, we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Linode, it\u2019s a privately held company that makes cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible.  Linode is known for its developer-friendly services, the quality of their support and as a trusted Infrastructure-as a-Service platform provider. By combining Linode's developer-centric cloud advantages with Akamai's deep enterprise strengths, we believe that we can provide tremendous value to developers and enterprises as they build cloud applications on Akamai. We see plenty of opportunity for a differentiated offering among customers who desire ease of use, wider reach beyond just a few POPs, lower latency, stronger security and greater resiliency, all from a single platform and all at an affordable price point. Akamai's highly distributed edge platform has the global reach to enable any cloud application to deliver the best end-user experience anywhere that users or services consume apps, from the cloud to the edge, where more compute services will live as 5G and IoT take hold and expand. The Akamai platform is uniquely suited for workloads that require high throughput, low latency and instant scalability on demand. Akamai has been perfecting this capability for many years, and it's very hard to do. Akamai also has the capabilities needed to integrate seamlessly with both DIY cloud apps and third-party cloud vendors as part of the larger cloud ecosystem. We believe that this flexibility will appeal to enterprises that want a multi-vendor cloud strategy to mitigate their vendor concentration risk and to ensure resiliency and seamless availability in case one vendor service experiences an outage. And with Akamai's category-leading security solutions, customers will be able to secure their apps from their point of origin to the edge, all under Akamai's protective umbrella. Security delivered at the edge offers unique advantages since it enables customers to manage security policies across all their apps and infrastructure wherever they're located. We believe that such an end-to-end security approach will appeal to customers who want increased efficiency and greater resiliency along with lower security risk. The net of all this is that we believe that Akamai and Linode can solve customers' needs in ways that are not addressed in the market today, forming a powerful winning combination that will enable customers to build, deliver and secure their apps on the platform that powers and protects life online. Moving to Slide 9. We see the acquisition of Linode as a transformational opportunity for Akamai. This slide shows the way that we presented our business at our Investor Day last year. With Linode, Akamai will expand beyond security and delivery into the world's most distributed cloud services provider with leading solutions for security, delivery and compute, as shown here on Slide 10. We'll offer customers a breadth and depth of services uncommon in the cloud space today, a massive content delivery platform, the best application performance, easy-to-use cloud and edge compute and category-leading security solutions, all backed by expert services and support professionals to help power and protect life online. Given that we're announcing this acquisition at the same time as our earnings, I thought it would be helpful to have Adam Karon join us on the call today to talk more about Linode. Adam is our COO, and he's responsible for running our compute and delivery businesses. Later this year, we'll also plan to hold an Investor Day, when you'll be able to hear from Mani Sundaram, who leads our security business, as well as from other Akamai executives. After Adam speaks, Ed will cover the financial aspects of the acquisition and provide our outlook for 2022. Adam? Adam Karon : Thanks, Tom. I'll start on Slide 12. Tom just spoke about the 3 core product pillars we have at Akamai : security, delivery and compute. I\u2019m going focus a bit deeper into the compute portfolio and what we think it will look like after the integration of Linode. Turning to Slide 13. I'll start with the existing Linode product portfolio, which is split into 4 product groupings, the first being compute, which has offerings like dedicated and shared CPUs, BareMetal, GPUs and Kubernetes; the next being storage, which provides services like block storage, object storage and a managed database service in beta; next, cloud orchestration; and finally, an award-winning set of developer tools that make it really easy for developers to use their platform. Their products are sold in traditional cloud models using online trials and online purchases. Turning to Slide 14. After the acquisition closes, the Akamai compute product portfolio we envision would consist of 5 product groupings : the first being compute inherited from Linode, containing shared and dedicated CPUs, GPUs, Kubernetes; storage, which would contain the block and object storage that came from Linode but would also now include Akamai's net storage; we have cloud optimization that would include Akamai's Global Traffic Manager, Cloud Wrapper and Direct Connect solutions; next, the developer tools we get from Linode as well as the existing Akamai developer tools now make the Akamai compute platform easy and accessible to developers all over the world; and last, but certainly not least, our Edge applications, which contain our EdgeWorkers and EdgeKV products that execute compute right at our edge. It will also include our Cloudlet's image and video manager and, of course, our API acceleration product. One of the exciting synergies would be in go-to-market. Akamai's compute products would not only be sold online, but because our current globally located enterprise sales force works closely with the buyers for cloud compute, they have the right relationships, and we would not need to create an overlay sales force. Another exciting go-to-market synergy would be our existing robust and global channel ecosystem that could also take these cloud compute offerings to market. And in both cases, new wallet share within the customer base could be open for future growth. Turning to Slide 15. Now let's talk about how we think about compute. Now computing at the edge or near end users and devices brings unique benefits for critical use cases that are in many locations and where data is in motion or ephemeral, whereas computing in the cloud brings other benefits that are usually for applications running in a smaller number of locations and where data is stored and persistent. Our combined platform would have both edge and cloud computing. And since modern applications are built as a collection of services, each with differing compute needs and data needs, only by combining the edge and cloud can we fulfill the varied needs of our customer base like data localization and low-latency containerized compute as well as more typical compute needs that are persistent and in fewer locations. The unique capabilities can come together when we are able to combine Akamai's Edge platform with Linode's cloud computing capabilities and then add in our Global Traffic Manager product to route across multiple clouds and cloud locations our global large private network that efficiently connects cloud and edge locations and messaging, bringing it all together, coordinating cloud and edge services. You end up with the world's most distributed compute platform from cloud to edge making it easier for developers and businesses to build, run and secure applications. Now on Slide 16. While Linode and Akamai can solve a number of customer use cases separately, I thought it would be useful to cover just a few examples of the use cases we believe we can help fulfill for our customers with this unique combination of products. In the sports vertical, you could imagine a sports league could leverage the new Akamai platform to deploy WebRTC services to enable a watch-along app that allows a group of friends to watch a game in sync while communicating with each other in real time. And they would be able to do that using our distributed VMs, load balancing and high-throughput egress. When you think of IoT and fleet management, you could see a shipping company building a distributed app to collect and parts video and telemetry data from trucks and route before backhauling the data to their data warehouse. And they'd be able to do that using our support of MQTT, our distributed VMs and direct connect capabilities. An e-commerce site can leverage Akamai to dynamically personalize their site based on the user's previous and current browsing activity without having to go back to their data lake, all using our managed database services, Kubernetes and Functions as a Service. In the metaverse, we can help create a persistent virtual experience when a game studio needs to connect users from across the globe in a fully immersive VR experience from any console, mobile device or browser, all using our distributed GPUs, low-latency and private backbone. And in health care, a hospital could leverage Akamai to create a platform that captures and archives videos of surgical procedures to help train doctors on new and emerging techniques using Bare Metal and our Object Storage. Now turning to Slide 17. The combination of Akamai and Linode can be a truly unique offering in the market. We plan to combine the ease of use and developer-friendliness Linode is known for with the wider reach, lower latency, strong security and greater resiliency that are Akamai's hallmarks. We expect our new combined offering to appeal to developers by offering core cloud compute functionality, ease of use and tools they need appeal to enterprises with security, uptime and reliability and drive future use cases as new applications can take advantage of the throughput performance and distribution of a market-leading global network. Turning to Slide 18. So with Akamai and Linode, we can have highly secure, elastic compute along with storage capabilities on the world's largest edge network, category-leading security, an edge computing platform for latency-sensitive workloads, all on Akamai's large global private network with a globally located enterprise sales force and robust channel ecosystem, all setting us up to win in the marketplace. And now I'll pass it to Ed to discuss the transaction details. Ed McGowan : Thank you, Adam. I will start my remarks with brief highlights of our very strong Q4 results, then provide some insight into the financial aspects of the Linode acquisition and then close with our Q1 and full year 2022 guidance. So moving to Slide 20. Starting with the Q4 highlights. We are very pleased with our strong Q4 results, capping off an excellent year for Akamai. Q4 revenue was $905 million, up 7% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency. Revenue was led by another quarter of very strong growth in security as well as strength in our edge applications business. Security revenue growth in Q4 was 23% year-over-year or 25% in constant currency, with Guardicore contributing revenue of approximately $10 million. We are very pleased with the initial momentum we've seen from Guardicore as well as the continued growth of the pipeline. It is also worth noting that our Edge Applications business surpassed a $200 million annual revenue run rate in Q4 and grew 30% for the full year in 2021. International revenue growth was another bright spot with revenue increasing 13% year-over-year or 16% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets represented 47% of total revenue in Q4, up 2 points from Q4 2020. These strong results were despite foreign exchange fluctuations, which had a negative impact [Technical Difficulty] basis and negative $10 million on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $243 million or $1.49 of earnings per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year, up 14% in constant currency and $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range. Finally, as Tom mentioned, we had an exceptional year from a cash flow perspective. Moving to capital deployment. During the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $271 million to buy back approximately 2.4 million shares. Our intention is to continue to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic, both M&A and share repurchases. Turning now to Linode on Slide 21. As you heard from Tom and Adam, we believe the combination of Akamai and Linode will create the world's most distributed platform for developers and businesses to build, run and secure their applications. Under the terms of the agreement, Akamai has agreed to acquire Linode in exchange for approximately $900 million of cash. The transaction will be treated as an asset purchase for tax purposes. And as a result, we anticipate significant cash income tax savings over the next 15 years. While this benefit will not impact our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we estimate the present value of these savings to be approximately $120 million. Turning to Slide 22. We believe that Linode currently has a very attractive financial profile and that there are considerable revenue and cost synergy opportunities in the future. Assuming a late Q1 close, in 2022, we expect the acquisition to : add revenue of approximately $100 million, have no material impact to our non-GAAP operating margin and be accretive to non-GAAP EPS by $0.05 to $0.06 per share. Looking beyond this year, we expect Linode to be additive to our non-GAAP operating margin as we continue to capitalize on revenue and cost synergies, including leveraging our go-to-market channel and marketing organizations to accelerate revenue from enterprise customers, realizing significant cost savings by utilizing our very large global private network that Adam previously talked about as well as leveraging our significant scale and supply chain along with our network deployment expertise. From a CapEx perspective, we expect Linode to add approximately 2 points to CapEx as a percentage of revenue in 2022 as we plan to expand Linode's capacity and locations to meet anticipated customer demand. However, over the long term, we do not expect the acquisition to meaningfully change our previously communicated goal of CapEx being in the mid-teens as a percentage of revenue. Turning to Slide 23. As Tom and Adam previously mentioned, upon closing the acquisition, we plan to update our revenue reporting to reflect 3 separate business groups : security, delivery and compute. The first revenue grouping, security, will remain unchanged from the existing reporting of our Security Technologies Group. The second revenue group will be delivery. Delivery will be comprised of edge delivery and services portion of our existing ETG organization but will exclude our net storage and Edge application businesses that were previously included as part of ETG revenue. For context, our Edge applications business, which had revenue of approximately $196 million in 2021 and our net storage business, which had revenue of approximately $57 million in 2021, will move to our new compute business. The third and final revenue group will be called compute. Compute will include Linode, plus our Edge Applications and Net Storage businesses I just mentioned. We believe that with strong execution, we can deliver more than $500 million of annual compute revenue in 2023. Turning to Slide 24. Before I provide our Q1 and 2022 guidance, I wanted to highlight a couple of factors to consider for your models. First, the Q1 and full year 2022 guidance I am about to provide does not reflect the revenue and non-GAAP EPS contribution we anticipate from Linode that I previously mentioned, since the acquisition has not yet closed. We plan to update our full year guidance to include Linode on the first earnings conference call after the deal has closed. Second, international revenue now represents nearly half of our total revenue. And the dollar has continued to strengthen since we reported in early November. Therefore, we currently expect a meaningful foreign exchange headwind in 2022. At current spot rates, our guidance assumes that foreign exchange will have a negative $45 million impact on revenue on a year-over-year basis. Finally, similar to 2019, we have 8 of our top 10 customers renewing in the first half of the year. As a reminder, we define our top customers as anyone contributing revenue of 1% or more. And that customer -- that group of customers contributed approximately 19% of total revenue in 2021. Although we expect to see a negative impact to revenue growth in the near term, we expect to see incremental revenue over time as these customers' traffic grows with us. I'd also note that while the cluster timing of these renewals is unusual, the pricing, contract terms are consistent with the broader trends in the market, and these renewals have been factored into our guidance. So with all that in mind, turning to our Q1 guidance on Slide 25. We are projecting revenue in the range of $896 million to $910 million or up 6% to 8% as reported or 8% to 10% in constant currency over Q1 2021. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $2 million impact on Q1 revenue compared to Q4 levels and a negative $17 million impact year-over-year.  At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $292 million to $296 million. We anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of approximately 43%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $123 million to $124 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% for Q1. Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $120 million to $124 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the first quarter. This represents approximately 13% to 14% of anticipated total revenue, which is down approximately 4 points from Q1 2021 levels. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.39 to $1.43. This EPS guidance assumes guidance taxes of $38 million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 14.5%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 162 million shares. Moving to Slide 26. Looking ahead to the full year, we expect revenue of $3.673 billion to $3.728 billion, which is up 6% to 8% year over year as reported or 7% to 9% in constant currency. We security revenue growth to be at least 20% for the full year 2022. This includes an expected Guardicore contribution of approximately $50 million to $55 million. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% to 30% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.82 to $5.97. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 14.5%, a fully diluted share count of approximately 162 million shares. Finally, full year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 13% to 14% of revenue. In closing, we are very pleased with our 2021 performance and are excited to close on Linode and help customers build, run and secure their applications. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Tom to say a few words before we take your questions. Tom? Tom Leighton : Thanks, Ed. I'll wrap up now on Slide 28. As I mentioned earlier, Akamai has had a rich and exciting history of innovation that has fundamentally enabled the Internet to provide enormous benefit to billions of people around the world. We are truly making life better for billions of people, billions of times a day. As incredible as Akamai's contributions to the Internet have been, I want you to know that I couldn't be more excited about Akamai's potential for the future as we expand our business with Linode and Guardicore, provide even greater value for our customers and shareholders and make life even better for Internet users everywhere. Ed, Adam and I will now be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : I wondered if you could give us some context in terms of what kind of growth was Linode experiencing before the acquisition? And then when you talked about kind of 2023 and beyond, I want to make sure I understand that new compute area, the $500 million, what kind of growth rate do you expect out of that segment? Ed McGowan : Sterling, this is Ed. Thanks for the question. So before the acquisition, they were growing at about 15%, give or take. The bigger customers were growing faster. And they were sort of containing their growth a bit. It was a very closely held company. So they were holding back a bit on their investment in go-to-market and their build-out. So obviously, that's one of the major synergies we bring. So we think we can accelerate that business pretty considerably. Now when I talked about the different components of the business, if you take the net storage business plus the edge applications business plus where Linode is, assume I talked about how we grew the edge applications business 30%. And if you remember back on Investor Day, that was our long-term target. Our net storage business, as it is today, is kind of a flattish business, kind of grows like the CDN. We expect that to obviously accelerate as we add new capabilities. And then the Linode business should accelerate quite a bit.  So if you were to put those pieces together, and I talked about in '23 that I expected that we would be above $500 million in revenue, that sort of gets you to that 30% to 35% kind of growth rate in that business once you get through the acquisition. Sterling Auty : Right. And then -- but given those pieces, would you expect that growth to be durable at that level or kind of settle back into more of a 15% to 20%, just so we understand the longer-term context? And that's all for me. Ed McGowan : Yes. That's a great question, and I'll ask Adam to chime in a little bit here as well. Obviously, we're getting into a very, very big market. And what pushed us into this market was our customers. We were getting more and more requests for folks to -- continue to come with different use cases. Ourselves, we're spending quite a bit on third-party cloud today, whether it's through acquisitions or through IT projects. Just the overall growth of this market is so significant that we think there's certainly the market there to do that.  I'll let Adam talk a little bit about some of these plans in terms of future integration and the growth prospects going forward. But it's quite possible that, that could be a durable growth rate going forward for that business. Adam Karon : Yes. I agree, Ed. I think we see that market growing very rapidly outside of what Akamai had before, and we see that with our customers in demand of our edge applications and asking us for this type of cloud computing as well. So we do expect it to be durable as that market continues to grow quite rapidly. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Maybe 2 questions. One on the Linode acquisition. I just want to kind of better understand kind of like the buy versus like a partner decision. Can you help us understand what's interesting about sort of buying this asset, what you could do owning sort of Linode versus partnering with Linode or other type of cloud computing platforms out there, number one? And then number two, for Ed, just in looking at FY '22 and the margins coming down. Nice margin performance in Q4 and all throughout 2021. Can you talk to us a little what's going to be pressuring margins into 2022? Tom Leighton : Yes. By owning Linode, we can really scale up that business. We have a lot of expertise in network deployment and doing that in a cost-effective way to get enormous scale. Also, we've got a large enterprise sales force and a customer base that is hungry for us to bring them this kind of capability. We know how to make large-scale systems be reliable and perform well. And we can bring it all together as part of an end-to-end solution so that our customers can take their major applications, build them easily on Akamai, and that's where Linode comes in, run them. Of course, we have the world's largest and best content delivery platform to deliver it, and then wrap it all together under our security umbrella to make sure it stays secure. And so that's a compelling reason for us to make the acquisition here and provide the end-to-end service versus just partnering with the various cloud providers. Ed, do you want to take the margin question? Ed McGowan : Yes. Sure, Keith. And just to add on that, if I just look at the financial profile of the business we just acquired, think about getting up to that sort of scale of revenue, the type of investment you need to make, how long it will take you to get there. It's rare that you find companies that have profitability margins like we do. So to be able to bolt that on, it's immediately accretive, gets us to market much faster, there's a brilliance to the simplicity in terms of how they approach and how simple it is to use their system. That's an expertise that we're acquiring as well. So there's a lot to like about that. Now in terms of the margins. So there's a couple of things going on there. One of the points that I made in my prepared remarks was about foreign exchange. That's a big headwind for us, and we're very profitable outside the U.S. So that does put a little bit of pressure on margins for us. But also, we're making investments. And keep in mind, you have the full Guardicore business. We only had about 2 -- a little over 2 months in the first -- in the fourth quarter. So in the first quarter, we have full Guardicore and we -- cost in the business. And you've got, in the middle of the year is when we do our merit increase. That said, 2 things to point out. Number one, we're going to be -- I said we do about 30% in Q1. We've done very well managing costs. And then we also told you when we did the acquisition of Guardicore that in '23, we'd expect to get above 30% margins again. So will it be expanding margins? Might be slightly under 30% this year. As I said, somewhere between 29% and 30%, but we anticipate to get back above that in '23. Operator : Our next question comes from James Breen with William Blair. James Breen : Just looking at the Edge Technology Group, growth this year has been flattish off of some pretty high numbers from 2020 as a result of the pandemic. As you think about that going forward and with some of the repricing this year, can you just talk about some of the puts and takes relative to repricing some of those contracts as well as some of the sectors that were hit most by the pandemic potentially improving? Ed McGowan : This is Ed. I'll take that one. So yes, as far as the renewals go, as we've talked in the past, whenever we have a combination of renewals, we'll always call it out for you guys. Here's what I would expect with that group of customers : typical renewal pricing, nothing unusual in terms of anything in the market to call out there. I'd expect that group of customers to decline a bit in Q1, decline a bit in Q2 because like about half of the renewals already done. I got about half coming up here in April. And then I would expect that revenue to start to grow again. It's pretty typical of what you see in the CDN business when you have a cluster of renewals. Now those customers have varying contracts. Some of them are 1 year, some of them are 2, some of them are 3, and some of them have revenue commitments that will be used up before the contract is over. So it's very unusual to have this sort of a cluster. So that will put some pressure on growth here for the next couple of quarters, but then I expect that customer group to grow. They've been very busy buying up our security products, our compute product. I expect now they're great targets for the new acquisition we just picked up here. So I expect to expand the wallet share within those group of accounts. And this is just something that's pretty typical in the CDN business. And where we're seeing the pricing pressure is on the delivery side. We're not seeing it in the Security side, not seeing it at Edge. We're seeing it just in delivery. As far as the pandemic, we are starting to see a little bit of improvement in travel and hospitality. And as a reminder, that group was about 4% of our total revenue. I think that will sort of ebb and flow with how the pandemic goes. As we start to have these waves of new variants, travel slows down, as it goes away, travel picks up. Retail is still a bit sluggish, not really seeing a significant improvement. And just remember, we had set up a 0 overage, and the biggest acquirers of that type of contract are the retailers, especially in the U.S. So you see a little bit of a muted seasonality here in Q4 related to retail. But still some way to go here on retail. Travel is improving a bit. And in general, as we get past these renewals, you'll start to see the delivery business improve a bit. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Syneseal with Cowen. Michael Elias : This is Michael on for Colby. Two questions, if I may. First, following this acquisition, you also did Guardicore. How would you describe the appetite for additional M&A? And as part of that, how does this acquisition impact the way that you're thinking about additional buybacks? I thought there was a pretty notable step up in the fourth quarter. And then on one other question, if I can squeeze it in. With this acquisition, $100 million of revenue coming in and you talked about 15% growth that seems durable, how does this change the way you're thinking about the long-term revenue growth profile for the company? Tom Leighton : Yes. Good questions. Obviously, we've done 2 large deals, the largest deals we've done in about 20 years over the last several months. I wouldn't expect to see us continue at that rate, certainly. We probably will do more tech tuck-ins and smaller acquisitions. In terms of the buyback, our primary use of cash is for M&A and to buy back equity to offset the dilution from compensation programs. Now as I mentioned, that said, we do also opportunistically buy back additional stock. And if you look over the last 10 years, it's averaged a little more than 1% a year. And so I think our general approach to use of capital is not changing here.  Just we saw 2 exceptional opportunities, first with Guardicore and now with Linode. Guardicore really is a huge boost to our enterprise security business, Zero Trust capabilities. We believe they have the best solution to stop the impact of ransomware. And that's a huge, huge deal. And you see that in the improved guidance we've given. And just we closed the deal a few months ago, and we're looking at this year then of doing $30 million to $35 million and now, as you heard from Ed, substantially more than that. And I can tell you from talking to many of our customers, many of the world's major banks, they are very interested in what Guardicore can do, both the visibility it gives customers into their own networks and the ability to mitigate the impacts of ransomware. Now in terms of the durability of revenue growth from Linode, in the past, they were doing 15%. I think Ed and Adam talked about, we think we can do a lot more than that. Just consider that Linode doesn't really have a sales force, never mind a sales force like Akamai has going after major enterprises. And you combine that with the fact that our major enterprise customers have wanted us to have this capability for them. So we think we can really accelerate their growth and that it could well be that the 30% is sustainable. We're certainly going to try to do that. And if we're successful there, you can see Akamai as a whole back in double-digit revenue growth on a more sustainable basis, and that's certainly our goal. Operator : Next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : So curious, grew 22% -- actually, I'm sorry, 25% constant currency. But seem like new business slowed and the normalized security number was slightly down versus last quarter. So really, why aren't we growing faster in the segment when the market has come directly towards SASE, and it's been as healthy of a security market as we've probably seen since 2014. And have we seen a pickup at all in selling security outside of the existing CDN installed base? And just was squeezing in another one here, but what was the growth of our annual customer metrics you guys typically give in Q4 regarding the individual products and subsegments like in access control? Tom Leighton : I'll start with that and then hand it over to Ed. We're very pleased to see our security business grow 25% in constant currency. You talk about SASE, and that is a very small portion of our business today. In fact, SASE technically wouldn't even include micro-segmentation. I would imagine that's going to change in the near future because it's so important and it's going to become a requirement, I believe, for many of the world's major enterprises, certainly in the financial vertical. So the SASE framework is a small amount of Akamai revenue. And with Guardicore growing rapidly, the vast majority of our security revenue is the web security area, where we're protecting, think of it as B2C apps, from denial of service, from content corruption, from account theft, from data exfiltration, those kinds of attacks, which technically isn't part of the SASE framework. And so what you would think of is maybe more towards a SASE. We're getting very good growth on a small number. And of course the lion\u2019s share of our security business is in the web security, API protection, where we're the market leaders and growing at a very fast clip on a good size number for us. And Ed, maybe you want to take the rest of the question. Ed McGowan : Yes. So Jim, we don't break this out every quarter, but I'll just go back to the IR Day. We set targets for application security, network security and security services. And as a reminder, those goals were for application security, 20% to 25%, 20% to 25% in network security and then security services of 10% to 15%. I can tell you that we achieved all of those and exceeded, in many cases, those metrics. Are there any other metrics that you were looking for? I think you mentioned something about customers? James Fish : Yes. I mean we used to kind of talk about penetration of number of customers that are on your WAF solution at this point. And I thought at the Analyst Day, we were going to get the annual update on those subsegments. Maybe you're saving that for the Analyst Day. Ed McGowan : Yes. That's what we're going to do. On Analyst Day, we'll have a deep dive on that. What I'll do is I'll provide -- I provided this metric before in terms of the number of customers that buy a security product, that's up to 68.5%. So that's up about 6% year-over-year. 2 or more is up to 34.5%. That's up about 3%. 3 or more is up to 20%. And we increased our customer base by about 6% for the year. Our total customer base is up about 6%. Security penetration is up about 6% year-over-year. James Fish : Helpful. If I can squeeze in one more. One now, we've heard on some of the smaller developer-focused solutions like Linode is that organizations tend to kind of graduate from these solutions to an AWS or Azure. What investments are you looking to make or event this sort of graduation and make it more enterprise-grade for the Akamai installed base? Or is it more about taking Akamai downmarket and be that developer focus that we've been looking for? Tom Leighton : I'll hand this over to Adam in just a minute, but we're interested in the developer base for sure because our large enterprise customers, their apps are built and, in many cases, managed by the developers. So we really care about a developer-friendly solution. But we are going to take this to our large enterprise customers. And Adam has a robust road map of added capabilities. And Adam, why don't you talk a little bit about that? Adam Karon : Sure, Tom. I think Tom mentioned earlier, our -- some of our expertise is just building and deploying larger network presence all over the globe. So that would be our first area to go and make those locations that Linode has just more robust and available to our customers. But building in things like availability zones, BPC, identity access management and then building in compliance like SOC2 and PCI are really on the core parts of our road map so that customers can not only bring their apps onto the platform but graduate and continue to grow and scale globally as they build, run and secure the application right on the Akamai platform. Tom Leighton : And I just would add, our customers have been pretty explicit with us that they are very interested in us having this capability. And putting it together with the world's best content delivery capabilities, the world's best application performance and the world's best security solutions to provide an end-to-end solution. So I think you will not see this be a situation where they migrate from, say, a Linode to a Hyperscaler. But our customers are interested in alternatives and end-to-end solutions that -- maybe there are some functions on hyperscalers today that I think would migrate to Akamai's new cloud platform. We'll be the world's most distributed cloud platform with now market-leading solutions in not just delivery and security but also compute. Operator : Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Rishi Jaluria : Just 2. One on Linode and maybe an inverse of the last question. Obviously, they have a great traction of Akamai to cross-sell into that Linode base. You're obviously very, very strong in the larger enterprises with both security as well as the core delivery and Edge Applications business. Can you talk about your ability to actually take some of your more enterprise-grade products and actually sell them successfully downmarket once the Linode acquisition closes? And then I wanted to drill a little bit more into Q4 and what you saw from the e-commerce season. I know you talked a little bit about retail bounce-back being sluggish. But I know when we were on this call 3 months ago, one of the concerns was just with supply seeing concerns and the tough comps, e-commerce was going to be a little bit challenged in Q4. Just wanted to get a sense for what did you see specifically on the e-commerce side in Q4. Tom Leighton : I'll take the first question. Ed will take the second. Yes, we certainly can cross-sell into the Linode base. That's not our primary objective here. The primary objective is to take Linode and really scale that up and sell it into the large enterprise base. I think that's far more lucrative for us than taking our existing solutions and selling into the large number of small customers. And the focus will be moving Linode's capabilities into our platform and having a comprehensive solution for large enterprise customers. And Ed, you want to take the next one? Ed McGowan : Yes. I got it. So Rishi, on the commerce, you're right, when we had the Q3 call, we did talk about sort of a variety of commerce. I would say that we pretty much landed where we expected. We didn't really bake in a ton of upside really for 2 reasons. One was just uncertainty around supply chain, people potentially ordering earlier in the year. But the bigger factor was around the 0 overage. We've been in market now for over 2 years, and we've got a pretty high penetration so that you don't see as much of a bursting in Q4 as you do from the commerce customers. And as I've said, it's been a mixed bag. Some companies are doing pretty well, some aren\u2019t doing so great. So again, I'd say it's kind of as expected, but we weren't going in expecting a ton out of our retail vertical this Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citi. Fatima Boolani : Maybe a jump ball for you all just with respect to some of the new revenue classifications that we're going to be expecting in the next couple of months here. As I think back to your last Analyst Day, what was certainly helpful for us is to get a sense of what type of traffic mix you're expecting in the delivery franchise. So I'm curious with Linode in the family or soon to be, how you expect that mix of traffic to change relative to some of your expectations within the long and medium-term guide. And then I had a quick follow-up, if I could. Tom Leighton : Well, the traffic measured by bytes delivered is 95-plus percent big media and software downloads, gaming downloads. That's the vast majority of the traffic. That won't change with Linode. In fact, I would expect we'd be selling compute services to those same big media customers. In fact, several of them have expressed interest in that capability. So Linode won't change our traffic mix. And when we get together at IR Day, we'll do the deep dive in each of these categories to get a better feel of how the revenue is breaking down. Fatima Boolani : That's very helpful. And for Ed, I wanted to talk a little bit about the margin upside in the quarter. With the media business having some nice outperformance, we were still able to see a nice leverage fall through the model. So I'm just curious if you can walk us through some of the puts and takes within the cost-control elements of the business in the quarter. That would be helpful. Ed McGowan : Yes. Sure. Good question. So a couple of things to note on that. One is just a mix issue. So we obviously had a strong security quarter. I did a little bit better on security. So that drives very high incremental margins in the business. The other thing on the cost of goods sold line, the margins came in on the gross margin line a little bit better. Team has done a phenomenal job on driving down our bandwidth costs. As I look out towards next year, we expect traffic to grow sort of at normal rates. And my bandwidth costs are not really going up very much. So able to drive down bandwidth costs, that would be the big thing. We're getting good efficiencies, starting to see CapEx come down quite a bit. We won't see the depreciation fall off. You have to get a peak in, say, the next 1.5 years or so, then it will start to come off. But just around the -- around all the different organizations, which is doing -- really focused on efficiency. And we've seen good flow through when we get a little bit of a revenue upside. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham & Company. AlexHenderson: I was hoping we could talk a little bit about the architecture that you're anticipating as we go forward, whether you're planning on integrating the platforms at the Edge or whether you're -- as described in the slide deck, whether the Linode nodes are, in fact, relatively separate from your edge compute platform. Do you anticipate moving to a single software stack within each node? Or will these be separate nodes in that context? Tom Leighton : I'll start with that and then turn it over to Adam. You want to think of Akamai's platform is hierarchical. There's a core where functions such as storage would live, where there's dozens of locations for archive storage, migrating out all the way to the edge, where there's 4,000 PoPs, where most of our capabilities live today. Something else that's closer to the core in dozens of locations would be the Prolexic service. But things like delivering video, delivering software, accelerating your bank statement and most of all, the security other than Prolexic all live on the very edge out in 4,000 locations. EdgeWorkers lives out there too. EdgeKV lives out there. And Linode starts in the core in 11 locations, and we'll be expanding that quite a bit, and it will all be integrated together as part of one hierarchical platform. And then maybe, Adam, you could get a little bit deeper into that in terms of the software stack and so forth. Adam Karon : Yes. I think you covered most of it, but I think the way you can think about it is that the Linode stack itself can be segmented into multiple components. Just like Tom just described, you might have storage or databases that might exist closer to the core. And as you have more ephemeral-type instantiations of applications, you push those components further out towards our edge, ultimately culminating in our deep edge, where you'd have our Chrome V8 engines that can be instantiated on demand right on the edge itself. So that's our EdgeWorkers solution. But you can see kind of a Linode kind of stack like spanning the entire span and what Tom just described as the core all the way out to the edge. Alex Henderson : If I could follow up. You talked about the coder-centric capabilities of Linode. Can you talk about the degree to which coders are riding to this platform? And for that matter, to the Akamai platform, how many coders do you have right into your platform at this point? Tom Leighton : Adam, why don't you take that one? Adam Karon : Yes. On the Linode platform, they have over 150,000 customers today on their platform writing and deploying applications. On our -- was that the question? Alex Henderson : The degree to which the coders are writing to the platform, yes. I suppose they're not necessarily customers. I assume that customers have to do some writing. Adam Karon : The customers -- yes, they're primarily developers, which is 1 of the reasons for the benefit of bringing the developer-centric community that Linode brings to the Akamai community. And then those developers, as Tom described, a lot of them are the decision-makers inside of our enterprise customer base developing and deploying and, in some cases, managing those applications. And thus, that developer community becomes appealing -- appeals through those enterprise customers right back to Akamai. So it's kind of a great system that they have. Alex Henderson : Can you give us the Akamai-related data point relative to how many coders are writing to your edge compute capabilities? Adam Karon : I don't think I have that stat on hand right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. TimHoran: Will it take much investment to consolidate any of the great Linode both from a software and hardware perspective? And will you be operating on relatively similar hardware? And I guess same thing for the go-to-market strategy and I guess, customer care just a little bit about the overall investment. And then I just had a quick follow-up. Tom Leighton : Sure. So we are looking at the ways we can drive synergy between the hardware that the Linode platform runs on today and the Akamai platform. And you can imagine, we have a significant deep expertise in our network group and hardware engineering organizations that spend all of their time optimizing for that, which gives us our great COGS and Capex benefits inside of Akamai. So we'll look to do that as we integrate Linode. And then can you repeat the second half of the question? I think it was on go-to-market? Tim Horan : Yes. Just same thing for like customer care and go-to-market? Will you have to invest much to integrate? Adam Karon : Yes. No, the great thing about the platform is it is very self-service, very frictionless for developers to come on board. They have amazing documentation that make developers use of their platform easy. And they have a great customer care group inside of Linode that we've worked very closely with our -- and build up to the signing of this. And so we expect to have them operate more as a Tier 2 to our existing Akamai customer care organization. And of course, our existing enterprise sales force will be the sales force that goes to market, selling those products along with their existing self-service model they have today. Tim Horan : And you mentioned you have a very large network, obviously. Do you think you can get into the enterprise private line or global WAN market or just overall enterprise network indirectly? Adam Karon : Well, can you ask -- I think in terms of enterprise win or whatnot, we do partner very closely with our telco partners, and that's something that we work very closely with them when they have opportunities. We use our network in combination with theirs, where it makes synergy with those customers that want to use both our telco partners and Akamai. I'm not sure if that's what you were getting at or something that -- Tom Leighton : Think of Akamai as providing Internet connectivity to enterprises. That's not our business. We -- that's our partners' business. Now we do provide clean access so that an enterprise can sort of hide behind Akamai. And only Akamai can come through so that they maintain safety and security for their data centers. So we do that, but we're not -- we don't provide base connectivity. That would be our partners, which would be the carriers. Operator : Our next question comes from Franklin Louthan with Raymond James. Franklin Louthan : You mentioned earlier bringing scale to the business here. And I'm just curious what the strategy is for bringing scale to compete increasingly with large cloud companies that have some of the biggest scale in the world. And why the strategic decision to move in that direction and not bolster more of the security or the core CDN business? Tom Leighton : Yes. When you think of scale, there's a it. One is just how many servers do you have. Obviously, we have a lot. But the way we think about scale is more in terms of being distributed. And none of the hyperscalers come anywhere close to us in terms of being in 4,000 PoPs and having a real edge network. Now what we haven't had before is the managed VM, managed container services. And our customers have asked for that. That's been the one missing piece on our platform. Because customers for many of their apps would like to take the entire app, build it on Akamai, run it on Akamai, deliver it through us, where they know they get fabulous performance, instant scalability, where it becomes relevant to do so to have the edge computing really done on the edge and then to have it all be secure so that we can provide the end-to-end service. And so that's why we're doing this. And in some cases, there may be some -- of course, we've been competing with the hyperscalers for 15 years, and I think that will continue. And I think the hyperscalers themselves, several of them are our largest customers. And several of them are already using us for our compute capabilities, and I expect that to increase with the acquisition of Linode. And so it's an environment where we compete, of course, have and for many years and successfully. And what we do, we do really well. And that will be taking an application, making it easy to build and deploy on Akamai and then to have the world's best performance, scalability, global reach and security. And that's where Akamai excels. And that's the goal in making this acquisition is really to complete that story to be able to have the end-to-end capability to handle their applications. Adam Karon : Yes. And just to add, I think that -- I was going to -- this doesn't take away from our investment in security. And another way to think about it is you've now got 2 very exciting, fast-growing businesses inside of Akamai, led by 2 different leaders in the company. And the scale that we can bring -- turn the question around and think about if you're a $100-plus million company trying to scale to $1 billion, what would you need? You'd need an enterprise sales force. You'd need a global private network. You'd want to have a low-cost deployment model. You'd want to have access to customers and channel, and we bring all that. So this, to me, was a very natural adjacency for us. And I look at ourselves and what we're spending in third-party cloud, looking at bringing that in-house driving some additional synergies and savings there, it's just a natural extension of what we're doing and entering a really, really big, exciting market. And again, it doesn't take away from our ability to invest in security. As you saw, we did 2 very large acquisitions : one in security, one here in cloud. And we're very fortunate with our profitability and our cash flow generation to be able to do that. Franklin Louthan : So is the end goal to be able to provide some of these cloud computing functions on yourself that would -- that the large cloud companies would white label? Or are you going to be providing aspects that they just can't do themselves in their larger server farm requirements? Tom Leighton : I think both. There's things that we do today at a level that the hyperscalers don't do. I mean they have competing services, but in many cases, the hyperscalers use us and use our services for their own properties even though we compete with them. I do expect us to be partnering with, well, certainly many of the world's major carriers and white labeling our services. Of course, the carriers are major channel partners with us today, and I think that will increase through the acquisition of Linode because they've had an interest in being able to offer that kind of capability, and now it comes hand-in-hand with, well, the whole solution all put together. Operator : Our next question comes from Rudy Kessinger with D.A. Davidson. Rudy Kessinger : I want to go -- 2 things here. Starting off, going back to the customers that are going to have the repricing. You said basically declined in first half and then returned to growth in the second half. For the year in '22 over '21, what's your expectation for that group? Are they going to be slightly down or about breakeven on a growth basis? Ed McGowan : Yes. Good question. So I would expect those customers to be slightly up year-over-year. So as you decline in the first 2 quarters, you start growing the back half. Now there's also significant upside with the Linode products as well. You can imagine these guys have -- they spend tons of money in this area. So there's a potential there that you could continue to grow that base of customers. So not expecting that this year, but it's possible that we could start to tap into that. Obviously, we're going to have to build a pipeline, get customers lined up, but that's obviously, certainly a very target-rich group of customers. Rudy Kessinger : Got it. And then secondly, going back to Guardicore, a pretty substantial outperformance thus far. I think you said $10 million in the quarter. Initial expectation in Q4 was 6 to 7 and then obviously, 50 to 55 expected versus 30 to 35 originally. Just what's really driving that upside? What's really resonating well with this product, both with new customers and those that you're cross-selling? Tom Leighton : Well, obviously, ransomware is a big problem. And we believe that Guardicore has the best solution. It is easier to use than competing solutions, and micro-segmentation has a reputation for being really hard to implement and inflexible. It gives you great visibility in terms of what's going on in your network. Customers have really appreciated that. It's really important with security. And they have a solution that works with legacy systems that the competition doesn't have. They have built their own custom firewall. And the competing services will have to rely on the existing firewalls and whatever operating systems being used by a particular application and, in some cases, doesn't even exist and so they can't cover it. So it's the best solution and to a big problem that's rapidly growing. And so we've seen very strong interest in our customer base. And of course, we have a very large enterprise sales force that now can bring Guardicore into the large banks and the large enterprises, and the initial reception has been very strong. So yes, I'm very excited by their performance this year, and I'm looking forward to substantial growth in the future. Operator : This question comes from Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. JeffVan Rhee : So 2 quick ones for me. First, I guess, on the cross-sell back into your base of Linode product. How critical is it to win over the developers in your base? I mean, obviously, you've got the relationship. Maybe you can come in and try to make the cross-sell, but there's a lot of power sitting in those developers. What is it about these tools that the developers will see as their best option? And how do you win them over? Tom Leighton : Adam, why don't you take that one? Adam Karon : of the most attractive things to the Linode platform is that their developer-centric tools make it really easy for customers who use their Kubernetes engine, use their managed VMs. It's just very simple to configure. Onboard comes with a ton of documentation, makes it very simple for somebody to learn how to use, and Onboard themselves and try their applications very quickly on their platform. We heard from developers inside of our own company as well as developers inside of our customers that they love to use the Linode tools, they're simple, easy. And that's really why we think we're going to win over the developers using that type of platform, something that's simple, easy to use and has great documentation. Jeff Van Rhee : Yes. And you may have missed it -- mentioned it. If I missed it, apologies, but in terms of the customer base, how many customers, what's an average spend per year for the Linode base? And any particular concentrations in the base from vertical or other segmentation that matters? Adam Karon : So the Linode customer base is around 150,000 customers. We don't break them down like that, at least not yet. But we can tell you, I think Ed mentioned this earlier on the call, that the larger segment of their customer base is growing much faster than the very, very small developers. But we don't give out the ARPU yet on the customer base. Ed McGowan : Yes. Just to add, there's no customer concentration risk in terms of any significant customers making up a large percentage of the revenue. And earlier, it was Adam who mentioned that from a go-to-market perspective, they didn't focus on selling into large enterprises. That's where we can bring in that synergy. So I would expect that over time, that customer base could change and look a lot more like our customer base. And obviously, that small developer base will just continue to grow as we continue to market and that sort of thing. But it also opens up opportunities in some of our underserved verticals that you think about the spend in certain places that may not have as large websites or web presence, but they're spending an awful lot in this area. So I do expect that customer base to change. When we get to Analyst Day, we'll try to break that down a little bit for you, give you some views in terms of how we're thinking about growth in the future. And then as we get some months under our belt of operating the company, as we come up with new metrics that we think are helpful, we'll obviously bring them to the table and disclose them for you. Tom Barth : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at several investor conferences and road shows throughout the rest of the first quarter. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Thank you for joining us, and all of us here at Akamai wish you continued good health, and we wish you a happy evening. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tom Barth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's first quarter 2022 earnings call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. These factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent company's view on May 3, 2022. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances except as required by law. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section at akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom. And thank you all for joining us today. Our Q1 revenue was $904 million, up 7% year-over-year and up 9% in constant currency. This solid result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our Security and Compute businesses. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was a $1.39 per diluted share, up 1% year-over-year and up 4% in constant currency. As Ed will discuss later, EPS came in at the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to an adverse tax impact of $0.03. Since our last call with you on February 15, we've seen the development of several major global events and financial headwinds. It\u2019s remarkable how quickly the world has changed with the war in Ukraine, the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar, escalating inflation, increasing concerns about a recession and a moderation of internet traffic growth, as many countries remove mask mandates. Since these developments are all fairly recent, they had a relatively small impact on our Q1 results, but it's prudent to assume that they'll impact our results more meaningfully for the rest of the year. For example, at current spot rates, the strengthening dollar will adversely impact full year 2022 revenue by about a $100 million. About $55 million of that impact has come since we issued guidance on February 15. As we disclosed in our 8-K filing on March 7, about 1% of our revenue comes from Russian companies or is derived from delivering traffic into Russia. We have since terminated our business with several majority state-owned Russian companies and our traffic delivered into Russia and Ukraine on behalf of other global customers has declined dramatically since the war began. As a result, it's reasonable to assume that we will no longer generate most of the revenue that had been associated with Russian and Ukraine. Lastly, data from some of our large customers in the media and commerce verticals suggest that they may be transitioning from an environment of above normal online consumption, fueled by COVID-related restrictions to an environment with more macroeconomic uncertainty, which could moderate their traffic growth in the near term. Discussions with many of our large carrier partners across the world have reinforced the view that traffic growth rates may be moderating across the internet as a whole. In particular, they've told us that they've recently seen a moderation in their year-over-year traffic growth, and that the current levels of traffic on their network are less than what they'd expected. This is consistent with what we've recently seen. Traffic is still growing at a fast pace on the Akamai platform, but at a more moderate pace than we've observed over the last few years. As a result of these largely external factors and to be conservative in our outlook, we feel it\u2019s prudent to lower our expectations for the full year. Ed will provide more detail shortly. That said, and this is important to emphasize, Akamai\u2019s business continues to be very strong and highly profitable. Traffic growth on our platform remains substantial. And the data we've received from customers and carrier partners indicates that our market share remains stable or is modestly increasing. In addition, our customer churn levels continue to be at record lows. Lost annual revenue from churned accounts in Q1 amounted to less than one half of 1% of total annual revenue. And churn due to competitors was much less than half of that already small amount. As a result, our market leading delivery business continues to generate substantial cash and to power our unique edge platform. Our security business has reached an annual revenue run rate of over $1 billion and continues to grow over 20% annually in constant currency. And we believe that our Compute business is poised to achieve about $400 million in revenue this year with a growth rate of over 60%. And perhaps most important of all the combination of our security and compute businesses now represents the majority of our revenue. We expect these businesses to generate about $2 billion of revenue this year with a growth rate of about 27% in constant currency. I'll now talk about each of our three major business lines, starting with Security, which we believe will soon become our largest business line. Our security solutions generated revenue of $382 million in Q1, one up 23% year-over-year and up 26% in constant currency. This very strong growth was driven primarily by our flagship security products, Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager. And also by our new Guardicore micro-segmentation solution to stop ransomware. In Q1, we finalized the largest deal in Guardicore\u2019s history, valued it more than $10 million over the next three years, expanding our longtime relationship with one of the largest banks in the world. The size and scope of the deal illustrates why we're so excited about our opportunity in micro segmentation. Financial services firms in particular are frequent targets of ransomware and malware and large banks with security risks, face financial penalties from regulators if they fail to address them. So from a compliance perspective, adopting micro segmentation can reduce risk and prevent large fines in the process. By reducing spending on their legacy static firewalls, the bank that's adopting our micro segmentation solution will free up resources to implement stronger defenses as they move to a new zero trust security architecture. And by converting to our more flexible software-based solution, they can achieve greater agility to compete with fast moving FinTech services. This example demonstrates how Guardicore can help Akamai expand longtime relationships with customers to become a more valuable strategic partner in the future. Guardicore is also helping us win new accounts and verticals such as critical infrastructure. For example, one of the largest railroads in the world recently became a multimillion dollar Guardicore customer. On April 20, cybersecurity authorities in the U.S. and other major countries warned that the war in Ukraine raises the risk of cyber attacks. Their recommended defenses aligned well to Akamai security solutions from microsegmentation, DDoS protection and web app firewall. Web application attacks experienced by customers grew by nearly 200% year-over-year in Q1. The largest increase we've seen in several years, web app attacks are a critical vulnerability for any company moving to the cloud, building microservices or integrating third parties via APIs, which is why app and API protection is a critical priority for major enterprises. Akamai is a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Web App and API Protection. And in Q1, Akamai\u2019s web app and API protection on Gartner Peer Insights Customers Choice Distinction for the third year in a row, also in Q1, Forrester named Akamai a leader in its New Wave for Microsegmentation. As we discussed during our last call with investors in February, we will be reporting on our delivery and compute product lines separately, going forward. In Q1, our delivery products generated revenue of $444 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% in constant currency. Revenue for our compute product group was $78 million in Q1, up 32% year-over-year and up 35% in constant currency. As I mentioned earlier, traffic on our platform has been growing at a substantial rate. In fact, just last week, we set another record when we delivered over 250 terabits per second of peak traffic, more than 20% higher than our previous peak reached in February. The Akamai Edge platform continues to be the top choice for large media companies worldwide due to its unique scale and performance. In a recent review of CDN vendors worldwide, IDC said Akamai's balanced and comprehensive portfolio spanning media and web delivery, emerging edge applications, extensive security capabilities, and programmable edge addresses the needs of all enterprise segments and the developer community. The report also noted how Akamai's appetite for innovation is showcased by the fact that it continues to expand its services and capabilities beyond CDN to address new areas. Akamai is the market leader in delivery by far, and the income generated by our delivery business helps to fund our investments in the fast growing areas of security and compute, including our game changing acquisitions of Guardicore and Linode. Our compute product group includes Akamai\u2019s capabilities in compute, storage, cloud optimization, developer tools, edge applications, and now Linode, which joined Akamai on March 21. We are encouraged by how customers and industry analysts have responded to our acquisition of Linode. In fact, several of used the word transformational to sum up the potential impact of our combination of the marketplace, the CEO and Co-Founder of Macrometa, Linode partner that enables web and cloud developers to run and scale data heavy real-time cloud applications has called Akamai\u2019s acquisition of Linode, a watershed moment for the cloud because it fundamentally reconfigures the landscape in many ways. Those are his words and he says that Akamai provides that layer of reach and distribution in a way that cloud providers are very challenged to be able to do. I'm excited about that he said. Of course, we're excited too. Linode was an early pioneer in creating the market for alternative clouds, offering developers a platform to build new applications in ways that are simple to use and affordable. With high performance, a competitive, transparent, and predictable price points and backed by strong customer support after the sale. Today, nearly three quarters of enterprises are pursuing multi-cloud strategies, which means that new workloads will be cloud agnostic and portable, free to move and choose the best place to be. In fact, IDC just issued a report on workload deployment optimization that urges buyers to consider suppliers of Infrastructure-as-a-Service beyond the hyperscalers. Our acquisition of Linode was the first alternative IDC highlighted as an example that can offer better cost and performance while retaining the level of redundancy and coverage demanded by enterprises. In the coming years, we expect that customers will have a growing need for a continuum of compute from the cloud to the edge, to be closer where billions of end users are and where tens of billions of connected devices will be, especially as 5G and IoT take hold and grow. Building the bridge that enables developers to move from the cloud to the edge and have one place to build, run and secure apps is a key reason why we're expanding our offering with Linode. At our Analyst Day, coming up on May 18, we'll talk more about the potential for substantial future growth in this new and exciting part of Akamai's portfolio. As we become the cloud company that powers and protects life online. The soundness of our overall strategy was validated in visits I had with dozens of Akamai customers across EMEA and APJ last month. Common concerns expressed by customers and prospects included the war in Ukraine, the heightened level of cyber attacks, as well as risk to trade and supply chains, energy costs, and currency evaluations. Customers express very strong interest in our security strategy and Guardicore, in particular. As you can imagine, their boards are asking them how they can prevent a crippling ransomware attack. And Guardicore is the perfect solution. They know that malware always finds a way in, the key is identifying it and stopping it spread before it can cause serious damage. And that's exactly what Guardicore is designed to do. Most of the customers I met with, were also interested in exploring our cloud compute offering as a more affordable and easier way to build, run, and secure their new applications. The tight labor market, employee attrition, and the desire of employees to work remotely were also top of mind for customers in every location. Several companies that I met with are reducing their real estate footprint. And one of them told me they could only do this because they secured their remote work environments with Akamai's enterprise application access. Here at Akamai, we face the same macro trends as our customers, but in spite of the headwinds, we feel good about the growing demand from customers for our security and compute solutions, the expertise of our team in the addition of capabilities and talent from Guardicore and Linode. And how all of this gives Akamai not one, but two, rapidly growing and highly synergistic businesses, further diversifying our revenue, we've also performed well on the retention of our talent, employees appreciate our flexible workplace policy and culture of teamwork. Akamai scores very high on third-party rankings of the Best Places to Work. I'm proud of the way that our employees have managed. And I want to thank our extended team around the world for doing such a great job for our customers. They are truly making life better for billions of people, billions of times a day. Now over to Ed for more on Q1 and our outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. As Tom mentioned, Akamai delivered a solid quarter in Q1. Q1 revenue is $904 million, up 7% year-over-year, or 9% in constant current currency. Revenue was led by continued strong growth in security and compute. The strength was partially offset by a significant strengthening U.S. dollar and a slight moderation in traffic growth rate in our delivery business during the last month of the quarter. Security revenue grew 23% year-over-year and 26% in constant currency, led by a reacceleration of growth in our application Security business and continued very strong performance from Guardicore. Security represented 42% of total revenue in Q1, which is up 5 points from Q1 a year ago. Guardicore delivered revenue of $19 million in the quarter, included in our Guardicore results was approximately $7 million of term license deals from four customers. As a reminder, while the majority of Guardicore deals are Software as a Service and revenue is recognized monthly under ASC 606, some customers specifically financial services and healthcare due from time to time require on-premise deployments. These deployments result in term license accounting treatment, where we are required to recognize a significant portion of the revenue upfront when the product is delivered for spreading the revenue over the contract term. It\u2019s worth noting the impact of these deals resulted in a pull forward from Q2 to Q4 into Q1 of approximately 1 percentage point of revenue growth. Compute revenue in Q1 was $78 million and grew 32% year-over-year and 35% in constant currency. As Tom mentioned, we were very pleased with the initial performance of our Linode acquisition, which closed in late March and contributed revenue of approximately $3.5 million in Q1. Delivery revenue was $444 million in Q1 and decline 6% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency. As discussed last quarter, several of our top customers are expected to renew in the first half of 2022. Our first quarter revenue was impacted by the renewals of half of these customers, we expect the remaining customers to renew by July 1. So far, the pricing for the renewals has been in line with our expectations. Additionally, we started to notice the growth rate of traffic on our network moderate a bit in March, specifically in gaming and OTT verticals. As some pandemic related restrictions were lifted in countries throughout the world. Sales in our international markets represented 47% of total revenue in Q1. International revenue grew 11% year-over-year or 16% in constant currency. The negative impact of foreign exchange on our Q1 results increased by approximately $2 million from our February earnings call as a U.S. dollar continued to strengthened significantly in March. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a sequential basis and negative $18 million on a year-over-year basis. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $481 million and grew 4% year-over-year. Now moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 76% in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 63%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $295 million. Now moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $391 million. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 43% in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income was $270 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $116 million. This was slightly better than our guidance range as we continued to see greater efficiency on our network. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $119 million or $0.73 of earning per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $225 million or $1.39 of earnings per diluted share, up 1% year-over-year and up 4% in constant currency. Non-GAAP earnings per share was negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 in Q1 due to a higher than expected non-GAAP effective tax rate. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $43 million based on a Q1 effective tax rate of approximately 16%. This was approximately 1.5 points higher than we had expected in due primarily to three reasons. First, a higher than expected mix of U.S. revenue with foreign exchange rate fluctuations, a significant contributing factor along with the addition of Linode revenue. Second, an unfavorable change to foreign tax credits in Q1 based on the most recent treasury guidance. And third, a refinement of our previous assumptions related to R&D tax launching changes from the 2017 U.S. tax reform that became effective in Q1 2022. Moving now to cash in our use of capital. As of March our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.3 billion. During the first quarter, we spent approximately $103 million repurchase shares, buying back approximately 900,000 shares. In addition to share repurchases in March, we spent approximately $900 million to complete our acquisition of Linode. We ended Q1 with approximately $1.7 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Our intention is to continue to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time, and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases. Before I provide our Q2 and 2022 guidance, I want to highlight several factors. First, our guidance now includes Linode. We expect Linode to contribute revenue of approximately $100 million and add approximately $0.05 to $0.06 to non-GAAP EPS in 2022. This is unchanged from the assumptions we shared on our last call. Second, the dollar has continued to strengthen meaningfully since we reported in mid-February. As a result, we currently expect a much greater foreign exchange headwind for the remainder of 2022. At current spot rates, our guidance assumes that foreign exchange will have a negative $100 million impact on revenue on a year-over-year basis. This compares to our prior guidance of a negative $45 million impact to revenue. This change in FX from our prior guide will also negatively impact non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.16 for the a full year 2022. It\u2019s worth emphasizing that currency markets have been extremely unsettled and about as volatile as I have ever seen, as a result, it is impossible to predict whether and how the impact could change going forward. Third, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2022 to be approximately 16%, which is a approximately 1.5 points higher than our prior assumption. Based on the items I mentioned before, the change in tax rate will also negatively impact the full year 2022 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.11. Fourth, as Tom discussed, regarding our business in Russia and Ukraine is reasonable to assume that most of that revenue goes away. Finally, as mentioned earlier, our traffic growth rate moderated a bit in March, and we\u2019ve seen that trend continue in April. While traffic continues to grow at a strong rate and as at record levels, the growth rate is lower than we originally expected. Therefore, we are taking a more conservative approach to forecasting our traffic and corresponding revenue for the remainder of the year. That said, we do not believe this trend is a permanent consumer shift or due to us losing share, but rather is likely driven by some of the significant external factors we are seeing in the marketplace and geopolitically. Said another way, we believe that traffic growth and online activity return to more historical norms at some point. So with all those factors in mind, turning to our Q2 guidance. We are now projecting revenue in the range of $890 million to $905 million or up 4% to 6% as reported or 8% to 10% in constant currency over Q2 2021. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $14 million impact on Q2 revenue compared to Q1 levels and a negative $30 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 75%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $282 million to $289 million. We anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of approximately 43%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $129 million to $130 million. And we expect non-GAAP operating margin to decline to approximately 29% for Q2 to largely to the change in FX and some node integration costs. Moving now to CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $150 million to $155 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the second quarter. This represents approximately 17% of projected total revenue. A significant portion of the increase in the spend this quarter is related to Linode, an anticipation of significant demand. With the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS from the range of $1.28 to $1.33. This EPS guidance assumes taxes, the $40 million to $41 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 16%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 162 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we now expect revenue of $3.62 billion to $3.67 billion, which is up 5% to 6% year-over-year as reported, we\u2019re up 7% to 9% in constant currency. We expect security revenue to grow at least 20% or greater for full year 2022 in constant currency. We now estimate non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 29% based primarily on the impact of FX and some of the internet traffic dynamics I previously discussed. We now estimate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.32 to $5.44. This non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 16%, a fully diluted share count of approximately 161 million shares. Finally, full year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 14% of revenue. It is worth noting, our CapEx assumption now includes Linode that we talked about on our last quarter, partially offset by lower network CapEx, given the slower traffic growth rate that we now project. In closing, while the macroeconomic environment has become more challenging since our last earnings call and the U.S. dollar continues to be a major headwind for us. We remain very optimistic about the opportunities in front of us, especially in Security and Compute. As Tom mentioned, I look forward to seeing you at our Analyst Day in New York City on May 18. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the call and a lot of great kind of information in there for us to kind of better understand kind of what\u2019s going on with a lot of moving pieces in the environment. Of course, I\u2019m going to ask you about more on that. So in particular, when you see like the slowing network traffic and some of these increasing pressures, is there any kind of geographic specificity to it? Is it more in Europe than the U.S. or is it more evenly spread number one. And number two, on the security side of the equation, is there any counterforce if you will, meaning, it sounds like, it\u2019s a pretty bad threat environment out there. You guys have a great solution portfolio for those types of threats. Are you seeing any sort of increasing demand on that side of the equation that can offset some of those potential headwinds on the delivering compute side of the equation? Thank you. Tom Leighton : Yes, this is Tom. Great questions. The traffic, I would say, growth moderation seems to be pretty much global and that coincides with a pretty much global reduction in things like mask mandates and quarantines and so forth, except for China. And we don\u2019t do domestic to domestic delivery in China, so we wouldn\u2019t be able to see that. So there\u2019s no particular geographic dependence there and you\u2019re on a great point about counterbalance through security. Obviously, we\u2019re negatively impacted in terms of traffic and a few customers, because of the war and Ukraine. On the other hand, attacks have gone way up, the volume of attacks. And that\u2019s an area where we can really help our customers. And so there could have some counterbalance in terms of the security business. And obviously, as I mentioned, customers are really worried about ransomware attacks and malware, and we\u2019ve got a great solution for that with Guardicore. And as we talk about the macroeconomic challenges, the fears of a recession, the inflation \u2013 customers probably increasingly concerned about saving cost going forward and that could provide some counterbalance as well, with our Linode solution, we\u2019re in a really good position to help major enterprises decrease their cloud spend. We find that many of them have seen that spend increase dramatically. And now they can use Linode for applications, especially, enterprises that are already set up in a multi-cloud environment. They\u2019ve got their applications and containers or VMs, and they could easily move those to Linode and save money. So there could be some counterbalance here as we go forward. That\u2019s a very good observation. Keith Weiss : Got it. And if I could sneak one in for Ed on the other side of the equation. You talked to us about how sort of CapEx is coming down a little bit versus kind of what we were talking about immediately after Linode based on lower network traffic. Are there any adjustments that you guys are making to your OpEx side of the equation? So the level of investment that you guys are going to be making throughout the year given a more kind of difficult environment. Or is it \u2013 it\u2019s kind of steady investment as you goes, if you will. Tom Leighton : We\u2019re not able to hear, Ed. So I guess, we\u2019re having a trouble with the operator with Ed maybe \u2013 okay. Could you ask the question again, please? Keith Weiss : Sure. Thanks. So I was just on the call, Ed, you had talked about CapEx coming down a little bit because of sort of lower network traffic. I was just wondering if you guys are making any adjustment to the OpEx for FY2022 given the more volatile macro. Any limitation in any kind of your investments throughout the year, or do the investments stay relatively stable? Tom Leighton : No, that\u2019s a great question. And yes, CapEx is much more efficient. Of course, we\u2019re investing heavily to grow the Linode footprint. In terms of OpEx, we\u2019re always working to be more efficient with our OpEx to deliver traffic. And we\u2019re seeing the benefits of that even now. You look at the impact that FX for example is having on our operating margin and then, having less traffic and yet still we were at 29% to 30% with op margin for this year. And now we\u2019ll be, I think really closer to the low end of that range. But it\u2019s because that we\u2019ve been able to be much more efficient on OpEx that we can hold it there and not be lower than that. And of course, we are \u2013 also it\u2019s important that we are going to continue to invest certainly in security and compute. We don\u2019t want to be a very temporary solution with FX to induce us to do something that would hurt us long-term with our growth and security and compute. And if you look at our business today and I think it\u2019s pretty important to note that the majority of our revenue is now security and compute, and that is growing currently at over 25% as reported. And so the last thing we want to do is somehow scale back investment there when it\u2019s just a fabulous a couple of businesses just because there\u2019s stuff going on with FX and the macroeconomic environment. And Ed is trying to get back on, but we can keep going and I\u2019ll do my best Ed invitation in the meantime. Ed McGowan : Yeah. So Tom, I\u2019m back, could you guys hear me now? Tom Leighton : We can, very good. Ed McGowan : Okay, great. I\u2019m sorry about that. I don\u2019t know what happened little technical difficulties there, Keith. But I\u2019m not sure if Tom got to your question about some of the things we\u2019re doing on the cost. Okay, if there\u2019s anything else I\u2019m happy to take an additional question. Keith Weiss : Yes. No, Tom did a great job. You might have to worry about job security now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Breen with William Blair. Your line is open. James Breen : Thanks. Just a couple. One, when you look at the old guidance that you gave on the fourth quarter call relative today down kind of $5 million at the \u2013 $50 million below and in the high end. Given some of the puts and takes you gave, it seems like the rush impact sort of mid $30 million, and then the incremental FX of sort of in the mid 50s sort of kind of offsets basically the upside from Linode and close that deal. I\u2019m just trying to think about to quantify it. So is that sort of incremental kind of $15 million difference, really what you\u2019re seeing from the lower traffic on the delivery side. And can you just remind us of the delivery revenue this quarter the $444 million? How we want to think about it annually? How much of that is more volume driven versus subscription based? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Yes. Jim, it Ed. Yes, I think you\u2019ve got the pieces right there in terms of the different components, FX being about $55 million, Russia, you could say is about 1%, so call at about $30 million give or take. But the rest of it is the delivery. I think one of the things we tried to make clear in our prepared remarks was the Compute business is going great. We don\u2019t have any \u2013 we\u2019ve only owned the business for a little while, so there\u2019s no change there in terms of our outlook. But certainly good early returns and then security is going great, did better than we expected this quarter. So it is limited to a delivery issue and is, I would say primarily, almost all volume driven that we\u2019re seeing. So what we did basically is just adjust the growth rate that we expected for the remainder of the year. And then obviously, things can change over time. But based on what we\u2019ve seen so far in the last couple weeks of March and the beginning of April, we just thought it was prudent to adjust that. So you\u2019re thinking about it right in terms of the different pieces. James Breen : Great. And then just maybe one for Tom, just the strategy. Linode, you\u2019ve owned it now for a little over a month. They were folks a lot on sort of the small midsize business space in terms of the computing storage. Have you seen any traction with that product that some of your larger customers now that it\u2019s starting to get integrated? Tom Leighton : Yes, obviously very early days, but we\u2019re really excited about the potential for that traction. I give you just, one anecdote, I was in Europe meeting customers last month and met with one of our major media workflow partners. And I was going to go to talk to them about Linode because they have a big cloud spend and we feel that could be really relevant for moving to Linode. They\u2019re very happy Akamai partners and customers. And I was going to tell them about the acquisition, but I get there, we shake hands. First thing he says is, wow, great acquisition. And he\u2019s is the CEO, but turns out he has a pass as a developer knew about Linode, loves them and he\u2019s into multi-cloud and he said, look, what we did is we already have our workflow apps and containers. And so we thought, what the heck let\u2019s try it. And so they moved him over to Linode and he said, it worked great. And he said, we\u2019re going to save money to boot. And it\u2019s really easy to use. And we didn\u2019t even know because Linode really is easy to use that we didn\u2019t know this was even taking place. So I do think we\u2019re in an excellent position to not only increase the existing Linode customer base, but provide Linode capabilities to major enterprises. And of course, Linode really appeals the developers and increasingly developers are making the decisions or heavily influencing the decisions that have major enterprises as was an example in this case. James Breen : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Your line is open. Rishi Jaluria : Wonderful guys. Thanks for taking my questions and appreciate all the details around the moving pieces. First, I wanted to start with maybe better understanding some of the macro factors. I think look, the FX well understood, Russia as well, the moderating traffic with reopenings. But Tom, at the beginning you had mentioned kind of the inflation side, as well as fears of recession being in Western Europe or globally. Can you talk a little bit more about how those macro factors are impacting your business? Is this resulting in longer sales cycles, smaller initial deals, just more hesitation around new deals? Any color there that you can give would be helpful and then have a follow-up. Ed McGowan : Yes. This is Ed. I\u2019ll take that and Tom, if you want to add some color if I missed something here. So, in terms of the inflation and the impact on our business today, we\u2019re not seeing a significant impact from inflation, whether that\u2019s with labor costs or with our costs of our network and that sort of thing. We\u2019re seeing a little bit of higher energy prices in Europe and that sort of thing. But our team does a pretty good job of trying to bake that into their deals when they sign colo deals and that sort of thing. That could obviously change, obviously the labor markets are pretty tight and that sort of thing. But I think the biggest macro impact from our business in terms of our change in outlook is really around the change in behavior where we\u2019re seeing mask mandates lifted and people going out more shopping, more in-stores and that sort of stuff. And the impact on the traffic growth rate is probably the biggest impact. Obviously if we get a major recession that could potentially have a greater impact, but we\u2019re not seeing that certainly in the security business, we\u2019re not seeing customers pulling back. We\u2019re not seeing deals size, the deals getting elongated or anything along those lines. It\u2019s really more that, that impact on the traffic business. Tom Leighton : Yes. And to Ed\u2019s point, it\u2019s not direct on us, but there is some concern among our media customers in terms of subscriptions and how their business is doing. And so we just keeping an eye on that in terms of the end users reacting in cutting cost and consuming less online. So, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a major factor yet, but it\u2019s something we\u2019re keeping an eye on. Rishi Jaluria : Got it. That that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. And then just going back to Linode, I guess number one, if we do the math back of the envelope, it\u2019s about a $4 million contribution in Q1 is that directionally a correct, number one. And I think number two, when you made the acquisition; you talked about incremental investment opportunities to accelerate the growth rate. Can you maybe remind us about where you find those opportunities, especially where there\u2019s low hanging fruit? And what would be an ideal growth rate for the Linode asset? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Yes. So, I\u2019ll start off with the question first, just the housekeeping item. We had about $3.5 million of revenue we see in the quarter from Linode. And then as far as the growth rate\u2019s concerned, we\u2019ll get into a lot more details when we see you in New York in a couple of weeks, but, obviously this is a very, very fast growing business, and Linode\u2019s growth rate before we acquire them was at 15%. We think we can accelerate that pretty significantly as we introduce more features, more locations, more capabilities, and we start to tap into our enterprise customer base. So, we think that growth rate can accelerate pretty significantly. Tom Leighton : Yes. Just to add to that in terms of investment and opportunities, obviously scale is something we\u2019re really good at and distribution, which we\u2019re putting a lot of effort into, and our customer base, which Linode really hadn\u2019t tapped into and being a smaller company, probably a little harder for them to go after major enterprises in terms of the credibility and so forth. But that\u2019s really easy for us to do. And just as I talked about with examples before you take Linode ease of use, and our customer base and those customers that are multi-cloud, and have their apps and containers, they can move them over and save money when they do it. And bring it closer to their delivery and security, which has been occupy where the market leaders at. So, I think there\u2019s a really great opportunity to jumpstart a significant growth among major enterprises for Linode. Rishi Jaluria : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you so much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Tim Horan : Thank you. Tom, on that point with apps and containers is it, have we seen many apps kind of poured over to other clouds at this point, and if they are tying into other value-added products and other software products that the cloud guys have, does it make it harder to do? Or can they still do it relatively easily? Tom Leighton : Yes, that\u2019s another great point. The hyperscalers have a lot of managed services and added functionality on their platform, which Linode doesn\u2019t. Now, if you\u2019re the kind of company that likes to do those things yourself well, that\u2019s easy to do on Linode. If you\u2019re the kind of company that wants that done by your cloud provider, well, Linode doesn\u2019t do that today. Now, over time, we will be adding more and more capabilities there. So it really, so today I wouldn\u2019t say that that every customer would be in a position to move everything over to Linode. That is certainly not the case. But I think there is a pretty significant segment where it can be done and does make sense to do. And over time we want to grow the kinds of the number, in the types of applications that will make sense to move on to Linode. And it is helpful that, certainly our customer base is already using us for market leading delivery, market leading app acceleration or market leading security. So there\u2019s a lot of synergy there. And I think the combination of that synergy ease of use and cost savings, it\u2019s a pretty exciting combination. Tim Horan : And just on the traffic volumes, could you give us a sense, the last two years in COVID were we like 25% above trend, 50% above trend, and do you think it kind of reverses however much it was above trend? I\u2019m not looking for exact numbers, but just some color. Tom Leighton : Yes, it was way above, certainly the first year and very strong the second year. And I would say comparison a small decreasing growth rates, still growing very strong, but less than I think have been expected. And we\u2019re seeing that the same for the internet as a whole. Now, and we\u2019re also seeing our growth be stronger than the internet as a whole, which is good. That\u2019s what we want to keep seeing, because it means we\u2019re \u2013 taking more of the internet traffic when that happens. So, I would say the step down, we\u2019ve seen so far is less than the step ups that we\u2019ve seen. And I think that\u2019s because a lot of the increased use of the internet for everything, for video, for gaming, for commerce, remote work, I think a lot of that is here to stay. But right now with all the restrictions coming off except for China, I think that\u2019s a big part of why we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a decrease in traffic growth rates right now. Tim Horan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. James Fish : Hey guys, thanks for the questions. Wanted to first start on the delivery side where frankly, we\u2019re not surprised to see slowing traffic given our tracking of what\u2019s going on in space, but it seems like it was a little bit worse for you guys. Can you just help break down where the main weakness was between web delivery versus media delivery this quarter? It sounds like media was a bit more of a surprise for you guys as it was a former growth driver. It slowing and you guys had a bunch of renewals there while we didn\u2019t have the recovery and web despite travel and hospitality traffic coming back. Can you just help us kind of triangulate where we are between some of the underlying verticals? Ed McGowan : Hey Jim, this is Ed, I\u2019ll take that one. So yes, the bigger impact was definitely on the media side. So, I called out that we had renewals and when you have renewals, big renewals concentrated in a short period of time and you have a slowdown in your traffic rate; it does accentuate the impact to revenue. Typically we see in a normal year, you\u2019d start to get back to flat line after several quarters and that sort of thing. We just think it might take a little bit longer based on the type of traffic growth rates we\u2019re seeing. In terms of the hospitality and retail, two things to think about there. We are seeing a bit of traffic increase specifically in travel, small vertical for us about 4% give or take, but remember both travel and the media \u2013 sorry, the commerce vertical tend to buy our zero overage. So it\u2019s a little bit traffic. It doesn\u2019t have as much of an impact on revenue, but in terms of the biggest impact, that\u2019s really on the media side in terms of the change in traffic. And also in terms of a percentage of overall traffic media represents us a significant portion greater than 90% of our total traffic. James Fish : Got it. And switching over to security side, how are you guys thinking about the current balance of terms subscription versus SaaS for Guardicore now that you've had it for about one and a half quarters? How do you think this settles down given certain verticals like financial services, want those term subscriptions. And lastly, any sense to what other large deals for Guardicore could be in the pipeline over the next few quarters that can swing? I think it was 50 million to 55 million for expectations for Guardicore this year. Ed McGowan : Yes. Good question. So I called out on the call that there was about four customers that had term licenses and what I'll do going forward to the extent that there's anything material we'll call it out. I'd say the majority of customers have the more traditional subscription based model, but there are our customers, especially financial services that do like to have the management controller on premise. And that's what really drives the term license aspect of it and what requires us to take the revenue up front. But again, I think the majority will be in that category. Now, keep in mind with the term license, you do have to renew that subscription when the term goes up. The typical term one to three years, Tom mentioned that we did sign a fairly large three-year term deal. So there'll be some of that maintenance and whatnot that could spread out, but you are required to take a fair chunk of that upfront. But in general, I would say that the majority would be the SaaS type deals. And as far as the pipeline goes, it's always hard to call when a deal's going to hit in any particular quarter. I don't see anything significant here in Q2, I'm expecting more of a normal quarter, but to the extent there's anything we'll certainly let you know. James Fish : Thanks, Ed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess I have two as well. Maybe just to ask a little bit more on the core delivery business, the CDM business. I guess, do you think this business just sort of declines 4% or 5% a year for the rest of calendar 2022? Or do you think to see sort of a bottom and the decline rate should improve as you go through the year? Ed McGowan : Yes, so, I think for the rest of the year, you'll see the business in decline because of the renewals that we have, we had half of them hit so far in the first quarter, the other half will hit in the second quarter. So you'll probably see a little bit of a step down in Q3 and then in Q4 tends to be your seasonally strong quarter. But you do have a tough compare. So I would expect it to be negative for the rest of this year. And obviously it'll fluctuate depending on the specific traffic levels. But Q4, we do typically see a strong season both with commerce and media, commerce has a less muted impact these days with a lot of customers, I think it's about 65% or greater have a zero overage contract. So commerce doesn't have as big of an impact, but media we've typically seen a pretty strong traffic in Q4. We expect to see a pickup in traffic probably a little less. So this year that's what we've modeled in. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then, hopefully I have all these numbers correctly if not, please correct them. But as I think about the revisions to the calendar 2022 guide that you folks provided, it looks like sales versus the streets was with all the adjustments is coming down by about 100 million give or take, 2.5%, 3% of initial expectations. But the EPS numbers, I think are coming down much more severely closer to 8%, 9% versus what the prior expectations were. Maybe just walk me through, there's a much more outside EPS adjustment to the full year numbers versus revenue. Is that just a tax rate or one of the moving pieces that are magnifying the correction on the bottom line on the EPS line versus the top line? Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So let me try to walk you through that, Rishi. So first of all, the tax impact is about $0.11. And that obviously has no \u2013 that's outside of any sort of change in the revenue. Then you get the FX impact is about $0.16. And then the Russia impact is call it another $0.09-ish give or take. So you've got about 60% of it is related to sort of those external factors and the remainder of it is related to just the revisions that we see in delivery. Amit Daryanani : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Your line is open. Frank Louthan : All right. Great. Great, thank you. So, on the traffic thing, just to be clear, this is an end user slowing down with the pie shrinking. It's just more of the pie is growing more slowly and or is some of this traffic going elsewhere? And if that's the case, who are you losing share to? Tom Leighton : No, you're right. It's the \u2013 it's just the pie is not growing as fast. The pie is not shrinking; the pie is just not growing as fast. And we believe based on talking to our customers and our carrier partners and what we see that our share of the pie is stable or growing and that we are not on balance losing share of the pie. Frank Louthan : Okay, great. Thank you. And then what sales investments do you need to make for the rest of the year to sell more with through, sell through with Linode and to sell more Guardicore, et cetera, where are you on that? Tom Leighton : Yes, so the nice thing with the Linode acquisition is we're not required to make any additional investments in sales, per se. We're going to be obviously bringing this to our channel partners and our sales reps can sell it as a matter of fact, a lot of our customers, if you look at their CDN spend to cloud spend, it's orders of magnitude, larger on the cloud side. So we're talking to the same people that are spending money there. Our teams are will be trained up and ready to go for being able to sell Linode. On the security side, you do tend to hire more specialists. And if I look at sort of where PJ is investing in sales, we are invest a lot in Guardicore not only just with sales reps, but also with technical specialists that help the sales team and professional services folks as well. So you're seeing the investment more leaning in towards the sales side, and you're getting a lot of leverage from the Linode standpoint. Frank Louthan : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Rudy Kessinger with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Rudy Kessinger : Great guys. Thanks for taking my questions. On the OTT or media, just how are your OTT customers attributing that slower traffic growth maybe between end users, eliminating or reducing the number of OTT services, they subscribe to a shortage of new content or just people getting out more with COVID mandates lifted? Tom Leighton : Well, as best we're hearing as sort of the first and third there's fewer subscriptions, in some cases, some cases subscriptions reversing. Some cases when the subscriptions are okay, there's traffic growth, but slower traffic growth, and they had anticipated and that they had seen before. And so I think, part of that is that people are just out more right now. Also on the commerce side, and there's been public reports about this, that more brick and mortar sales than there have been, and a little bit less on the online side, which is understandable I think. Given that people are apparently out and about more with less restrictions. So I think there's sort of a variety of factors and it's early days here and probably we'll learn a lot more over the next couple of months. Rudy Kessinger : Got it. And then just on delivery, you said the pricing on those large customers that renewed this quarter was about as expected. But just as you look more broadly in delivery, how is pricing pressure faring versus years past. I guess, just as I piece it together, understanding traffic growth growing more slowly, but still growing and your guys, position that you're still gaining share of that growing pie, but delivery revenue being down several points. Just how is pricing pressure faring in the broader market? Tom Leighton : Yes, good question. So I would say a couple things to respond to that. So the renewals like I said are coming in largely as expected. The big change is the rate of growth. So that also impacts your conversations going forward. So we've talked for years about how the pricing and the market is fairly efficient in terms, especially with the high volume media environment and it's really driven by volume. So to the extent that customers have less volume, the discounts rates will start to come down going forward. So I would expect to see over time if customers aren't growing at the same type of rate, they're not going to get the same kind of discount. So we may see that take hold over the next several quarters as we go through more renewals and that sort of thing. Rudy Kessinger : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Fatima Boolani with Citi. Your line is open. Fatima Boolani : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a really quick one for you in the security business, I think we \u2013 you spent a lot of time sort of flushing out the Guardicore performance in the corridor, which was pretty substantial. I think you also kicked your hat on the recovery or re-acceleration on the application security side of the security portfolio. But I'm curious if you have any comments or observations around what the network security side of the funds within that business segment is doing. Just any color there with respect to sort of competitive dynamics, sales dynamics that would be really helpful? Thank you. Tom Leighton : Yes, this is Tom. On the network side that would be [indiscernible] which is our DDoS mitigation service doing very well. And that we've seen a lot of attacks over the last year, especially around ransom or extortion DDoS attacks. And we've been in a great position to; I had a lot of customers, major enterprises that were going to be potential victims of those attacks. Also we have DNS capabilities, which are widely used as part of the network security product lines, and I would say doing, doing very well. Fatima Boolani : One other thing I would add, Tom, just that if I \u2013 if I look at the product portfolio, Bot Manager continues to do extremely well and growing at a very, very healthy clip, and we introduced our account protector this quarter and saw very, very high uptake with that in early returns on that look great. Obviously it's a newer product, so it'll take time for that to become a material contributed to revenue, but so far the early returns on that have been very good? Tom Leighton : Yes. And those are all part of our app and API protection group, which is where we're seeing the re-acceleration Ed talked about. Fatima Boolani : Got it. And just a quick one for you in terms of the housekeeping around free cash flow. So appreciate some of the puts and takes on the margin side of things. Mostly stable but curious about how we should think about free cash flow kind of given the near-term step up in CapEx, which is expected to moderate based on your guidance over the course of the year. But anything you can help us from the free cash flow margin side given the FX movements as well, and that's it for me? Tom Leighton : Sure. Yes, sure. So the \u2013 on the free cash flow side, you'll notice that Q1 tends to be a little bit lighter on the free cash flow side. And a lot of it has to do with when the timing of when bonuses get paid and you can look, if you look kind of year over year, it's sort of in line, Q1-to-Q1 it will expand as we go out throughout the year, but I think one big key takeaway. If you go to the CapEx section, which obviously impacts free cash flow quite a bit. We had originally talked about the sort of call it, Akamai excluding Linode being 13% to 14% from a CapEx perspective. And that Linode would add about two points. One of the things that we're able to do is take advantage of the slow down and growth rate of traffic to be able to pull in some of the CapEx associated with Linode and build out a little bit faster. But in addition to that, we've taken down our total CapEx. So I gave guidance for about 14% of total revenue for the year, which is about 2% better than what we had expected. So think of it as sort of folding in the Linode CapEx under the original umbrella. So that'll obviously help our free cash flow. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Elias with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Michael Elias : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I may. So you're expecting to hold an Analyst Day later this month. Any color on what we should expect to hear and as part of that, should we expect similar long-term guidance to what you gave. Your last Analyst Day just including the new compute segment? It's my first question. And the second is, you highlighted at the beginning of the call the inflation and you said that you aren't seeing the impacts of that. I'm just wondering as you think of the business and to the extent that did become a bigger issue. What are the levers that you could pull vis-\u00e0-vis pricing in order to combat inflation to be something that manifested itself? Thank you. Tom Leighton : Yes. On the first question I think Analyst Day structurally it look a lot like it did last year. So we will look at long-term, CAGR is what we're trying to achieve. We'll talk lot about the compute business and our overall strategy. So high level similar to what you saw last year in terms of the structure. Obviously we've got a cool new things to talk about with our new products, the acquisitions, Guardicore, Linode and the compute product line where we're pretty excited about. Ed McGowan : Yes. On the inflation front, a couple of things there, obviously you could, I guess you could argue that inflation is causing rates to go higher, which is impacting the U.S. dollar. So there's the FX impact of that, so that's one thing to keep in mind, I guess. But one of the advantages of sort of the hybrid work environment is it enables you to look at acquiring talent from all over the place, instead of just on the couch [ph], you can look in the middle of the country and look at other lower cost areas. So that's one tool in our toolkit. The team's done a great job on the network side with our supply chain in terms of you negotiating and leverage power. A lot of our traffic on our network today is free in terms of bandwidth, so we're somewhat insulated from that. Obviously we'll keep a close eye on the labor markets, but as Tom mentioned there could be some impact to some of our customers and the decisions that they make in terms of their spending. Already we're spending on subscriptions or video or buying the next title for gaming or the gaming console and that sort of things. So that could have an impact on traffic. So what we're doing there is obviously pulling back a little bit on our CapEx for the core network. We're actually able to redeploy some of those resources that we have that know how to build out and scale the network and just go faster in Linode, which is great. So we're sort of taking advantage of some of the opportunities that this gives us and trying to insulate ourselves from any significant impact that inflation may have on the business. Tom Leighton : Yes. And that's one of the really nice things about our business now as we really are diversified. The majority of our revenue is now security and compute, not delivery, which is a pretty big milestone for a company that not too long ago was known as a CDN or a delivery company. And so when you do have these external factors that can hurt one side of the business, they might help other sides of the business, they might help other sides of the business. For example, security being tied to the war in Ukraine, or inflation driving a need to cut costs and now we have a really good answer for our customers with Linode. So it puts our business in a much stronger position, and we're much more diversified than we've ever been. Michael Elias : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Jeff Van Rhee : Great. Thanks. Just a couple of cleanups for me. On the \u2013 on Guardicore in terms of the term licenses, were there any terms in Q4? Ed McGowan : Nothing material. There may have been about $1 million or so, but nothing really material there. Jeff Van Rhee : Okay. And then as it relates to Linode, how should we think about sales cycles there? As obviously we're going to try to blow out the sales effort and take that into the enterprise base. Just how do we think about two things there. One, the sales cycles? And then two, to date, for Linode, what was a large customer? I mean if you take a look at kind of the \u2013 maybe their top 10 customers, what would it take for somebody to crack that large customer criteria sort of into the top 10, obviously, thinking to being able to measure your success in bringing that product to your enterprise base? Ed McGowan : Yes. Good question. So the sales cycles will vary. As Tom mentioned, there are certain workloads that are built in a container that's easy to move, so those can move relatively quickly. We've started our training, rolled out our compensation plan, so our sales team is starting to build the funnel. We're having good conversations with customers. We're starting to build out additional functionality. We put out a press release about our managed database capabilities the other day. We're be building out more locations. You'll hear a lot more from Adam when we get to the Analyst Day about specifically what we're doing and where we're heading.  I would say you start \u2013 in terms of how I'm looking at success, which we should start to see some of that materialize towards the back half of the year and really looking at what is our exit run rate going into next year and then what does that funnel look like. But we should start to see a lot of this materialize towards the back half of the year. It's probably a normal sales cycle. You got some early wins. You've got developers from customers that can start playing around adding new applications and that sort of stuff. But I think in terms of the more meaningful, impactful deal sizes, those should happen towards the back half of the year and into next year. Jeff Van Rhee : Okay. That's helpful. Last one for me. I think on the traffic side, you mentioned OTT as well as gaming and in particular, in general, being most visible in the most recent quarter. I mean, anything notable difference in the trends of those two traffic types? Or is it just generally, behavior you or expect from people getting outside and unlocking? Any differences there? Ed McGowan : Yes. Good question. I'd say sort of the latter, what you just said there that is probably more of that people getting out. That's \u2013 you see that more on the video side in terms of less hours streamed, if you're watching 10 hours a day, you're maybe doing eight or six or whatever. But gaming is more of a seasonal issue. I'd say we saw more of an impact on gaming, not as many releases that had probably a bit weaker than we would have expected. I think in terms of the trends, it depends on what the cycle looks like going into the back half of the year in terms of major gaming releases. But the video side, I think, is a lot more behavioral. Jeff Van Rhee : Yes. Okay, all right. Thank you. Tom Barth : Operator \u2013 time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Will Power with Baird. Your line is open. Will Power : Okay. Great. Thanks for sneaking me in. Maybe, Tom, I'd love to get a little more color on the strength within compute. Anything else you could provide with respect to key drivers in the quarter would be great. Tom Leighton : Yes. We've been working on edge computing, doing edge computing services for close to 20 years. We have the edge worker solution that has function as a service and thousands of POPs around the world, EdgeKV database capability and more and more applications having \u2013 our customers having an interest in having them work at the edge. You get tremendous scalability, instant scalability, you can spin up your edge worker app a few milliseconds and be really close to the end user. And I think we get more business there as you go forward, more and more of our customers are using it as they move to the \u2013 an API model and as you get 5G and as you get IoT and you have more demand for lower latency and scalability at the edge.  And of course, Linode is really exciting because now you get the core cloud compute capability. So you can just take your container, your app and the container and move it over to Akamai, and have the whole thing end-to-end from the core of the cloud to the edge. You can build your app on Akamai. You can run it on Akamai. You could deliver it on Akamai. You can do the compute you need at the real edge in thousands of places. And of course, we'll wrap it all in security for you. So I think compute is strong on its own from what we had. Now you get more strength with Linode and then you wrap it all together in the Akamai platform, which is really unique in terms of having 4,000 POPs. There is nothing like it in terms of having a true edge network, the scalability you get and the performance you get from that. Will Power : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then maybe just a quick question on thoughts around potential M&A from here given valuation compressions in the market. How does that change the landscape for you? How you look at things and maybe appetite here, particularly coming on the heels of the Linode deal? Tom Leighton : Yes. We're continuing to look at possible acquisitions. Obviously, we've done two large ones in a short period of time. I don't expect that to be the norm. We're generating a lot of cash, and we're going to use that to reinvest in the business, particularly in security and compute. So it's not impossible over time. You'll see other acquisitions like that. And probably, several smaller acquisitions like we've always done. Tech tuck-ins, adjacent products. So I think what you've seen is what you'll get, but not two big ones right away. That's not the norm. But we saw a real chance to have a game changer in enterprise security with Guardicore. Really, the right product to stop ransomware and a game changer in Linode, a leading alternative cloud that gives us \u2013 really completes the Akamai picture, I would say, in terms of powering and protecting life online, being able to build, run, deliver, accelerate and secure your app all in 1 platform is really exciting for us. Will Power : Great. Thank you. Tom Barth : Thank you, everyone, for joining us tonight. I know we ran a little long, so we appreciate your patience. And in closing, we will be presenting at several investor conferences and road shows throughout the rest of the second quarter, including our Analyst Day in New York City on May 18. Details of all these events can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Thanks for joining us and all of us here at Akamai wish you and yours continue good out. Have a great evening. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Akamai Technologies Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tom Barth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent Akamai's view on August 9, 2022. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Thomson Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered strong results in the second quarter despite the ongoing challenges with the global economic environment and slower Internet traffic growth. Q2 revenue was $903 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 9% in constant currency. This result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our Security and Compute businesses, which when taken together, were up 30% in constant currency. These 2 business lines now account for 54% of our overall revenue. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $1.35 per diluted share, down 5% year-over-year, but up 0.5% in constant currency. As Ed will discuss later, EPS was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates and a higher effective tax rate compared to last year. Free cash flow was very strong at $223 million in Q2 and it accounted for 25% of revenue. We've been leveraging our financial strength to make substantial investments in enterprise security and cloud computing. We've also used some of this cash to buy back additional stock. In the first half of the year, we spent $268 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares. This puts us on track to go beyond what's needed to offset dilution from employee equity programs this year. I'll now say a few words about each of our 3 main lines of business : Security, Compute and Delivery, starting with Security. Our Security Solutions generated revenue of $381 million in Q2, up 17% year-over-year and up 21% in constant currency. Growth in security was driven primarily by our app and API security portfolio, which includes our market-leading web app firewall, Bot Manager, Account Protector and Page Integrity Manager solutions. Our Zero Trust enterprise security portfolio, led by Guardicore, also performed well in Q2, with numerous significant customer wins. A leading global provider of financial data concerned about ransomware, added Guardicore segmentation solution to the 7 security products they already buy from Akamai. A major insurance company in France became a new customer for Akamai when they adopted our Guardicore solution to help meet European financial regulations. The sale, led by one of our carrier partners, is indicative of the excitement we're seeing for our Zero Trust solutions among our partners. In Australia's largest telecom provider, Telstra, expanded their business with us by adding our Secure Web Gateway solution to their portfolio of Akamai products. They told us, \"As part of Telstra's journey in delivering fit-for-purpose solutions, Akamai has been a key industry partner with network-based anti-phishing malware protection and content filtering. Telstra blocks millions of threats every single day, and Akamai is a key partner in that protection.\" Overall, our Zero Trust solutions delivered $43 million of revenue in Q2, up 59% year-over-year in constant currency. This is an area where we're making -- continuing to make major investments and where we anticipate significant future growth. Turning now to Compute. I'm very pleased to report that the revenue for our Compute product group was $106 million in Q2, up 74% year-over-year and up 78% in constant currency. As a reminder, the Compute product group includes Linode and Akamai solutions for Edge computing, storage cloud optimization and Edge applications. A common theme that I heard when I met with executives from around the world in Q2 was their growing concern about being locked into contracts with cloud giants that are consuming large and rapidly increasing shares of their IT budgets. They want more choice in compute and are open to alternative clouds like Linode as a more efficient way to build, run and secure their applications. As a result, many large enterprises have begun testing the Linode platform, including a major U.S. airline, one of the world's top gaming companies and a global provider of weather data. Major media companies, in particular, expressed significant concerns with their growing use of the giant clouds. Not only are the cost high, in part because of the fees from moving data from cloud storage to a CDN for delivery, but they're also concerned about their increasing reliance on a direct competitor. As an example, I'm very pleased to announce that we recently signed a contract with one of the world's largest media companies to run a critical new workload on Linode. The service is live today, and we anticipate that it will generate millions of dollars of annual revenue as their usage grows over time. This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to our potential for future revenue growth in Compute. Cloud computing is a fast-growing, multi-hundred billion dollar market. And as we scale Linode to be enterprise grade with pops and hundreds of locations around the world, we should be in an excellent position to capture a share of this market, particularly from companies that value our industry-leading security and delivery solutions and that don't want to be locked in to more expensive options with a cloud giant that competes against them. Our Delivery products generated revenue of $417 million in Q2, down 11% year-over-year and down 8% in constant currency. These results were clearly impacted by a continued deceleration in traffic growth among our largest media customers and by the lower unit pricing we provided as part of their recent contract renewals.  It's important to note that Akamai remains the market leader in delivery by far. Moreover, customer churn in the first half of this year remained at record lows, and lost annual revenue from churned accounts in Q2 was even less than in Q1.  We also saw some notable delivery customers move business to our platform in Q2 after trying out competing solutions. No matter which competitor they've been working with, they chose Akamai because of our superior performance and reliability.  Like many companies, we're managing through a time of substantial economic headwinds and uncertainty with escalating inflation, the strengthening U.S. dollar, growing concerns about a global recession, escalating geopolitical tensions and conflicts, and a slowing of Internet traffic growth as the world tries to return to normal in the midst of a pandemic. As Ed will talk about shortly, I think it's prudent to assume that these headwinds will dampen our growth rates and profitability over the next several quarters, particularly in our Delivery business, which is being impacted by the challenges that many major media companies have recently reported.  Given the enormous market opportunity in front of us, we will continue to focus our investment on Zero Trust enterprise security led by Guardicore, and cloud computing, led by Linode. These investments, combined with the economic headwinds I just mentioned, will likely result in our operating margin remaining below 30% in the near term. We expect our margins to improve over time as our Security and Compute businesses continue to grow and account for a larger share of total revenue.  In addition, we're embarking on several major initiatives to reduce cost and improve operational efficiency that should help return our margins to 30% or better in the medium to longer term. As Ed will discuss further, these initiatives include leveraging Linode to significantly reduce our cloud spend with hyperscalers, slowing the capital expenditures for our delivery platform and optimizing our real estate footprint.  While these are challenging times to be sure, I believe that Akamai is on the right track for long-term growth and success and that we're well positioned because of our unique global-edge platform, our market-leading security and delivery solutions, our new compute capabilities which provide great performance at an affordable cost, our premier enterprise customer base and our strong financial position and profitable business model. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on Q2 and our outlook going forward. Ed? Edward McGowan : Thank you, Tom. As Tom mentioned, Akamai delivered another solid quarter in Q2. Q2 revenue was $903 million, up 6% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. Revenue was in line with our guidance and was led by our Security and Compute businesses. As we mentioned on our last call, we expected significant foreign exchange headwinds to impact our revenue in Q2. The much stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted our year-over-year growth rate by 3 points or approximately $29 million of revenue year-over-year and $14 million on a sequential basis.  On a combined basis, our Security and Compute businesses represented 54% of total revenue, growing 26% year-over-year and 30% in constant currency. Security revenue was $381 million and grew 17% year-over-year and 21% in constant currency, with continued strength from our Zero Trust business led by Guardicore. Guardicore delivered approximately $14 million of revenue in Q2. Security represented 42% of total revenue in Q2, which is up 4 points from Q2 a year ago.  Compute revenue was $106 million in Q2, growing 74% year-over-year and 78% in constant currency. Linode contributed revenue of approximately $32 million in the second quarter. Delivery revenue was $417 million, down 11% year-over-year and 8% in constant currency. It's worth noting that while traffic on our network continued to grow, the rate of that traffic growth declined sequentially in Q2.  As Tom mentioned, we believe that the current macroeconomic environment has had the greatest impact on customers in our media vertical, most notably in advertising and gaming. These challenges are most apparent in our delivery results.  Also, as we talked about at our Analyst Day in May, we started to align our pricing strategy with the new traffic growth rates we have seen on our network over the last 2 quarters. In addition to scaling back discounts provided upon renewal, we decided to turn away some business from a very small number of customers who have extreme traffic peaks compared to their daily usage patterns. While this will result in slightly less revenue, it will enable us to significantly lower our network CapEx as we focus on cash flow from our Delivery business to help accelerate our investments in faster-growing areas like Compute and Security.  Sales in our international markets represented 47% of total revenue in Q2, unchanged from Q1. International revenue grew 6% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $477 million and grew 6% year-over-year. Going now to costs and profitability. Cash gross margin was 75%. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 62%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $292 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $388 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 43%. Non-GAAP operating income was $262 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. It is worth noting that our non-GAAP operating margin was negatively impacted by approximately 1 point due to unfavorable foreign exchange.  Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $104 million. This was much better than we expected, partly due to some Linode specific CapEx that pushed from Q2 into Q3 as well as some savings from our strategy of being more selective on certain types of customer traffic. These savings were most apparent in our network CapEx, excluding Linode, which was only about 3% of revenue. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $120 million or $0.74 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $216 million or $1.35 of earnings per diluted share, down 5% year-over-year and up 1/2 of 1% in constant currency. It's worth noting that foreign exchange negatively impacted our non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.07. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $42 million based on a Q2 effective tax rate of approximately 16%. This was about 1.5 points higher than last year. Moving now to cash and our use of capital. As of June 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.3 billion. During the second quarter, we spent approximately $165 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 1.6 million shares. Our ongoing share repurchase activity has resulted in a net reduction in our non-GAAP fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 4 million shares or roughly 2% on a year-over-year basis. We ended Q2 with approximately $1.5 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Our intention is to continue to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases.  Before I provide our Q3 outlook and an update to our 2022 guidance, I want to highlight several factors. First, with nearly 50% of our revenue coming from outside the U.S., foreign exchange continues to be a significant headwind to our reported results. At current spot rates, our guidance now assumes foreign exchange will have a negative $114 million impact to revenue in 2022 on a year-over-year basis.  As I mentioned previously, foreign exchange also impacts our margins and earnings. We estimate FX will negatively impact non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 1 point year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings by approximately $0.31 for the full year 2022.  Second, we are incrementally more cautious on the outlook for traffic growth in Q3 and Q4. Based on our year-to-date trend, plus what we are hearing from other large Internet companies, we are anticipating a slower than usual traffic growth rate for the remainder of 2022. Third, as a result of the expected slower traffic growth rate and our updating pricing strategy that we noted earlier, we anticipate CapEx to be significantly below our previous outlook.  Finally, as Tom mentioned, we expect the more challenging macroeconomic environment to dampen our revenue growth and margins in the near term. When combined with the impact of renewing 8 of our top 10 customers in the first half of the year, we expect Delivery revenue to decline at a slightly higher rate on a year-over-year basis for the next 2 quarters. As a result of these factors, we also expect margins to decline over the near term as well.  We believe strongly in the long-term opportunities in front of us, especially in Security and Compute, and therefore, planned to continue to invest to exploit the market opportunity in these areas. That said, as Tom highlighted, we are embarking on several major initiatives to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. Potential savings for each of these areas is in the tens of millions of dollars. Specifically, we are planning to do the following 3 things. First, significantly reduce our cloud spend with hyperscalers as we migrate internal Akamai workloads to Linode. Second, realized savings from our strategy of being more selective on certain types of customer traffic, which we expect will result in both lower capital expenditures and depreciation expense. And third, optimize our real estate footprint as the hybrid work experience becomes more permanent.  Now turning to our Q3 guidance. We are projecting revenue in the range of $868 million to $883 million or up 1% to 3% as reported or 5% to 7% in constant currency over Q3 2021. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $11 million impact on Q3 revenue compared to Q2 levels and a negative $36 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 74%. In the short term, our gross margin is negatively impacted by our continued investment in Guardicore and the Linode-related headcount as well as higher third-party cloud costs.  However, we are confident that this is a short-term impact only. We expect our gross margin to expand to the high 70% long-term target model as we see continued strong growth from both Guardicore and Linode as we reduce our third-party cloud costs over time.  Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $283 million to $291 million. We anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins of approximately 41%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $125 million to $128 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 27% for Q3.  As mentioned previously, the near-term decline in operating margin is due to slower traffic and revenue growth, our annual merit-based wage increase, which become effective July 1, the negative impact from foreign exchange, investments associated with Guardicore and Linode and increased third-party cloud costs. As our Security and Compute business continue to grow and we reap the benefits of the cost savings actions I described earlier, we are confident that our operating margins will return to 30% and then grow from there.  Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $109 million to $119 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the third quarter. This represents approximately 13% of projected total revenue. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.21 to $1.26. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $37 million to $38 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 16%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 160 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we now expect revenue of $3.57 billion to $3.61 billion, which is up 3% to 4% year-over-year as reported or up 6% to 8% in constant currency. We continue to expect Security growth of approximately 20% in constant currency for the full year 2022. We now estimate non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 28% to 29% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.19 to $5.37. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 16% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 160 million shares. Finally, full year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 12% to 13% of revenue. In closing, while the macroeconomic backdrop has become more uncertain, we believe that we are in the right markets with differentiated products that remain highly valued by our customers. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from James Breen of William Blair. James Breen : Can you just talk about, obviously, the revenue guidance for the third quarter is lower than where consensus by about $10 million? Can you talk about the trade-off between margins and going after some of this delivery traffic in general because it's -- the EBITDA margins are about the same, but obviously, the growth is slowing at the top line. Edward McGowan : Jim, this is Ed. So in terms of the guide, there's really 2 pieces to it. The first one is obviously FX has gotten incrementally worse. That's probably about half of the delta. The rest of it is the slower traffic that we talked about. I think your question was specific to the trade-off that we're making. The first immediate impact that you get on that trade-off from taking less of that peak traffic as you save on CapEx. So that will make its way through the P&L through lower depreciation and obviously immediately through cash flow. And so the decision that we've made is obviously, as we talked about in May, as traffic levels have come down, the discounts that we offer upon renewal are lower. And in some cases, we've seen a small handful of customers that have the traffic. Their peaks are still growing at pretty significant rates, but their day-to-day traffic is not. So there's a formula that we go through in a trade-off that we made that I think makes a lot of sense for us, especially as I look at the types of returns we can get from the faster-growing areas like security and compute. James Breen : So the shift in general just to a more -- a little bit more of an asset-light business and focusing on some of these other areas? Edward McGowan : Yes. I mean, I would say, obviously, compute can be, I wouldn't call it an asset-heavy business, but it does have a fair bit of CapEx. We talked about our CapEx for Linode being about 2% of revenue in total. And obviously, it's going to be a little bit front-end loaded. We actually took the advantage to try to spend a little bit more for Linode. Based on some of the conversations we're having, we're starting to see some good demand. And obviously, Tom talked about signing a pretty significant customer in the quarter. So what we're doing though, on the Akamai, of course, I call it the legacy Akamai delivery business is we are being a bit more selective in reducing CapEx. I made a comment that our network CapEx excluding Linode was 3%. That's typically around, call it, 8% to 10%, at least where it's been running over the last couple of years. So I think it's just a question of being more selective with certain types of traffic. It's really a handful of customers that have that type of traffic pattern. It's generally event-driven. And what we're seeing is it's just a better return to shift some of that investment in other places. James Breen : Great. And then just maybe just one for Tom. On Linode, can you just talk about some of the success you're having sort of selling that product into your existing customer base? Thomson Leighton : Yes. Obviously, very early days. We've got a lot of work ahead of us with Linode, as we've talked about. But it's great to land our first very large customer, putting a critical app. Actually, it's for transcoding, user content onto the Linode platform. As I mentioned, that's just that app alone as it scales is worth several million dollars a year of revenue for us. And tip of the iceberg, this is a customer that spends many hundreds of millions of dollars a year on cloud computing. And that's just 1 customer. So a lot of good opportunity ahead, and we're making good progress on our road map for Linode. Operator : The next question is from James Fish of Piper Sandler. James Fish : We've seen some security vendors report here and Security is going through kind of actually still a strong environment despite the macro. And when I look at your normalized rate of about 17%, it's a bit lighter than what we saw in Q1 in the last couple of years really. What's going on, especially on the core WAF and DDoS and in Bot management in terms of the sizing and growth against some of the newer solutions like EAA and PIM here? And is there a way to think about if you guys are seeing any higher net churn overall or how to balance net new business versus the expansion that you're seeing with your existing customers and security? Thomson Leighton : I'll start with that and then maybe Ed will add some comments. Security is very strong. We have the market-leading WAF by far. In fact, you look at their most recent Magic Quadrants and analyst ratings, and we've widened the gap with competition. Bot Manager also the market leader by far. Now we have Account Protector built on top, growing very well. EAA is small today, good opportunity for growth, particularly coming on the following Guardicore. Guardicore, very exciting. You think about the enterprise security landscape, and our segmentation, I think, has been something that historically was overlooked mainly because it wasn't done very well. But I think as you look to the future, it's probably the most important thing an enterprise can do. You could buy everybody's security products today, a company could buy everything. And now we're still going to find a way in somewhere. And the real key is to identify when the malware has gotten inside, where it is and block it from spreading. And that's why Guardicore is the best defense against malware and ransomware, and they have the best solution as rated by analysts, and we see really good traction there, but still on relatively small numbers. Page Integrity Manager, a relatively new product but a very bright future. Again, it's new, so it's still small today, but that's going to allow companies to satisfy the new PCI requirement, something that's hard for a company to do on their own.  The new requirements say that a company has to have safeguards against malware that gets into the digital supply chain and winds up on their users' browser. And that's just very hard for any enterprise to do. But when Akamai is delivering that content, we can place our scripts on the page to make sure that the user experience is safe and to make sure that if the user has ingested malware somewhere in the supply chain that we can identify and block it so the user is not compromised. So I think when you look at our security product portfolio really doing very well, and we're in early days with some of the most exciting products that have a lot of future runway. James Fish : Got it. And maybe for Ed, on the delivery side, Ed, you alluded to a handful of customers that you guys essentially don't really want to deal with going forward just in terms of the type of traffic that you're delivering for them versus obviously the peaks versus the average. Taking a step back, what are you seeing in terms of this new pricing strategy versus kind of the churn as well as how to think about this removal of customers on the second half guide and if it really impacts the Security business going forward? Edward McGowan : Yes. Great question, Jim. So let me just clarify that we're not doing business with these customers, just kind of taking a step back, like I say, it's a handful of customers. And typically, what you look at is these are multi-CDN customers that use many different vendors and tend to have big peaks for events. And the way you look at those customers is, there's a certain amount of day-to-day traffic you get, a certain price point that you're willing to sell at and there's a certain peak to average ratio that you're looking at. So as we go and renew some of these customers, we're being a lot more disciplined in terms of the -- taking a different approach as far as the level of discount that we're willing to provide. So therefore, the customer has to make a decision about still using us, but how are they going to handle those peaks? then going to straighten them out over a longer period of time, try to find additional peak in the market, et cetera. So they're still very big customers of ours, but we are pushing back a bit in terms of how much peak we're willing to take on the network. And as a result, we may lose a little bit of that day-to-day traffic, but we're still a significant vendor. As far as the impact on security and other products, we have not seen any impact on that. We're not losing these customers. They're not leaving the platform. It's just -- we are holding the line a bit more on price, and we may lose a little bit of the delivery as a result. But we're also losing a lot of that big peak and that ratio is getting more in line with what makes more economic sense. Operator : The next question is from Rishi Jaluria of RBC. Rishi Jaluria : Wonderful. Maybe first, I want to touch on Security. So you've obviously been talking a lot about the Delivery business. But we've seen a pretty decent decel in Security this quarter relative to last quarter, even looking on a constant currency basis. And look, on a constant currency basis, you saw only less than $6 million added sequentially from Q1 to Q2. And what should be a pretty strong security spending environment, at least based on what others in the space are saying. Can you maybe just help us understand what's going on in the security business and just how we should be thinking about that going forward? And then I have a follow-up. Edward McGowan : Yes, Rishi, sure. So I'll take that. Keep in mind, if you remember last quarter, we talked about Guardicore revenue having about $7 million of onetime license revenue, which was a pull forward of about 1% or so of growth into that quarter. So that impacted it as well. We are -- one other thing to keep in mind, too, if you recall, with our [indiscernible] business during 2020 and 2021, we had a pretty strong uptick from the educational vertical.  And there, that was when kids were working from -- sorry, working from home, doing school from home. And there was some government funding that was enabling folks to be able to work or go to school remotely and that funding has gone away. So we've seen a little bit of a decline there. I think it's a combination of those 2 factors that led to a little bit lighter of a sort of a sequential growth quarter-over-quarter.  But some of the other things that we're seeing underlying our business, we're seeing very strong demand in Bot Manager. Account Protector is a newer version of that product or an add-on. That's going pretty well, but it's still pretty early days. It takes a while for that to -- good to add to growth. But those are some factors that you need to consider as you think about the slowdown in the growth there. Rishi Jaluria : Got it. That's really helpful. And then just maybe I want to be explicit about macro in the guidance. When we think about your guidance, you talked about all the moving pieces between customers and turning [indiscernible] piece of the business and all that kind of stuff. But I want to be explicit, what are you assuming in terms of the macro environment? Are you assuming it kind of stays as it is today? Or are you seeing some sort of macro degradation? And maybe to really round that out, right? If I think about your last true recession that you are around for, right, '08,'09, even though traffic continued to grow at a nice rate during those years. Pricing compression led to a pretty big decel, I know this is obviously a very different business than it was 15 years ago. But maybe I just want to understand your macro assumptions and maybe tied into the macro assumptions, what you're assuming for the pricing environment. Again, consistent with what you're seeing, worse, better? Any color there would be helpful. Edward McGowan : Sure. Yes. So let's see, I'll start with pricing. So one of the things -- the biggest area where you see pricing impact the business is on delivery. We don't see the typical price declines that you would expect to see in the Security business. The business just doesn't work that way. And I don't anticipate that being a significant problem for us. Obviously, we're anticipating that traffic is not going to recover to growth rates like we've seen in the past. We said that in our prepared remarks.  So kind of a muted -- more muted Q4 than we typically see. Q4 tends to be a strong quarter for us. We anticipate that the macroeconomic environment is not going to get any better. One of the areas that I'm keeping a close eye on is Europe. We're seeing a lot of challenges in Europe, seeing energy prices, for example, are really, really high over in Europe. We're coming into the winter session. So you could see potentially less graphic related to people cutting subscriptions or doing things like that, less shopping online. So that's one of the things that I'm concerned about.  And then also the recession and the impact that it could have on our customers potentially delaying buying decisions and things like that. But obviously, we're producing a tremendous amount of cash. The business is in great shape. It's much more well diversified than in the past. So I think we'll weather the storm pretty well. But I do think, as Tom and I both mentioned in our prepared remarks that it is going to dampen our revenue growth a bit here and also our margins for a short period of time. Operator : The next question is from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Joshua Baer : This is Josh Baer on for Keith. I wanted to ask about Linode. Are these enterprises that are testing out the platform? Are they considering Linode as primary cloud vendor? And I guess assuming it's a multi-cloud strategy approach, what are some use cases that enterprises are testing with Linode? What types of workloads or products do you expect to be popular with enterprises? Thomson Leighton : Well, really, any kind of cloud compute application is suitable for Linode. Obviously, we support containers as a service, VM as a service. So anything you do in the cloud you could do on the Linode. I think the use cases initially and how the customers are viewing it as trying it out with some new applications, and in the one case of the media company we talked about, it's a critical application. They're running their new transcoding app for user-generated content on us. It's about as critical as it gets. And as I mentioned, that may become worth millions of dollars as it scales up, but this is a company that's spending many hundreds of millions of dollars in the cloud. So it's not a situation where we think you're just going to switch all that on to Akamai right away. But it is a business that I think we can really grow and that we're in an excellent position to tap into a very large cloud computing market. That market is a couple of hundred billion dollars growing at a very rapid clip. And Akamai is a trusted partner for many major enterprises that are looking for some diversification, that want a reliable partner, has great performance which we do with our distributor platform, knows how to handle scale and at an affordable price point, which we're in an excellent position to provide. So I'm really optimistic about the future of our Compute business. Joshua Baer : Great. And it sounds like a lot of the focus is on the hyperscalers and the enterprise opportunity. Just also wanted to ask if you're seeing any changes in the competitive landscape around some of the other alternative cloud providers serving SMB just in regard to any pricing changes or any other moving pieces in the market. Thomson Leighton : Well, as you know, one of our competitors there raised pricing. And I would say, so far, there's not a big change in the competitive landscape in the SMB market. We do intend to offer other services such as security to that customer base. But I think the real focus for us is bringing -- upscaling Linode to make it really enterprise -- major enterprise grade and scaling it out and making it be much more distributed, which will obviously improve performance. And going after the large enterprises, many of our customers spend 10 or more times as much with the major clouds than they do with us for delivery and security. And so that's a great opportunity for Akamai to be able to now provide them with compute as well, so that they can build their apps on Akamai, run them obviously deliver and secure them on Akamai. Really an incredible opportunity. Operator : The next question is from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Frank Louthan : Can you just be a little bit more clear, some of the -- you mentioned the media companies and the issues with some of the traffic slowing down. Do you think this is more of a near-term issue or seasonal? And then how long do you think before some of that traffic begins to come back a bit? Thomson Leighton : Yes. As we mentioned, there's a variety of factors that are impacting the media companies and hence traffic. You've sort of got a year -- I mean we still got COVID, but this is more like a non-COVID year lapping a COVID year. And so people are out and about more, and so there's less traffic growth due to that. You've got impacts of what, in some places is a recession.  And you've seen some of the media companies report that they've got their own challenges with usage. And so that tends to reduce traffic. Obviously, we've got foreign exchange headwinds, which impacts the revenue we get from media companies overseas. And so all of that is impacting traffic in the media business for Akamai. I don't see those as being permanent. And we do expect over the long term that the traffic returns to more normal growth rates and that the revenue for the Delivery business stabilizes. May take a little while, several quarters at this point, but I don't think it's a long-term phenomenon. Frank Louthan : Okay. Great. And can you quantify how much CapEx you might be saving annually from sort of the pushing out some of the higher volume folks? Edward McGowan : Yes. So probably the best way to think about that, if you remember, coming into the year, we were sort of guiding that 15% to 16% range. We said, Linode will be a couple of points. We're now down to 12% to 13%. So that's somewhere in the 3% to 4% range is probably a good number to be working with. I also gave the data point out that our network-only sort of legacy Akamai Delivery business or Akamai network CapEx is around 3% where typically it had run around 8%.  Now we'll, obviously, you still have to invest in the network, and we expect traffic to grow, et cetera. But I think we can remain in a lower than sort of long-term trend model here for a while. Obviously, if we see significant increase in traffic, we'll obviously have better delivery results and deal with it at the time. But kind of looking out over the next several quarters and into next year, I'd expect to see the CapEx levels at sort of levels you're seeing here. Operator : Next question is from Fatima Boolani of Citi. Fatima Boolani : Ed, this was for you, just with respect to a lot of the detailed commentary on your expectation of the delivery franchise for the second half. So a number of moving pieces here. But what I want to focus on is maybe doubling back to some of your comments from the last earnings call with respect to the observations around gaming, traffic slowing down.  So I am inferring up the bulk of the pain that you're talking about from a delivery standpoint is purely coming from the OTT side, but I'd love to kind of get a confirmation and maybe get more of an in-depth under the hooded view of where you're seeing the most, I guess, elasticity or volatility from a traffic type standpoint? And how you're thinking about those trends in maybe a more granular fashion in the back half, especially on the back of the renewals that are now behind you? Edward McGowan : Yes, good question. So let me just try to answer it this way. Obviously, our largest source of traffic is video traffic. And we are seeing video traffic, the growth rate of that is slower than we had expected. Still growing but slower than we expected. Probably the more noticeable areas would be gaming, software and then advertising-related, so some of the portal, news portals, et cetera, that sort of stuff that are impacted by advertising that's the area.  But if you have a slowdown in video, it's such a significant portion of traffic that can tend to be the biggest driver. Now will that recover? What we typically see in Q4 is we do see somewhat of a device cycle where you see new devices coming online, oftentimes you see new content that comes on in Q4. There's back-to-school. There is the start of the fall sports season that we typically see a big increase in traffic. What we're looking at this year is we're being more cautious.  We're still expecting it to increase like we see in Q4, but just not at the levels that we've seen in the past just based on the trends that we're seeing in the market today, what we're hearing from other companies, what we're getting from our customers. But that's probably the best way to think about it. Fatima Boolani : I appreciate that. And just really quickly, on the macro commentary that you shared especially with some of the key observations in Europe. I'm curious about any concerns or observations with respect to sales cycle elongation, deal decision -- delays in deal decision and deal making from a procurement standpoint, anything tangible that you can share with us just with respect to those dynamics, just as the broader economy sort of softened. Edward McGowan : It's a good question. I'd say it's still kind of early days, but that's certainly something that we're looking at. Security tends to be one of the places that you wouldn't delay a purchase, especially if you're under an attack. If you're not under attack, sometimes you might elongate that a little bit. But we haven't seen anything yet that's worth calling out in terms of elongating the sales cycles.  I think I'm more concerned with what happens going into the winter, and there's talk of cutting back use of natural gas and the impact on GDP, that obviously would have an impact on not just Akamai, but on many, many companies. So that's something you look out for. And then also just as you get into a situation like that, keeping a close eye on receivables and making sure that you not -- your customers are in good financial health. So far, no issues there, but that's again something that we'd be looking out for. Operator : The next question is from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Timothy Horan : Questions on Linode. How much can you save enterprises do you think on their compute bill with Linode? Secondly, is this a good run rate for the Compute segment or maybe any color on what the growth rates you're kind of looking for there? Thomson Leighton : Yes, the savings can be substantial. The list pricing that we offer for Linode is substantially less than when you see the hyperscalers offering, that's public information. And for major enterprises, obviously, you can have some discount to that. And the really good news is that we believe we can do this at substantial margins. So as we grow the business, actually, they'll improve our margins overall. And Ed, do you want to take the second part of that? Edward McGowan : Yes. So in terms of the run rate and the growth expectations, yes, I mean, I think in terms of the near-term run rate, that's probably a reasonable place to peg it. What Tom and Adam talked about in May at our Analyst Day is we're making some substantial upgrades to the capabilities that Linode has, that doesn't happen overnight. So really, we will start to see -- the big enterprise growth will be into '23 and the back half of '23 '24, et cetera.  But we do expect pretty substantial growth here, obviously, grew 74-plus percent in Compute, but a good place to put it for now, but it will take some time to build out the capacity as well as the added features. We're going, as Tom said, at a pretty good pace here, but that's when you really start to see the exciting growth is once all that capability is up and available. Operator : The next question is from Rudy Kessinger of D.A. Davidson. Rudy Kessinger : Great. So for the balance of the year, you're taking the revenue guide down by $55 million. You said FX headwinds for the year now at $114 million versus $100 million previously. So ex that FX headwind, you're taking it down by $41 million. I'm curious if you could kind of bucket it out that $41 million reduction between lower traffic growth outlook or macro challenges versus maybe some of the revenue you're losing from potentially taking less traffic from some of those customers with high peaks or other areas where you're reducing the guide. Edward McGowan : Yes. I'd say the majority of it comes from the slower traffic. That's going to be the biggest component of it. The impact for some of the traffic we're turning away isn't all that significant, but does contribute to it. I don't have an exact percentage for you, but that's not a significant part of it. And then the macroeconomic would be the remainder. So if you were to stack rank it would be slower traffic macroeconomic and then the impact from turning away some of the traffic that we talked about in terms of the peaky traffic. Rudy Kessinger : Okay. And then on Linode, I guess I'm curious, like what is your total internal spend with the hyperscales currently? What percent do you think you could move to Linode over time? And what's the kind of expected cost savings you think you can get from that? Thomson Leighton : Yes, we're spending about $100 million a year annually now with the cloud companies. And over the next year or 2, ultimately, we would migrate pretty much -- most all of that on to Linode. And substantial savings. So that's why it's one of our several initiatives we're taking to improve margins. Also, it's great to be using our own services, and it will help us as we do the work with Linode to make it enterprise-ready, to be using it across the spectrum of applications at Akamai. We're very much like our customers and looking for ways to save on cost and get great performance out of our cloud compute platform. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Jeff Van Rhee : Just a couple for me. I think on the Security side, I just want to clarify, I know you said you're comfortable at 24% revenue growth. To be clear, as reported or constant currency and then just kind of the puts and takes of being able to sustain that 20% in the outyear, given kind of the deceleration we're seeing right now? Edward McGowan : Sure. I'll take the first part, Tom, you can take the second part in terms of the future. That's in constant currency. And just remember, Jeff, that the Guardicore acquisition anniversary is in the fourth quarter. Thomson Leighton : Yes. And in terms of the longer range, obviously, we're seeing very good growth in our flagship products, Web App Firewall and Bot Manager. They're the largest contribution of revenue. Really good growth, but on smaller numbers, obviously, for Zero Trust enterprise computing. In the longer time frame, I think that's what drives a lot of the growth in security. The infrastructure category growing more slowly today, also on a moderate size number. But I think in the long term, you see the enterprise Zero Trust security group grow, led by Guardicore as the market leader in stopping ransomware. . Jeff Van Rhee : So I guess as a bucket, no clear sort of things you would call out that should drive acceleration or deceleration, maybe a different way to look at it. Thomson Leighton : Well, there's the three categories we have today. The biggest is app in API security, very strong growth. I think we get continued strong growth there. A lot of innovation going on with Account Protector, Page Integrity Manager we talked about being really important for PCI compliance. We have a new audience hijacking prevention capability that looks really cool.  Infrastructure is moderate size today, and that's not growing as fast. That's your DDoS protection and your D&S defenses. And then the really high-growth area, Zero Trust enterprise security led by Guardicore, but it's the smallest of the 3. And so you sort of have 3 different comps with a little bit different dynamic in each. Jeff Van Rhee : Okay. And one last, if I could, on delivery. Obviously, you're making some changes around the peaking traffic. What about pricing disciplines just in traffic in general? I think you had commented last quarter you were taking a much more sort of across-the-board conservative approach to pricing. Just pricing outside that peaking, how has your approach changed this quarter and likely to change the rest of year? Edward McGowan : Yes. So we've been instituting that now for the last several months. And as Tom talked about, we have not seen a lot of churn. We've been fairly successful in the renewals that we've had. We are still offering discounts to customers who have traffic growth. It's just not at the same levels that we've done historically. Operator : The next question is from Will Power of Baird. Charles Erlikh : It's Charlie Erlikh on for Will. Just one question for me on the pricing and contract renegotiations kind of building on your response. Any big contracts coming up for renewal that we should be aware of in the second half? And then for the 8 that you mentioned you had in the first half, any more color on just the tone and the overall discussions like pricing compression, you mentioned a little bit, but just the health of the customers you're talking to and just any more color on that would be great. Edward McGowan : Yes, sure. So there's no big ones coming up in the second half. Like I said, if we ever have a big clump in the -- we'll call it out for it. I think it's just helpful to provide commentary and get you guys aware of what's happening. In terms of the dynamics outside of pushing back a little bit on sort of the peak to average, which is part of the normal discussion that we have, I would say we're kind of came in line with what we had expected. We did try to apply our strategy of being a bit more disciplined.  I don't know if that's the right word, but more attuned to what's going on with volumes and having conversations with customers about expected volume growth, et cetera. So pleased with where we landed. And obviously, renewing large customers and this -- and the delivery segment is never a fun thing. But kind of came out as expected. And then your other question was on -- just remind me again? Charles Erlikh : I think you actually hit all the questions, yes, just the overall tone of the conversations. But yes, I think you answered it pretty well. Edward McGowan : Yes. So overall, I mean the customers are still in great shape. There are some very large brands and still very healthy. We added services to most of them. So not only are we just dealing with delivery, but we're also adding on additional capabilities as well. Operator : The next question is from Alex Henderson of Needham. Alexander Henderson : So given both Guardicore and Linode have not been in the full for over a year, I was wondering if you could look at them from the perspective of apples-to-apples, if they had been in the fold for the entire year, what their internal growth rates look like so that we have some gauge of the rate of growth at those 2 acquisitions. Edward McGowan : Yes, it's a good question, Alex. I'll take this one, Tom. So Linode, so Linode will end up being in for most of the year. But just prior to acquisition, we had said in our commentary, they're growing around 15%. Obviously, we'll accelerate that as we start to add enterprise customers. So I'd expect that to increase. With Guardicore, if you remember our first call, we're taking our guidance up quite a bit, but if you look at where our kind of internal -- where our run rate is now, we're looking at over $60 million. That would be almost a doubling of where they were when we acquired them even slightly higher than that.  So Guardicore growing extremely fast, I would say, sort of if it was a standalone on its own would be more than a double. And Linode, we just picked it up and its starting to add that functionality and expect to accelerate that growth rate, but they were about 15% prior to acquisition. Alexander Henderson : There was a comment earlier in the call that adjusting for acquisitions, the underlying growth rate was 17%. Would you confirm that, that's an accurate calculus? Edward McGowan : Yes. That's about the right math. 21% constant currency. Guardicore was about $14 million. So that's roughly 4%. So that's about right. Alexander Henderson : Perfect. And then just looking at the international markets, how are you handling the FX swings that are going on? In terms of pricing, are you offsetting and look the effective price reduction that implies in dollars, if you're in local currency and where you're not in local currency, are you pricing down to lower the burden? How are you handling the customer pressures around that? Edward McGowan : Yes. So most of the customers outside the U.S. are paying us in local currency. So they're billed in local currency. There are several that are not certain countries, for example, will be in U.S. dollar. So far, it has not been a big issue with our customers pushing back. We do some hedging on balance sheet, but not from an operational perspective, not cash flow hedging. And then in terms of pricing, we do take that into consideration as we're going through with customers that are outside the U.S. And also just in general, depending on where their traffic is, that also comes into effect. If we're delivering in countries that are more expensive, we take that into effect as well. Tom Barth : Okay. Thank you, Alex, and thank you, everyone. So in closing, we will be presenting at a number of investor conferences and events throughout the rest of the third quarter. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Thank you for joining us, and all of us here at Akamai wish continued good health to you and yours. Have a nice evening. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Akamai Technologies Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Tom Barth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on November 8, 2022. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law. As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Thomson Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered strong results in the third quarter despite the ongoing challenges with the global economic environment and the effects of a strong U.S. dollar. Q3 revenue was $882 million, up 3% year-over-year and up 7% in constant currency. This result was driven by the continued strong growth of our security and compute businesses, which collectively grew 23% year-over-year and 28% in constant currency. These 2 business lines accounted for 55% of our overall revenue in the quarter. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 28%. And non-GAAP EPS was $1.26 per diluted share, down 13% year-over-year or down 7% in constant currency. EPS was negatively impacted once again by foreign exchange rates and a higher effective tax rate compared to last year. Free cash flow was very strong at $271 million in Q3, and it amounted to 31% of our revenue. I'll now say a few words about each of our 3 main lines of business, starting with security. Our Security solutions generated revenue of $380 million in Q3, up 13% year-over-year and up 19% in constant currency. The growth was particularly strong for our enterprise Zero Trust products, which were up 51% year-over-year in constant currency. Our Guardicore Segmentation solution continued to lead the way with several major customer wins. For example, one of the largest energy companies in the world adopted Guardicore to help protect against SolarWinds types of ransomware attacks. A leading global developer of dietary supplements adopted our Segmentation solution to help meet European regulations and limit cybersecurity risk. And a major South American broadcaster deployed Guardicore to protect their reporting of election results. Our market-leading app and API protection products also performed well in Q3, with many wins against the competition. For example, the largest bank in Southeast Asia came to Akamai last quarter after suffering repeated outages by a competitor that had lured them in with low pricing. When the bank faced large fines from regulators for the extended outages, they saw more value in being back on Akamai's platform. One of the top banks in North America is in the process of bringing all of their traffic back to Akamai after struggling with outages at another competitor who would also lure them in with lower pricing, but couldn't deliver the performance and reliability needed by a major enterprise. After testing our capabilities against competitors, one of the world's largest financial services companies expanded their relationship with us, contracting for 10 of our products and services, including Bot Manager and Page Integrity Manager. A Fortune 100 food processor and commodities trader became a new Akamai customer last quarter after an anonymous threat drove them to seek better DDoS and web app protection than they were getting from a competitor. And in Germany, an online advertising business with one of the country's busiest websites suffered severe account takeover attacks, load problems and reputation damage before coming to Akamai for bot management and app and API protection. Given such examples, it's not surprising that Akamai's web app and API protection was named a leader in both Gartner's Magic Quadrant and in Forrester's Wave report last quarter. Our compute product group also performed well in Q3 with revenue of $109 million, up 72% year-over-year and up 77% in constant currency. We're continuing to make good progress on integrating Linode into our edge platform and on adding the capabilities and scale needed to support mission-critical applications for major enterprises. In particular, we've connected all of Linode's 11 existing locations into our private backbone, enabling us to provide lower latency, higher throughput and improved egress economics. We've also expanded the capacity of these facilities and are in the process of adding 13 additional sites, 5 of which are expected to go live in Q1 with 8 more planned for Q2. As we discussed at our Analyst Day in May, we're also developing a lighter-weight deployment model that is suitable for distribution at a broad scale. This will enable us to get compute much closer to end users around the world. We plan to deploy several dozen of these lighter-weight sites next year, at which point we expect to compare well with the hyperscalers in terms of points of presence and proximity to both enterprise data centers and end users. Of course, we plan to have all of our compute sites integrated into Akamai's unique edge platform, which has over 4,000 locations for edge computing. As a result, we expect to be able to offer superior performance as well as lower total cost of ownership for enterprise computing needs. We've also made significant progress on adding new and improved enterprise capabilities to our compute platform. We launched Database-as-a-Service with managed MySQL in May and managed Postgres in June. We released the next generation of our Kubernetes platform in Q3 to enhance performance and reliability. We expect to launch early versions of an enhanced object storage product as well as next-gen serverless capabilities next quarter. And we expect to become SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliant this quarter with PCI compliance expected to follow in the first half of 2023. Although we still have much work to do, we're encouraged by the customer use cases that our compute platform began serving in Q3. One of the world's top development studios for gaming moved their matchmaking service to Akamai to help them with data processing and analysis. A large online legal services platform in India chose Akamai as part of their multi-cloud strategy after they concluded that we could help them optimize their cloud computing budget. And a large media workflow company in Germany is planning to migrate their apps from a hyperscaler to Akamai, calling our new capabilities a great addition, especially with the plans for a high number of distributed sites and the tight integration with Akamai content delivery. Over the past few months, I've spoken with many of the world's leading enterprises about our plans for cloud computing. Most tell me that they want more choice in cloud computing, and they often express concern about being locked into contracts with cloud giants that are consuming larger portions of their IT budgets, especially in cases when their cloud vendor is also a direct competitor. Customers also understand the value of leveraging a more widely distributed cloud platform and one that directly connects to Akamai's unique edge platform with over 4,000 points of presence. Turning now to our CDN business. Our delivery products generated revenue of $393 million in Q3, down 15% year-over-year and down 11% in constant currency. These results reflect continued deceleration in traffic growth among our largest customers and the impact of some large renewals that we completed in the first half of the year. As we said at our Analyst Day in May, we've aligned our pricing strategy with the slower traffic growth rates we've experienced this year. In addition to scaling back discounts upon renewal, we're continuing to decline business from a very small number of customers who have extreme traffic peaks compared to their daily usage patterns. While this resulted in less revenue in Q3, it's enabled us to meaningfully lower our delivery network CapEx as we direct cash flow from our delivery business to our compute and security businesses where we have a higher ROI. As Ed will detail shortly, we're also taking several steps to reduce OpEx, including reducing our real estate footprint and limiting hiring to our most critical areas. Although we're facing the same challenging macroeconomic environment as other companies, I believe that Akamai is on the right path to long-term growth and success with our disciplined management of expenses and strong focus on opportunities for future growth such as cloud computing. Becoming a force in the enormous cloud computing market won't be easy, but I believe that it's something that Akamai can accomplish. Akamai has a strong track record of continuous innovation and business expansion. Along the way, we've achieved significant milestones that many thought were impossible. In our first decade, we pioneered the CDN industry. a multibillion dollar market, where we remain the leader by far. In our second decade, we created the industry for app and API protection as a cloud service, our second multibillion dollar market, where we are the leader by a wide margin. Looking ahead, Akamai is on the cusp of another major phase of expansion with our foray into cloud computing. Having already scaled content delivery and cloud security into billion dollar businesses, we now have an opportunity to do it again with cloud computing. In fact, I believe our opportunity in cloud computing is even larger than it's been for delivery and security. Cloud computing is a $100 billion market growing at a very rapid rate. We believe we're in an excellent position to capture a share of this business, particularly from companies that value our market-leading delivery and security solutions and that don't want to be locked in to more expensive options with a cloud giant that competes against them. Akamai is a company that enterprises can trust to be their partner, to scale with their business and to provide the best when it comes to security, reliability and performance. By adding compute to our unique edge platform, we can provide a full suite of cloud services that will help lower our customers' cost to build, run, deliver and secure their applications. In summary, my confidence in Akamai's future prospects for growth and success has never been higher. In fact, my confidence in what I see ahead for Akamai has led me to take steps to put in place a 10b5-1 trading plan, not to sell, but to buy $3 million in Akamai stock over the next 6 months. We expect to announce the adoption of my plan in a formal filing later this week. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on Q3 and our outlook. Ed? Edward McGowan : Thank you, Tom. As Tom mentioned, Akamai delivered a solid quarter in Q3 despite a very challenging macroeconomic environment. Q3 revenue was $882 million, up 3% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. The stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted our year-over-year growth rate by approximately 4 points or about $39 million of revenue year-over-year and $14 million on a sequential basis. On a combined basis, our security and compute businesses represented 55% of total revenue, up 23% year-over-year and 28% in constant currency. Security revenue was $380 million and grew 13% year-over-year and 19% in constant currency, led by another strong contribution from Guardicore. Guardicore delivered approximately $14 million of revenue in Q3. Security represented 43% of total revenue in Q3, which is up 4 points from Q3 a year ago. Compute revenue was $109 million in Q3, up 72% year-over-year and 77% in constant currency. As Tom mentioned, while we are in the early innings of our cloud computing journey, we are very excited about initial feedback from customers and the significant growth opportunity ahead. Delivery revenue was $393 million, down 15% year-over-year and down 11% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets were $421 million and represented 48% of total revenue in Q3, up 1 point from Q2. International revenue was up 2% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $461 million, up 3% year-over-year. Moving now to costs and profitability. Cash gross margin was 75%. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 61%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $291 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $368 million, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 42%. Non-GAAP operating income was $243 million, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 28%. It is worth noting that on a year-over-year basis, our non-GAAP operating margin was negatively impacted by approximately 1 point due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $111 million. As we mentioned on our Q2 earnings call, our strategy in our delivery business is to be more selective on the peak traffic levels we will take on our network. As a result, delivery network CapEx, excluding Linode, was just under 4% of revenue in Q3. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $108 million or $0.68 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $200 million or $1.26 of earnings per diluted share, down 13% year-over-year and down 7% in constant currency. It's worth noting that on a year-over-year basis, foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.10 in Q3. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $41 million based on a Q3 effective tax rate of approximately 17%. This was about 1 point higher than our guidance due to a more unfavorable mix between U.S. and foreign earnings. Now moving to cash and our use of capital. As of September 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.4 billion. During the third quarter, we spent approximately $163 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 1.8 million shares. Our ongoing share repurchase activity has resulted in a net reduction in our non-GAAP fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 5 million shares or roughly 3% on a year-over-year basis. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.4 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Our intention is to continue to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases. Before I provide our Q4 outlook and an update to our 2022 guidance, I want to highlight several factors. First, with nearly half of our revenue coming from outside the U.S., the strong U.S. dollar continues to be a significant headwind to our reported results. At current spot rates, our guidance now assumes foreign exchange will have a negative $130 million impact to revenue in 2022 on a year-over-year basis. As I mentioned previously, the strong dollar also impacts our margins and earnings. We estimate FX will negatively impact our non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 1 point year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings by approximately $0.34 for the full year 2022. Second, we have seen a lengthening in some of our sales cycles. We believe that is -- this primarily reflects the uncertain macroeconomic conditions that our customers are experiencing, and it is visible in many parts of our business. Finally, we continue to closely monitor our costs in light of ongoing inflationary and macroeconomic pressures across the globe. We have made good initial progress on our cost-cutting measures that we mentioned on our last call, which include real estate costs, where we sublease some of our underutilized office space in Q3, and we'll continue to look for additional savings going forward. Reducing our third-party cloud expense in 2023, where we look forward to making significant progress on shifting workloads to Linode. And lowering network CapEx associated with our delivery business, where I noted our continued progress on reducing spend significantly related to traffic delivery. In addition to these items, as Tom mentioned, we plan to be very disciplined with headcount and focus our investments on higher growth areas like cloud computing and security. In particular, we are closing over 500 open positions and re-tasking many other employees to work on compute. These closures went into effect today. And just a quick reminder about our typical fourth quarter dynamics before I turn to our Q4 guidance. As in prior years, seasonality plays a large role in determining our fourth quarter financial performance. We typically see higher-than-normal traffic for our large media customers and from seasonal online retail activity from our e-commerce customers, which are both difficult to predict, especially during this more challenging macroeconomic environment. With that in mind, we are projecting Q4 revenue in the range of $890 million to $915 million or down 2% to up 1% as reported or up 3% to 6% in constant currency over Q4 2021. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $11 million impact on Q4 revenue compared to Q3 levels and a negative $44 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 74%. This roughly 1 point sequential decline is primarily driven by increased third-party cloud costs and some compute-related data center build-out costs. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $298 million to $306 million. We anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of approximately 40% to 41%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $125 million to $126 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 27% for Q4. Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $122 million to $127 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the fourth quarter. This represents approximately 14% of projected total revenue. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.23 to $1.30. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $38 million to $40 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 16%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 158 million shares. And finally, for the full year 2022, we now expect revenue of $3.58 billion to $3.6 billion, which is up 3% to 4% year-over-year as reported or up 7% to 8% in constant currency. We continue to expect security growth of approximately 20% in constant currency for the full year 2022. We now estimate non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 28% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.23 to $5.30. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 16.5%, a fully diluted share count of approximately 116 million shares. Finally, full year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 13% of revenue. In closing, we are very pleased with how the business is continuing to perform despite a very challenging macroeconomic backdrop. We are very excited about our future growth opportunities ahead. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Nice quarter in a difficult environment. On that difficult environment point, I was hoping you could help with a little bit more specificity in terms of where you guys are seeing the macro impacts. It sounds like security is still holding up relatively well. And on the delivery side of the equation, there's some Akamai-specific impacts there. Could you give us some kind of detail in terms of where the risk factors are, sort of where the macro lies on a product and geographic perspective? I think that would be helpful. And then I guess on the CapEx side of the equation, you talked a little bit about types of business that you guys are not looking to take onboard on a go-forward basis, the very peaky workloads that perhaps were overly taxed in the system, if you will. Can that lead to a fundamental different kind of CapEx intensity for the business on a go-forward basis? Or is it just too small to make a difference? Edward McGowan : Keith, this is Ed. I'll take those. I'll start with the second question first. So from a CapEx perspective, the way to think about it is in the delivery business, we had -- if you go back to our May Analyst Day, we talked about CapEx and delivery being in sort of the high single digits. We've been running in the lower single digits. We're just under 4%. So certainly, in the near term, it will have an impact in the delivery business. As the compute business gets larger, obviously, that's going to be the main driver for CapEx. But certainly, you saw that in Q3, the impact of overall CapEx down at around 13%, and for the year, it's around 13%. So it is less capital-intensive. But as we look at our cloud compute business, obviously, there's going to be some -- Tom talked about building out in more locations. So there'll be some more CapEx associated with that. But we are seeing a pretty healthy decline in our delivery business, which is as anticipated. On your first question, you asked about the macroeconomic environment where we're seeing some challenges. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are seeing some of our sales cycles lengthening, seeing customers pushing off upgrades for certain products and things like that, which is pretty typical. Most companies are doing that. I know we're -- we're doing something similar as we go through our budget cycles. We think it's temporary in nature. Also seeing a little bit of pressure in some of the advertising-related businesses, a little bit of pressure there. And then Europe is something that we're keeping a pretty close eye on, that's about geographically where we're worried. Obviously, with what's going on with energy costs and things like that in Europe, that's something that we're keeping a very close eye on and have been a little bit cautious on our guidance, I would say, in Q4, just relative to seasonality. Just trying to take that into consideration. Keith Weiss : Got it. And on the energy cost, is that a top line concern in terms of you're worried about your -- what your customers are experiencing? Or is that more of a gross margin concern that you guys are worried that those energy costs can impact your gross margins on a go-forward basis? Edward McGowan : Yes, I'd say it's more on our customers and their customers, so how does the consumer behave. Obviously, retail is a driver of seasonality as is spending for media. So those 2 things could be impacted. And then obviously, with our customers, if you see shutdown in manufacturing and things like that, that's obviously going to have a ripple effect on GDP across Europe. So that's from that perspective. As far as our risk with energy, we do a pretty good job. The team has done a nice job with our colo negotiations. If you think about our costs, our server costs were pretty insulated from costs there on the bandwidth side that tends to be deflationary. Colo, there is some energy exposure, but the team has done a really good job of trying to lock in longer-term deals. We're not seeing that. It's possible that may start to affect us later into next year. But right now, we've got it pretty well under control. Operator : And our next question today comes from James Breen at William Blair. James Breen : Can you just talk a little bit about the compute business? I recognize it was up a lot year-over-year after you closed Linode. It was up a few million quarter-to-quarter. What do you have to do to accelerate that business? Is it building out more resources? Is it just you're getting some larger customers? And sort of what are the thoughts there on what that could ultimately grow? It seems like with the opportunity, it could grow faster than the security business. Thomson Leighton : Yes. Great question. The compute business, even before Linode, was on a pretty strong trajectory of growth. And with Linode, that accelerates it a lot. As you look to the future, the big growth comes when we're tapping into the core cloud compute market, a market that's over $100 billion today and growing rapidly. And that's something that we're working really hard on now to -- so we can exploit that next year. And that involves increasing scale, having a lot more core compute regions and then introducing the lighter-weight distributed computing regions. So that we'll be in a position to offer at least as good or better performance integration into the Akamai platform, which has great delivery, great security and, of course, edge computing at a lower total cost of ownership. And for a lot of our customers, especially you think of the media vertical and the commerce vertical, they spend a lot more on compute than they do with delivery and security. Moreover, they compete pretty heavily with the hyperscalers. So the big growth for us, what we're really going after over the next several years is in that core cloud compute market, mission-critical applications for major enterprises because that's a very big potential market for us. And that's what will drive our -- the major growth in compute, and ultimately, I think the company going forward. Operator : And our next question today comes from James Fish at Piper Sandler. James Fish : I appreciate the questions. Obviously, I agree with you on deceleration in traffic overall, especially on the media side. But what makes you guys confident that you aren't losing traffic share of some of the media customers, especially as you're purposely not doing some of these large events, for example, or kind of the gaming peak traffic? And any sense to how much that's kind of impacting the media business this quarter in this year overall that we should kind of normalize as we start to think about for next year? Edward McGowan : Jim, this is Ed. Good question. So actually with traffic, we are starting to see a little bit of a recovery in September. It continued a bit in October as well. But in general, it is, as we talked about, a much lower year relative to what we typically see. As far as the specific customers, you're talking about only a handful of big customers that can drive this kind of peak. And these particular customers all have multi-CDN. So in this particular case, we did lose a couple of million dollars. It's not significant in terms of the impact on the year. But as you can see, it saved us about, call it, 4 points on CapEx. So it's pretty meaningful from an overall economic standpoint. Now that said, we still -- these still are big -- very big customers of ours. They've just sort of flattened out the peak a bit. So as their daily average traffic is not growing as quickly, the economics just don't work for us anymore. So we just -- they're still good customers of ours, but just decided we weren't going to allow them to peak as much as they did in the past. It just makes sense for us. But it's not an overly material number. A few million dollars is the way to think about it. James Fish : That's helpful. I appreciate that. Maybe following up a little bit on Keith's prior question around more specifically on the security growth, which slowed to about 15% when I normalize everything. What makes you guys confident that we're going to see an acceleration of this business back to that 20% all-in constant currency growth rate over the next couple of years? And is the impact today being more felt on the new business side, given kind of your comments along elongating sales cycles? Or is it you're seeing a slowdown in existing customers' expansion as well? Thomson Leighton : Yes. Good question. The 20% goal, of course, includes M&A, and we're about to do the year-over-year lapping on Guardicore, which is a very successful acquisition. And we haven't announced any other acquisitions in security to sort of fill that gap. In terms of increasing the security growth rate over time, obviously, the global economic conditions are important there. Also, we've got several of the newer products that are growing very rapidly. Aside from Guardicore, bot management doing extremely well. The new Account Protector solution doing very well. Page integrity management, which will be, I think, really important for companies that want to be PCI compliant beginning in 2025, and they're already working towards that. Those areas are doing very well in terms of growth, but they're still small enough in revenue that they can't swing the whole number as much. The vast majority of our security revenue today is in the app and the API protection area. And the large majority of that is in our web app firewall, where we're the market leader by far and continuing to grow that faster than the market and our competitors there. But that market is -- as a whole, is slower growing. So what we'll need to see is better economic environment, continued growth in the rapidly growing products that are -- as they get bigger, their rapid growth can drive security as a whole, and ultimately, M&A, which is a key part of the 20% goal. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Frank Louthan at Raymond James. Frank Louthan : Great. With the sales cycle more elongated, can you give us a little more detail there? Is that across the board? Is it concentrated in any verticals? And give us a little bit more color on what's driving that. Is it more economic? Or is there anything to do with the mix with Linode and compute that's sort of making the suite of services take a little longer for folks to make a decision? Edward McGowan : Frank, good question. So actually, I'll start with Linode. Actually, Linode in an environment like this, given what Tom talked about, we will be able to provide comparable services at a much better set of economics and actually think is an opportunity for us. So I would expect that as we go into next year, that should be a tailwind for us. On the headwind side, we are seeing across the board, certainly from a geographic perspective, that sales cycles are elongating. We've seen some deals push. Probably the easiest place to identify it is in Guardicore. Guardicore, as Tom mentioned, is still doing really well, but we have a dedicated sales team. So it's a little bit easier to track those deals as they're going through the pipeline. Those deals also sometimes tend to be a little bit larger. So it's a little bit easier to follow that. With our business, given it's a SaaS business and we've got recurring revenue contracts are constantly going through and renewing contracts, what you're seeing is some customers that are talking about, say, adding Page Integrity Manager or a Bot Manager or Account Protector, just pushing that off into the future as they go through their budget cycle. So we're not seeing as much on the renewal side from an upgrade perspective. So a little bit of slowness there. And then from the new customer acquisition perspective, I think pretty much every tech company you talk to these days is seeing it a little bit harder to attract new customers. So it's a little bit of a combination of everything as we've just been impacted by this economic impact here. Operator : And our next question today comes from Fatima Boolani with Citigroup. Unidentified Analyst : This is on for Fatima. So just maybe a follow-up in regards to the September and October recovery on the delivery side you're starting to see. Can you maybe give a sense of which end market cohort is really driving that momentum? And then when you're going to negotiating tables in regards to pricing and other contract terms, can you also give us a sense of how that has been developing? Edward McGowan : Sure. Yes. So in terms of the traffic sort of getting a little bit healthier, I would say, coming out of the summer months, media is probably the vertical that it's most obvious in. So we're starting to see that across video, a little bit in gaming. Gaming is still overall very, very weak compared to what it's been in the future, but a little bit of an uptick here in the gaming vertical over the last couple of months. And then your other question, can you just remind me again? I forget. Unidentified Analyst : Sorry, just in terms of pricing and other contract terms as you guys go to the negotiation table. Edward McGowan : Yes. So one of the things we talked about is, obviously, like in the media division in particular, media verticals in particular, as we see traffic levels decline or not grow as quickly, I should say, we typically would give a discount commensurate with what you see in the traffic growth rate. So obviously, as traffic growth rates are not growing as quickly, we are lowering our discounts that we're providing to our customers, and we're starting to see that make its way through the system. It will take a while for it to really impact the growth as we go through our renewal cycles, but I am seeing that the pricing declines are certainly moderating a bit. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Got it. And then maybe just a follow-on, on the lighter-weight development. Any sense of how the customers -- are there any #1 customers in the beta testing phase? And also, I guess, where -- what are sort of the milestones we should look out there -- look out for there? Thomson Leighton : I didn't catch the question. Can you repeat the question, please? Unidentified Analyst : Sorry, just in terms of the lighter-weight deployment on, I guess, the cloud side? Yes. Thomson Leighton : Yes. And what's the question about the lighter-weight deployment? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Just in terms of, are there any customers currently in the beta phase or testing out the product and how has that feedback been? And then are there any milestones we should look out for? Thomson Leighton : Good. Okay. So there are customers on the platform today and a key reason that they are using Linode and plan to grow their use of Linode is because of these deployments. And the advantage of the lighter-weight deployments is we can get into markets, into regions where it's hard to build out a massive core compute data center so that we're going to have before -- next year more than double by having over a couple of dozen of the core compute data centers, but several dozen more of these lighter-weight distributed locations, where you can do the compute. You wouldn't have huge monolithic storage there, but you don't need that. That can be in the core regions. And that is a key consideration to some of our larger customers that are working with Linode today, doing proofs-of-concept, so in some cases, already running mission-critical applications. Because those lighter weight regions being closer to enterprise data centers in many parts of the world and to end users gives you better performance. And I think that will put Akamai in a great position to have equal or better performance than the hyperscalers. Of course, we have already our edge deployment with 4,000 locations, which also supports edge computing on top of delivery. And for a total -- lower total cost of ownership. So yes, the lightweight distributed regions are important for a lot of our customers and prospects with among the major enterprises on Linode. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Elias at Cowen and Company. Michael Elias : The first one, you mentioned it a bit ago relating to your long-term guidance and M&A on the security front. Just a question around how would you describe the pipeline of opportunities for M&A in the security market? And as part of that, maybe any capabilities which are top of mind as you think about adding to the platform? Thomson Leighton : Yes, we have a large pipeline, and we generally do. We're constantly looking for appropriate acquisitions. As Ed said, we're very disciplined buyers, though. And the market as a whole is still highly priced. I think the realities of what's going on in the global economy haven't fully set in yet. That may take another year. And so because we're very careful buyers, we're being very selective there. I think there's a variety of capabilities that would be interesting as tech tuck-ins. And occasionally, we'll make an acquisition with a product adjacency. I think Guardicore has been a fabulous acquisition. They're the market leaders now in segmentation, making Akamai the market leader there. And I think that's the most important defense an enterprise can have. You can buy every company's Zero Trust offer, and malware is still getting into enterprises. And the real key is to identify it quickly and proactively block it from spreading. And that's how you limit the damage caused by ransomware and data exfiltration attacks. And that's what Guardicore does. And so I think very important strategic product with enterprise security and Zero Trust. But over time, I think there'll be other capabilities that we'll be interested in, in terms of broadening the portfolio. Michael Elias : Got it. Now just a philosophical question for you, Tom. Over the years, you've taken steps to continue to grow the business and expand Akamai into new verticals. But the stock really hasn't responded in the way that I think you would have liked, just given some of your prior comments. My question for you is, as you think about executing the long-term vision for Akamai, do you believe being a public company is the right setting for you to achieve that long-term vision? Thomson Leighton : Yes, sure. I think it's great being a public company. And yes, I do think the stock is undervalued where we are today in this market. And that's why I'm going to buy more shares. It's -- and over time, the stock has grown. And I think there's excellent prospects for future growth as we continue to grow Akamai. And I'm really excited about what we can do in the compute landscape. That's an enormous market. You just look at Akamai, next year, probably security will be our biggest product line. That's a big step forward, given that we started as a CDN company. And I think if you look 3 to 5 years down the road, well, maybe in that time frame, compute could be our largest product line. So I think there's lots of opportunity for continued growth. We're very disciplined when it comes to cost, and that means there's a lot of opportunity for bottom line growth in earnings per share. We've continued to buy back our equity to reduce the number of shares outstanding. So I think there's a great value proposition for public Akamai shareholders. Operator : And our next question today comes from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Tim Horan : I hate to harp on it, but the sales slowdown, can you just give us a little more color maybe when you started to see it? Is it continuing? Maybe what the lag is in terms of sales and revenue showing up? Just I'm trying to get a sense of what next year's revenue growth could be. I guess, at a high level, are we looking at 2 or 3 more quarters of flat from what we know now? Or at a high level, can growth be better next year than this year at this point? Edward McGowan : Jim, let me take a stab at that. So I would say we started to see it really in this quarter and continue -- sorry, this quarter, meaning Q3, sorry, we're reporting Q3, continuing here in Q4. Hard to say how long this economic slowdown lasts. Now keep in mind, most of our business is under contract. The impact of the new signings doesn't have an overly material impact on the business, especially in any one given quarter. Obviously, over a prolonged period of time, it can slow growth down a bit. I think the bigger thing to think about as you build your models is the impact that foreign exchange has had. I've been trying to call it out as we go. Obviously, the dollar has gotten stronger throughout the year. So when you think about from an as-reported perspective, that's going to be a pretty big headwind. If you annualized at a point we went back all the way to the beginning of the year, you're talking a couple of hundred million dollars of revenue or $0.40 of EPS, a couple of points of operating margin. But that's a much bigger issue in terms of growth. And given our strong growth internationally, FX, assuming the dollar continues to get stronger, is something that I'd be more concerned about from a growth perspective. But we'll give you an update on guidance next year when we have our Q1 call -- or excuse me, our Q4 earnings call in Q1. So I'm not going to provide any guidance right now, but hopefully that gives you enough color to think about it. Tim Horan : On FX, some of your largest competitors, particularly in cloud, but even on the kind of CDN security space, people had a bundling kind of charge in dollars pretty regularly. And some of your other smaller, one in main competitors in Linode has raised prices quite a bit here lately. Have you thought about maybe switching over the pricing in dollars? Or do you do much of that? And have you taken any pricing steps to increase prices? Edward McGowan : Yes. So we tend to price most of our -- not all of our international business is in the local currency, most of it is, though. So you can see that's why we have such a big impact. Generally speaking, it's hard to switch with a customer who has been paying in one currency and then switching to another one.  Then you also -- the -- in terms of price increases, too, that's not something that we're considering at this point. Obviously, it's kind of a risky thing to do, when you see companies raise prices. Part of the reason we're actively looking to move our cloud spend is for the reason that we're seeing the suppliers in that area either increase price or not give any commensurate declines with volume increases. So I think the long-term strategy of introducing price increases can come back and backfire on you. So we're not planning on -- we're not going to be making any changes in terms of changing customers out from paying in local currency to dollars. Tim Horan : In the U.K., you're 20% below your peers in the last 9 months of price reduction effectively. But my last question is, Linode, is your OpEx and CapEx run rate enough to transition Linode and grow Linode? Edward McGowan : Yes. So if you think about where the investments are going to be, and that's where we're primarily investing our headcount is in Linode and also in security. And Tom also mentioned that we'll be moving some of the people that have skills that are transferable. If you think about building out, scaling up a CDN, there's a lot of transferable skills. So we'll be able to move some folks that have talent into that group as well. So that won't put any pressure on the bottom line, but we will be spending some money and continuing to grow because we think the opportunity is significant. And then on a CapEx perspective, we will be building out to take in the consideration, moving our own workloads as well as the future demand, and we'll give you an update on that at the next call. Operator : And the next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I have two as well. I guess maybe on the first one, if you could just talk about the edge business, the Linode asset. And I guess, maybe the question I struggled with a fair bit is, can you grow this business on the cloud infrastructure side without sacrificing operating margins over the next several years? Or is that growth in Linode on the edge side going to come at lower margins inherently? Edward McGowan : Yes. So good question. I think we bring some pretty interesting synergy. I just mentioned on the last question how we've got a lot of skill sets in-house that can do, say, network build-outs, for example. We don't have to build out a separate team to do network build-outs. We've got engineering talent in-house. We also have a big enterprise sales force in place that Tom talked earlier in one of the earlier questions about the spending of some of our larger verticals and the relationships we have with those customers who are spending probably 10 to 15x more on cloud computing than they are on CDN. So there's a significant synergy that you get there. And then also with our network infrastructure that we have built out, Tom talked about connecting our backbone to the existing Linode centers. That drives a significant cost benefit. So I think that actually, we could have very attractive operating margins, similar to what I showed on the IR Day. We get pretty good operating leverage, just like we did with the security business. So long term, our goal is to get back to 30% or higher in operating margin. And I think as we scale that business, we should be able to do it. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then, I guess, maybe I'd just stick to that theme around Linode. Are there certain use cases that make Linode more attractive more so the top 3 cloud providers that are out there? I guess I'd just love to understand, when you folks walk into a customer pitch, what are the reasons want to use Linode versus some of the peers that might provide a cloud solution at least cheaper? Maybe that would be really helpful. Like what are the 2, 3 reasons that you think stands out? Thomson Leighton : Yes. Let me answer that question in the context of where we'll be next year. Because as you know, we're doing a lot of the build-out now. We're doing -- adding a lot of the functionality now. But if you look at where we'll be this time next year, I think, first, our footprint will be better than that of the hyperscalers. We'll be closer to a lot more enterprise data centers' end users. So that means better performance. I think we'll be hooked in now then to the Akamai platform with 4,000 POPs to do delivery, to do the outer layer of security, to do edge computing. So that's a big advantage. As Ed noted, that also lowers our costs substantially for egress. And so lower total cost of ownership is another, I think, very attractive feature that Akamai would have. Akamai is known for scalability, for reliability in addition. And there's been some pretty well-publicized issues with some of the hyperscalers in terms of reliability, extended issues. And I think that's an area where we can be very competitive. Really the only area where we wouldn't be as competitive as in the large number of third-party apps in the ecosystem that are available as managed services on the hyperscalers. And that's a key way that you get vendor lock-in. And so customers that want -- enterprises that want to have that, fine, okay? But if you don't want lock-in and you do want better performance at a lower cost, I think Akamai will be very competitive. And also, it's good to keep in mind just relative scale. Those hyperscalers are giant companies. If we can go get 1%, 2% market share in a multi-hundred billion dollar business, that will be very meaningful for us. And I think we're in a position that we can go do that. One other issue is that in the sectors where we're very strong like media and commerce, those companies, they compete heavily with at least some of the hyperscalers. And with the cost of the hyperscalers rising, that's becoming more of an issue for those companies. You're paying a large bill to a company that's buying out the media rights from underneath you. And that's sort of tough for some of them to take. So I think that also gives us a competitive advantage. We don't compete with our customers. We will help them grow with their business and be good partners to them and they can trust us. Operator : And our next question today comes from Mark Murphy at JPMorgan. Sonak Kolar : Sonak Kolar here on for Mark Murphy. Tom, can you get a bit deeper on the new pricing strategy, particularly around delivery? Have you noted any incremental changes in customer retention or churn levels as a result of some of these pricing adjustments, specifically around some of the inflationary environment pressures driving price sensitivity in the market? Edward McGowan : Yes. This is Ed. No, we haven't seen anything notable. Like if anything, we're actually starting, like I said, to see some bit of a moderation in the pricing declines. So we haven't seen anything on the churn side. Sonak Kolar : Got it. That's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up. Would you say some of the macro pressures that you've called out have intensified in Q3 relative to Q2? Or has it remained fairly in line with some of the pressures that you called out during the last earnings call? Edward McGowan : Yes, I'd say it's intensified a bit in Q3. Operator : And our next question today comes from Rudy Kessinger with D.A. Davidson. Rudy Kessinger : I don't want to belabor the point on security growth. But again, when we exclude Guardicore and look at it at constant currency, it looks like organic has come down about 5 points from Q1 to Q3. And so if you were to look at it, could you maybe break out like what's been the impact in your assessment from the macro and -- versus just maybe some of the larger products maturing and growing slower that's led to that roughly 5-point deceleration in the last couple of quarters? Edward McGowan : Yes, I'd say it's a tough one to really figure out what the impact is on the macro. I'd say that's probably -- maybe that's a point or 2. But I think it's really the issue of what Tom talked about, where if you look at the biggest product, we're the market leader in web app firewalls growing faster than the market, but that market isn't growing as fast as some of the other markets that we're in, and it's just not at scale yet. So I'd say that's the bigger issue, except those newer products are growing faster at the scale that we're at, just isn't offsetting the slower growth in those -- in the bigger products. Rudy Kessinger : Okay. And then on Linode, I don't know if you gave it. Could you share how much revenue Linode did in the quarter? And then last quarter, given the commentary today about the increase in cost of the hyperscalers, last quarter, you talked about moving your hyperscaler spend over to Linode internally. Have you started that process yet? And if not, when do you plan to do so? Edward McGowan : Yes, I'll take the first one. Thomson Leighton : Go ahead, Ed. You take the first part and I'll... Edward McGowan : I'll do -- mine is pretty simple. So Linode added about $33 million this quarter. Tom, why don't you talk about the movement? Thomson Leighton : Yes. So that's well -- the migration of our cloud spend to Linode is well underway. We've already done some. The lion's share of that work or the migration will take place, I would say, over Q1 to Q3 next year. And by the end of next year, we ought to have the vast, vast majority migrated. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Tom Blakey with Truist Securities. Tom Blakey : I think it's been touched on a couple of times by my peers here. Just wanted to get -- go back to that. Some sort of normalized CapEx level, from my estimation, we're clearly overspending on Linode as a percentage of Linode revenue, anyway, right, if you do the percentage of total revenue. And you've made great strides in terms of lowering the CapEx from a delivery perspective down to this kind of 3% to 4% range. But as things kind of normalize, Tom, when you look out, and we're at , maybe 2/3 of revenue coming from compute security, CapEx is nil. You're just riding the rails of what already exists. What does the CapEx kind of bridge or normalized structure of this company look like a few years from now? Edward McGowan : Yes. So I'll take a stab at that. Tom, if you want to add anything, feel free to jump in. So obviously, with the -- what we're talking about here, where Linode was primarily focused on small, medium business, and we're moving towards the enterprise workloads, you're talking about much larger workloads. Even with our own spend and what we're moving, Tom talked about on the last call, we had that we're spending roughly $100 million, that's growing pretty fast. That's a much bigger scale than what Linode was doing. So looking at CapEx as a percentage of existing Linode business isn't the right metric to look at, at this point. But think of it as we're in the build phase. So you can see CapEx is starting to creep up a bit as we're building out, as we see better visibility into demand and also as we start to build out our plans to migrate the workloads that we do have on the hyperscalers on to us. So you're going to see a bit of a disjoint. So if you're looking at that as a metric, it doesn't send the right signal. I'd say look at that as more of a bullish signal in terms of how we feel about our customer -- pending customer demand and also how we think we'll be very successful in being able to migrate those workloads. So for the next, say, several quarters, you're going to see more CapEx going into Linode and then the revenue and the cost savings will follow. But then if we get -- it really depends on the growth, right? So as you're growing revenue at significant rates, and so you're doubling revenue, you're going to obviously have a higher percentage of CapEx. But then at some point, it will normalize out to approximate what the future revenue growth would be. And so, let's say, for example, we get to 20% growth as a run rate in the long term, your CapEx will probably be somewhere in that range. Tom Blakey : I'm sorry, I didn't understand the last comment of 20% growth in Linode, the CapEx was... Edward McGowan : No, no, no. So I was using that as an example. What I was saying is we'll give you detailed guidance on what we're going to do next year, but we're in a building phase now where Tom talked about getting into many new centers we're building out for our own demand and also what we're hearing from our customers. So what I was saying is if you're looking at CapEx as a percentage of Linode, it's not the right way to be thinking about it because we're going after a much different business, right? We're going after big enterprise workloads. So there's a build phase where you have to build out ahead of the demand. And then you'll start to see the revenue come our way. And as you get to scale, like many years out when you get to scale, you can start thinking about as a proxy that roughly speaking, your CapEx would approximate what your future demand is. So if you, say, have a long-term run rate of 20% or 30%, your CapEx will be somewhere in that range. But in the near term, it'll be higher than... Tom Blakey : That's exactly what I was asking. I understand, obviously, you're overspending today. And that comment was just a structural comment for the question on what CapEx would be as a total percentage of revenue, total revenue in the -- again, when you're at scale for Linode? Will it be structurally lower or higher than delivery? Edward McGowan : We'll know when we get there. There'll probably be -- certainly higher than what we're seeing in delivery now, but it is a more capital-intensive business by nature. Tom Blakey : It's a more capital-intensive business with compute, okay. Operator : And our next question today comes from Will Power at Baird. Charles Erlikh : This is Charlie Erlikh on for Will. I just wanted to ask a 2-parter on the comment that you guys are going to basically take some resources from delivery and put them into security and compute headcount-wise and hiring-wise. So the first part is, how do you feel about competition for talent in the security business and the compute business maybe relative to a few months ago? Kind of what does that hiring environment look like in those 2 businesses? And then part 2 on the delivery side, how should we interpret that comment as far as trying to turn around that delivery business and just sort of what should we expect from that business as far as trends going forward? Thomson Leighton : I'll take the first question. It's still a competitive market for hiring. We've been very pleased to see our attrition rates take a major drop over the last quarter. We had stayed at low attrition rates through COVID, well better than market, ticked up a little bit in the first half of the year, but now again down to, over the last 3 months, very low attrition. We have very successful recruiting. Akamai is considered to be a great place to work as measured by the various studies that are done and also employee satisfaction surveys that we do. So people really like working at Akamai. We have really great employees, very smart. We set a high bar for who we recruit. And of course, everybody wants to hire those people. And pretty much everybody wants to hire Akamai employees. But our retention rates are good. I would say our success in hiring is good, but it's a competitive market out there. And Ed, do you want to talk about the delivery business? Edward McGowan : Yes, sure. So the way to think about the delivery business, I'll call on 4 factors in terms of thinking about, as you called it, a turnaround. Obviously, one is renewal. So we went through a very heavy phase of renewals. So we're not going to have that next year. We'll always have some renewals, but it's very unusual to see 8 of your top 10 customers renewing at the same time. Number two is pricing. So we're -- as we talked about several times on the call, we are moderating the discounts that we provide on pricing. And then the third thing is traffic. Traffic, we're starting to see some encouraging signs, albeit early, that the Internet has been growing at 30% a year for many, many years. This year is a sub-30% year, but it's reasonable to think that we should start to get back to more traditional growth rates. And then the fourth thing I would say is I think we get a tailwind in our delivery business from being in the compute space. We actually do see some customers that are on hyperscalers get to a certain size that they -- even though they offer their own CDNs, come to us for better performance. So as we add customers, get into new verticals, et cetera, we do have the opportunity to just grow the delivery business by being a proxy of being in the compute business. Operator : And our final question today comes from Alex Henderson at Needham & Company. Alexander Henderson : Sliding in before the final. Nice. So I wanted to go back to the commentary that you've made about the outlook for the upcoming quarter, particularly in the security space. If I adjust the numbers for the contribution from the acquisition of Guardicore, I'm getting an as-reported growth rate of around 9%. And I'm wondering, given your commentary about more difficult conditions and a little larger currency translation year-over-year in the fourth quarter, whether in fact you're expecting the security business to slow to that level in your guidance? Edward McGowan : Yes. Alex, this is Ed here. I'll give that one a try. Obviously, we don't break out specific guidance for individual products like that in the quarter. But right now, the FX impact, as you quoted an as-reported number, is about 6%. So as-reported was 13%, constant currency was 19%. So if you assume that, you're getting to about -- if you're using 9%, you get to about 15%. Since we're lapping, in constant currency that is -- since you're lapping the Guardicore acquisition at this point, and we just came off a 15% organic growth rate, if you back up the contribution from Guardicore in Q3, that's probably a reasonable number. If you're solving for what we gave you in terms of 20% constant currency, somewhere in that 14% to 16% constant currency. Obviously, I can't predict where FX is going to be. But if you just kind of keep it what it was this quarter, that's -- you're doing roughly the right math. Alexander Henderson : So a similar kind of question. If I take the Linode comments, it looks like that actually accelerated from about a 15% baseline growth rate to around 20%, making the adjustment for the Linode acquisition. On an as-reported basis, that's actually pretty good, considering the currency. Can you talk a little bit about the geographic play between -- in the Linode business and how much currency would have impacted that side of it? And then again, as we look into the baseline growth rate, it does seem like it's accelerating. Can you talk a little bit about whether that's a function of the investments you're making in marketing and like? Or whether that's something that's sustainable in the guide? Edward McGowan : Sure. So I'll start with the currency with Linode. So not -- they -- when we acquired Linode, most if not all of their revenue was in U.S. dollars. So they were not billing in local currency. So there's not as much currency headwinds associated with the Linode portion of the business. Obviously, with the non-Linode compute business, we have the normal dynamics in our business. On the investments in terms of marketing, et cetera, I think we can maintain the current levels, and I'm not expecting a significant increase in marketing spend next year. We are increasing it a bit, but nothing significant. From a sales perspective, we are adding some sales folks, some specialists, especially on the technical side, to help our sales force, but it's not going to be a significant investment there. We believe our sales force can be trained, and we're also changing our comp plans to have an added incentive for compute. So all of that, I think, can fit into sort of a normal run rate expense level that we've been sort of operating, and I don't see any major investments in that part of the business. Alexander Henderson : If I could slide in one last one, since I'm the last guy here. As the mix shifts here, how do you expect the mix shift between the segments to start impacting the overall margins? Edward McGowan : Yes. So obviously, if you go back to the IR Day slides, and there was a question earlier about the leverage that we get on the compute business, as the faster-growing parts of the business security and compute become a bigger part of the business, we should get some operating leverage. It won't happen right away, but over time. Then obviously, there's the dynamic that we talked about with some accelerated CapEx ahead of revenue. So that's another thing to keep in mind. The other thing you notice -- I talked a bit about having a bit of a pressure on the gross margin line. That also, I would say, is more of a temporary thing. We will be reducing the gross margin line as we move our third-party costs over, but also with some of the build-out costs, including some of our colocation agreements, network build costs, a little bit that's front-loaded. So as revenue scales, we should start to see some scale in the gross margin line as well. So as Tom talked about, security should be our biggest product line. It's got higher gross margins, higher operating margin. So we should start to see that flow through as the mix changes to those 2 product lines over time. Thomson Leighton : And thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at a number of investor conferences and presenting at events, road shows and other things throughout the rest of the fourth quarter. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. So thank you for joining us. And all of us here at Akamai wish continued good health to you and yours, and have a nice evening. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tom Barth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 14, 2023. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section at akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range on both the top and bottom lines, despite ongoing challenges with the global economic environment. Q4 revenue was $928 million, up 6% year-over-year in constant currency. Our revenue growth was driven by continued strong demand for our security products, our fast-growing compute business and by higher-than-expected delivery traffic. Security and compute accounted for 55% of our overall revenue in the fourth quarter and grew a combined 22% year-over-year in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 28%. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1.37 per diluted share, down 2% year-over-year in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $3.62 billion up 8% over 2021 in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29%, down from 32% in 2021 and slightly below our goal of 30%. The decline last year was due to the impact of foreign exchange, the challenging macroeconomic environment, the investments we made to grow Guardicore's segmentation product and the rising cost of third-party cloud services. As Ed will describe in a few minutes, we're taking several actions to reduce costs and to shift resources to areas with the strongest potential for growth, such as cybersecurity and especially cloud computing. Going forward, we anticipate that our margins will likely remain slightly under 30% in the near term, and our goal is to grow margins back over 30% during the medium to long term. Non-GAAP EPS last year was $5.37, down 1% over 2021 in constant currency. 2022 was another strong year for cash generation at Akamai, with $816 million in free cash flow, representing 23% of revenue. Akamai's strong cash generation enables us to make strategic acquisitions while also returning value to shareholders. In 2022, we spent $608 million to buy back 6.4 million shares. Over the last 10 years, we've reduced the number of Akamai shares outstanding by approximately $21 million or 12%. I'll now say a few words about each of our three main lines of business, starting with security. Our security products generated revenue of $400 million in Q4, up 14% year-over-year in constant currency. For the full year, security revenue reached $1.54 billion and grew 20% over 2021 in constant currency. We saw especially strong growth through our market-leading Guardicore Segmentation product with revenue reaching $68 million for the full year. New segmentation customers in Q4 included one of the largest insurance companies in the U.S., a leading Internet services conglomerate in Japan and one of the largest banks in Scandinavia. Enterprises are choosing our segmentation solution because of its ability to protect against ransomware and data exfiltration attacks and also for the visibility it provides into their internal infrastructure. These are also among the reasons that Akamai was named as the Leader in The Forrester New Wave for Microsegmentation last year. We also saw large wins for our market-leading application security solutions in Q4, including at one of the UK's largest multinational energy companies, one of the big three multinational banks in Singapore and two of the largest tech hardware companies in the U.S. Overall, security accounted for 43% of our revenue last year, up from 39% in 2021. In 2023, we expect security to become our largest line of business. This represents a significant milestone in our evolution since we pioneered the CDN marketplace 25 years ago. That said, and as the security business becomes larger and with customers becoming more cost conscious due to the challenging macroeconomic environment, the growth rate of our security business has slowed, a trend that we anticipate will continue over the coming year. As you might expect, we're working hard to realize the full potential of our security business, both in terms of growth and efficiency. For example, we're in the process of moving the compute components of our security products from third-party cloud providers to our new Akamai connected cloud platform a transformation that will save us a substantial amount of OpEx over the next several years. We're redeploying resources within security from lower growth areas to high-growth areas such as segmentation. And we're redeploying go-to-market resources to achieve stronger cross-sell and penetration within our existing base. We're also working more closely with partners to drive better adoption among new customers. And we're continuing to innovate new capabilities, such as our recently released Account Protector and our new Brand Protector solutions to keep our customers safe amidst a rapidly evolving attack landscape. While we believe that our security business will continue to generate strong returns for our shareholders, we foresee an even bigger opportunity in cloud computing and its potential to return Akamai to double-digit top line growth over the longer term. Our compute business performed well in Q4 with revenue of $112 million up 65% year-over-year in constant currency. For the full year, compute revenue was $405 million and grew 64% over 2021 in constant currency. Earlier today, we unveiled Akamai Connected Cloud, our massively distributed platform for cloud computing, security and content delivery. Akamai Connected Cloud links Linode's 11 core data centers with Akamai's 4,100 edge computing locations. In addition, we're in the process of building out 14 more core enterprise scale data centers with at least 3 expected to come online in the next few months. We believe integrating these core cloud computing data centers with our unique edge platform will allow us to offer customers better performance, greater scale and lower cost for enterprise workloads. We also plan to have our new virtual private cloud capability and the first of more than 50 distributed cloud computing sites available in the second half of the year. The distributed sites will enable us to bring cloud computing much closer to end users around the world, which will further enhance the performance benefits of Akamai Connected Cloud. Of course, and as Ed will describe shortly, we'll be incurring substantial CapEx and colocation costs associated with the build-out of our compute infrastructure over the near term. We're also in the process of recasting approximately 1,000 positions or about 10% of our workforce to spend the majority of their time working on the development, deployment, support and go-to-market efforts associated with Akamai Connected Cloud. Because of the natural synergy and close integration between cloud computing and our existing edge platform, we believe we can accomplish this transformation without adding significant headcount to the business. This shift will also further enhance the efficiency of our delivery business. We're undertaking this ambitious investment in Akamai Connected Cloud because we believe it will create substantial value for shareholders in the medium and long term. We expect to achieve nearly $0.5 billion in revenue from compute in 2023, and the investment we're making this year should help drive that number substantially higher in 2024 and beyond as we use the new capabilities and capacity to support mission-critical enterprise workloads. I think it's worth noting that Akamai is taking a fundamentally different approach to the cloud computing market than providers who base their platforms solely on core data centers. Our strategy is to offer the world's most distributed platform placing compute, storage, data base and other cloud services closer to end users and enterprise data centers. As IDC\u2019s VP of Research Dave McCarthy says \u201cThe cloud\u2019s next phase requires a shift in how developers and enterprises think about getting applications and data closer to their customers. It redefines how the industry looks at things like performance, scale, cost and security as workloads are no longer built for one place but are delivered across a wide spectrum of compute and geography.\u201d IDC adds that \u201cAkamai's innovative rethinking of how this gets done and how it is architecting the Akamai Connected Cloud, puts it in a unique position to usher in an exciting new era for technology and to help enterprises build, deploy, and secure distributed applications.\u201d We couldn\u2019t agree more, distributed applications require a distributed architecture. Akamai\u2019s leadership positioned at the edge of the Internet enables us to scale just about everything we touch. We scale content putting digital experiences closer to users than anyone. We scale cybersecurity, keeping threats father away from business and people. And now, we are building on Akamai\u2019s 25 years of experience with scaling and securing the Internet for the world\u2019s largest enterprises, so we can scale cloud computing and provide better performance at lower cost. Although we still have much work to do, we are encouraged by the reaction from customers who want to realize the value of our approach. Last quarter, a well-known digital fitness platform brought business to us that they previously did with a major cloud provider. They chose Akamai Connected Cloud because we can optimize their performance and provide better economics. When a gaming company suffered a DDoS attack that took out their Internet relay chat servers, they turned to Akamai Connected Cloud to get back on line. After utilizing connected cloud for a few weeks, they also migrated their peer-to-peer match making servers to Akamai. This is what they say to other gaming businesses with similar use cases : \u201cOur adoption of Akamai\u2019s cloud computing services was painless and turnkey. Akamai has a great backbone network and the connected layer between our global servers has been rock solid. With Akamai\u2019s extensive global network we provide a better experience to our gamers by delivering from the edge and reducing latency. With Akamai, there is no reason to go anywhere else.\u201d  As you can see from this example, there's a strong synergy between our emerging cloud computing business and our delivery and security businesses, especially for customers in the gaming, media and commerce verticals. Turning now to content delivery. Our CDN business generated revenue of $415 million in Q4, down 8% from Q4 and 2021 in constant currency. For the full year, delivery revenue was $1.67 billion, also down 8% year-over-year. Traffic on the network was better than expected in Q4, reaching a new peak record of 261 terabits per second on December 14 as we supported more than 50 customers globally in delivering the World Cup, along with other streaming, gaming and software download businesses. This World Cup was the first time in Akamai's 25-year history when we delivered more than an exabyte of data for an event. How much is an exabyte? It's 1,000 petabytes. That's 1 billion gigabytes. For the person transcribing this call, that's 1 byte with 18 zeros after it. That's a lot of zeros and a lot of traffic. I doubt if anyone has managed such a feat before.  Once again, Akamai finished the year as the CDN market leader by far, as we continue to support the world's leading brands by delivering reliable, secure, high-performing online experiences. Looking back at 2022, we're pleased that we continue to grow the business and add significant new capabilities in the face of serious global macroeconomic challenges. Today, we're redefining our future with Akamai Connected Cloud to become the world's most distributed cloud platform with leading solutions for delivery, security and cloud computing. With our expanded strategy and business model, we believe that we're on a path to provide even greater value for shareholders and to make Akamai the cloud company that powers and protects life online. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our Q4 and full year results and our outlook for 2023. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. Today, I plan to provide brief highlights of our strong Q4 results, some color on 2023 and touch on some items to help you with your models and then close with our Q1 and full year 2023 guidance. Starting with Q4 highlights. We were very pleased with our strong Q4 results despite continued difficult macroeconomic conditions. Q4 revenue was $928 million, up 2% year-over-year or 6% in constant currency. We saw very strong growth in both our compute and security businesses as well as better-than-expected traffic in our delivery business during the fourth quarter. As Tom mentioned, our compute business was $112 million, growing 61% year-over-year as reported and 65% in constant currency. We continue to be very pleased with the initial feedback from our customers on our future compute capabilities, and we are very optimistic about capturing a meaningful share of our customers' cloud spend in the years to come. Our security revenue was $400 million, up 10% year-over-year and up 14% in constant currency. Our delivery revenue was $415 million, which declined 12% year-over-year and 8% in constant currency. Traffic exceeded our expectations during the quarter, led by higher video traffic, stronger-than-expected commerce traffic and record-setting World Cup online viewership. International revenue was $445 million, up 4% year-over-year or up 12% in constant currency, representing 48% of our total revenue in Q4. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $2 million on a sequential basis and negative $36 million on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $216 million or $1.37 of earnings per diluted share, down 8% year-over-year and down 2% in constant currency, but $0.07 above the high end of our guidance range. Moving to our capital allocation strategy. During the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $178 million to buy back approximately 2.1 million shares. For the full year, we spent approximately $608 million to buy back approximately 6.4 million shares. We ended 2022 with approximately $1.2 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Our intention is to continue to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases. It's worth noting that in addition to offsetting dilution, we have reduced shares outstanding by approximately 21.2 million shares or 12% since January 1, 2013. Before I move on to guidance, there are several items that I want to highlight to help you with your 2023 models. The first relates to a change in our network server useful lives. As some of you may recall, we announced on our Q4 2018 earnings call that we were required to extend the useful life of our network servers from 4 years to 5 years based on the actual server useful life trends. We carefully monitor the useful lives of all of our capital assets annually. And based on the outcome of our most recent review, we now are extending the useful lives of our servers from 5 years to 6 years. Similar to when we made the change 4 years ago, this extended useful life is a direct result of the continued software and hardware initiatives that we have put in place to manage our global network more efficiently. Because we are now using the servers in our network for an average of 6 years we are required under GAAP accounting to adjust our useful life policy to 6 years beginning in Q1 of 2023. Please keep in mind that this change has no impact on cash flow, but will result in a depreciation benefit of roughly $56 million in 2023 and approximately $31 million in 2024. We have provided a supplemental table in the Investor Relations section of our website that details the impact of this change. Second, we are expecting non-GAAP gross margins to decline by approximately 2 points in 2023 due to two primary items. First, as we build out our new compute locations, we are required to account for our colocation leases under GAAP accounting standard ASC 842. In order to achieve more favourable unit economics, we often sign longer term colocation agreements that include certain financial commitments. ASC 842 requires we straight line the cost of those future financial commitments over the life of the agreement. As a result, we expect to record approximately $40 million of noncash colocation costs related to this accounting standard in 2023. The second item impacting gross margin is our third-party cloud costs, as we've mentioned in the past, we expect to migrate the majority of our third-party cloud spend on to our own cloud infrastructure over the next 12 to 18 months. That said, we expect the majority of the migration effort to impact the back half of the year. We expect we will incur just over a $100 million of third-party cloud costs and cost of goods sold in 2023. We do, however, expect we will exit the year on a path to significantly lower our third-party cloud costs from 2024. Third, we expect international sales will represent nearly half of our total revenue in 2023 and the currency markets remain incredibly volatile. I will provide more detail on the impact of currency on each quarter's earnings call, but it's important to note that the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar can have a material impact on our reported results and guidance. As a reminder, the currencies that have the largest impact on our business are the euro, the yen and the Great British pound. Fourth, I want to remind you of the typical seasonality that we experienced on the top and bottom lines throughout the year. Regarding revenue, the fourth quarter is usually our strongest quarter, and we typically see a step down in Q1 revenue from Q4 levels. Regarding profitability, as a reminder, in Q3, we have the annual company-wide merit increase; and in Q4, we typically see higher sales commission expense. And one final thought before we move on to guidance. Tom mentioned that we will be investing in what we believe will be two areas of higher growth for the company for years to come : security and compute. While we expect to manage the business below our target operating margin of 30% in 2023 and we expect 2023 to be a higher-than-normal year for CapEx, we will continue to reduce costs and drive efficiency gains in key areas such as third-party cloud savings. We expect to save over $100 million in annual cost as we migrate workloads from the hyperscalers to our own platform over the next 12 to 18 months.  Real estate rationalization. As our employees have largely elected to work remotely, we expect to reduce our real estate costs by approximately $20 million in 2023 and achieve further savings in 2024. Shifting resources. As Tom mentioned, we'll be incurring substantial CapEx and colocation costs associated with the build-out of our compute infrastructure over the near term. As a result, we are prioritizing certain actions and retasking approximately 1,000 positions from other parts of the business to our compute business. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we closed approximately 500 open positions and we will continue to be very prudent with any headcount additions during the year. Finally, we are lowering CapEx related to delivery. We expect to reduce our CapEx related to the delivery business to 4% of revenue in 2023.  Now moving on to guidance. Our guidance for 2023 assumes no material changes, good or bad, in the current macroeconomic landscape which we view as challenging, but navigable. For the first quarter of 2023, we are projecting revenue in the range of million to $900 million to $915 million or up 0% to 1% as reported or 2% to 3% in constant currency over Q1 2022. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $13 million impact on Q1 revenue compared to Q4 levels, but a negative $19 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 73%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $299 million to $303 million. We anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of approximately 39% to 40%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $109 million to $111 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27% to 28% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.30 to $1.34. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $43 million to $44 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17.5%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 157 million shares. Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $220 million to $228 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the first quarter. This represents approximately 24% to 25% of anticipated total revenue. Looking ahead to the full year, we expect revenue of $3.7 billion to $3.78 billion, which is up 2% to 4% year-over-year, both in as reported and in constant currency. We expect security revenue growth to be in the low double digits for the full year 2023. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27% to 28% and full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 21% of total revenue. We expect our CapEx to be roughly broken down as follows : approximately 4% of revenue for our delivery business; approximately 9% of revenue for our compute business, of which roughly $100 million of that will be for internal workloads moving in-house and the remainder for future revenue growth; approximately 7% of revenue for capitalized software; and the remaining about 1% for IT and facility-related spend. We expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.40 to $5.60. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 17.5% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 157 million shares. In closing, we are very pleased with the strong finish to 2022, and we are excited about our growth prospects in both security and cloud computing. Now, Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : I appreciate all those details on the moving part. Ed, I know there's a lot there. I actually want to dive into the security business here. Tom, you had mentioned thinking about go-to-market investments and looking to prioritize on how to better address the market. Are you guys changing at all how you're approaching the market, especially on the network security side with Zero Trust as it seems to be a little bit of a disconnect? And, Ed, is it possible we can actually get an update on what that access control Zero Trust kind of business finished at for 2022? Tom Leighton : Yes. No, good question. And we are increasing the allocation of our go-to-market investments around the enterprise side and Zero Trust. We have specialist teams there really focused on Guardicore and now the other enterprise products as we integrate them in with the Guardicore solution. And we've had a lot of success with that team, as you can see from the really good growth in the Guardicore product. And so we're doubling down there. And over the course of this year, you'll see, I think, more cross-sell with our Enterprise Application Access product in Guardicore and ETP. And then I'll turn the other question over to Ed. Ed McGowan : Jim. Yes. So what I'd say about Zero Trust is we ended the year on a run rate of about $200 million in Zero Trust. And we had a very strong finish to Guardicore. In Guardicore, we'd expect this year to be on a run rate of $100 million. So a very, very strong finish to the year with Guardicore. James Fish : Helpful. And just a follow-up on the compute side. A big question we've been getting is whether the compute business could get traction really outside the media vertical? Or is that really going to be the focus in terms of gaming and streaming kind of storage and compute on the back end? And kind of what's the confidence level that you're not going to see an erosion in that more traditional windows that's SMB based? Tom Leighton : I think media is the big first set of adopters. In fact, as you know, one of the world's largest, if not the largest social media company is already using it. And I think that's because media really is concerned about performance. And so we're doing things like transcoding, much closer to the end user. And that's a key thesis of our architecture and our approach to compute is to be much more distributed with the compute, have containers and VMs much closer to the end users. Gaming, another example, what that makes a lot of sense. Things like leaderboards, manage groups of users as they play the game, you need low latency, there's a lot of back and forth with the clients and you want that to be close to the end user. That said, this is not limited to media. Commerce is also very sensitive to performance, and we've already signed up commerce companies. And commerce companies, of course, especially with these macroeconomic challenges. Akamai Connected Cloud, better performance at a more competitive price point. So I think you'll see penetration in the commerce vertical as well. And of course, Akamai is really close to the big companies in media and commerce. I have the opportunity to talk to the most senior executives in many of these companies, and they're very interested in what we can do for them. And they've been asking us to do this. And I think they're excited about the potential Akamai Connected Cloud. I think down the road, take a little bit longer. The financial vertical is another vertical that's very strong for Akamai because of our work in security and our market-leading products there. There, we have a little bit more work to do on the certifications. The bar is a little bit higher for financial institutions, but I think that would follow media and commerce in terms of adoption of Akamai Connected Cloud. Operator : Our next question will come from James Breen with William Blair. James Breen : Can you just talk a little bit about sort of the internal decision-making around shifting resources to the security and cloud side and maybe a little bit on the delivery side of market share to some extent, giving up some market share within that business sort of better for the overall profitability in the long term? Tom Leighton : Well, yes, I think it makes good sense to be shifting resources towards the higher growth areas both security but especially in cloud computing. I think we'll see a lot stronger return on the investment. We still have the market-leading delivery business. We haven't lost share, to the best of my knowledge. We have turned away some -- a small amount of the business that's very spiky. And that doesn't make as much sense for us to take that business at the price point isn't right today. And that's because traffic growth rates are lower than they used to be. So you have to spend money to build out for the spike. And if your traffic growth rates are lower, it takes longer to fill that capacity on a daily basis. With delivery, your cost is associated with your peak and your revenue more associated with the daily usage or total aggregate usage. And so we have, as we've talked about, turned down some deals there just because the ROI doesn't make us much sense in this environment, and we get a lot better ROI from investing in compute and I think, obviously, security. And then within security, we're reallocating investment decisions there to focus more resources on the fastest-growing security products. So I think it just makes good sense. And for now with compute, it's something our customers are really asking us to do. And even in this challenging macroeconomic environment, it's something that I think the timing may be even a little bit better there because of that. Operator : Our next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. A couple of questions, I have a ton of questions, but I'll try to limit it to two or three. On the cloud computing side of the equation, the word of the year amongst investors has been optimization, and we've heard it from AWS, we've heard it from Azure. I'm really interested to hear how that impacted Linode. Given kind of being a lower cost provider in the marketplace, did you guys -- did you see optimization of people trying to sort of reduce the amount of consumption on your platform? Are you guys like more of a net beneficiary because of, people are ultimately seeking just kind of lower cost overall? And then also on cloud, I don't know, did you guys mention what the contribution was from Linode this quarter? I believe you guys have been given the kind of inorganic contribution over the past couple of quarters. And then I have one for Ed on the margin side of the equation. Tom Leighton : All right. I'll take the first part of that and let Ed take the second part. I think Linode is a much smaller company and really sort of a different market than the giant cloud companies that are maybe referring to optimization. So I didn't see -- we don't see a big impact on Linode. Now what we're doing is making Linode so it can be used by the big enterprises for mission-critical applications. And that, in part, is building out scale. It's making it be more distributed, available in more cities, integrating it with the Akamai platform and our Edge regions and increasing the functionality. So a lot of work taking place on the Linode platform so we can sell it at a much higher scale to major enterprises. And we're in the stage now with early adopters there. And I think as we get towards the end of this year, we'll be in a position to take on a lot more business there. And I think the value proposition is that we would have better performance will be more distributed, closer to end users at a more competitive price point. And I think in this environment, yes, pricing matters, especially if you look at -- as we talked about, big media, big commerce, they care. And they are spending a lot in the cloud today. So I think that's the phenomenon you'll see take effect as we're in a position to take on more large-scale business for large enterprises. And then Ed, you can take the second part of that question. Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So Linode, it will get more difficult to break up sort of merging in with everything, but it was about $34 million, a little over $34 million. We did see a slight increase in the growth rate as the year went on, and we haven't seen any change in the consumption around optimization, meaning folks are using less of the cloud at this point. Keith Weiss : Perfect. Perfect. And then on the expense side of the equation. I just want to make sure I understanding this correctly. It sounds like you're slowing down or pausing hiring and I'm assuming you close those positions that could be hired into them, but you just like tick it off of the job board, if you will, and then repositioning employees rather than any like restructuring or headcount reduction. So should the way that we should be thinking about it is you're aiming towards relatively flat headcount in 2023? Ed McGowan : Yes, Keith. So the way to think it will probably go up a little bit. It won't be up as much as it's been up certainly last year. But I mean, you're thinking about it in the right way. And one of the things that we're fortunate enough to do is if you think about what we would -- the typical company would do if you didn't have the skill sets and how it should have to do a layoff, that's expensive and then you have to go hire new talent. We're fortunate enough in the areas that Tom talked about, whether it's development or build out of the network, the sales functions that we can shift those resources over. So if you think about the cost to build out what we're doing, would cause somebody else a significant amount of money, but we're able to shift those resources. And as far as the new headcount going forward, we're going to be pretty judicious with where we're hiring, but it's going to be primarily in the areas of cloud and security and maybe a few on the go-to-market side. Keith Weiss : Got it. And the shift take place both in terms of development as well as go-to-market? Or is it more so like the development resources are being shifted? Tom Leighton : There's a lot of resources being shifted within our platform and delivery organizations. Think of the hundreds of people that are managing our network deployment that build out our 4,100 regions today and the tremendous scale we have, and they are now heavily focused on building out compute resources. Think of the people that manage the operations, the automatic deployment of software, the payload or the load balancing, the resiliency, they are heavily focused on incorporating those capabilities for compute, building on top of the Linode framework. So I would say the large majority of the resources are of that nature that we're retasking. Operator : Our next question will come from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Tim Horan : Also on the cloud, can you talk a little bit about your improvement in price and performance versus the comments? Can you give us some metrics there? And then can you talk a little bit about what type of cloud you're building out for? I know, Tom, in the past, you were a little skeptical that we could do kind of gaming as a service over cloud infrastructure. Is that changing? And you could optimize your cloud for AI or blockchain or more networking or very, very low latency? Just any color there? And then lastly, have you contemplated maybe partnering with some of the larger cloud providers with AI really starting to take off? Can you be a partner to a few of them or one of them that would really accelerate things? Tom Leighton : Yes, good questions. We'll be the most distributed cloud services provider. And of course, we start with 4,100 POPs for function as a service, JavaScript at the edge. And we're building out the core cloud capabilities. And then this notion of the -- of a more distributed containers closer to the edge, VMs closer to the edge. Now that will give you better performance for things where you want to be close to the end user because it will be closer to more end users will be in some cases, countries where you don't have a presence from the hyperscalers. And our pricing will be less already. You can look at the list pricing and see that it's less than what the hyperscalers charge. And we're -- because we're integrating it with our backbone and with our edge platform, that gives us great economics on the delivery, taking the data in and out of storage or compute and getting it to end users. We're in a position to do that at a lower cost and to give consumers a better price point. Yes, this works not for all gaming functions, but for a lot of the things you want to do with gaming. It's a great use case, streaming, obviously, transcoding, APIs, chatting APIs, people communicating during a sporting event. That's all -- is very relevant to having a more distributed model. AI, I think elementary stuff you can put in a container or VM yes, that makes perfect sense. If you want to have the monolithic storage associated with that, that's more cloud, core cloud compute, I would say. I think in terms of partnering, yes, we have a lot of customers that obviously use Akamai services today as well as the cloud giants. In fact, the cloud giants themselves, a couple of them are very large Akamai customers. And so they also use their own services. So I think it's an ecosystem where, yes, I think there'll be customers that would use us and use the hyperscalers depending on the application and what they're looking to do. And we very much believe in a multi-cloud approach. Operator : Our next question will come from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Is it possible to ballpark the revenue contribution that was driven by this huge scale of the World Cup so that we could then remove that from our models for the next 3 years and then, I guess, presumably included back in year four? Ed McGowan : Yes. Mark, it's Ed. There's about $5 million, roughly. Mark Murphy : Okay. Got it. And then as a follow-up, just to clarify, during Q4, were you able to capture some of the business that Amazon is losing either due to the lower pricing structure that you have for Linode or because you have this advantage of broader points of presence? I guess I'm just interested in -- it sounds like from what you're describing, that potential is there. I'm just wondering if there was a material benefit or tailwind from that in Q4? Tom Leighton : Not in compute in Q4. Obviously, we compete very successfully in delivery and security with the hyperscalers. We're the market leader there. Now in compute, they are the market leaders by far. And so nothing that we would do in compute is going to make any difference to them. I mean we're looking to get to a 1% market share in a market that's $100 billion to $200 billion a year. So it will take us a while in compute before I think a hyperscaler would even really, really notice. And of course, a 1% or 2% market share means a lot to us in compute, that's several billion dollars means less, obviously, to folks at the scale of those guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Rishi Jaluria : Wonderful. I've got two. First, I wanted to start on the compute side of the equation. I appreciate all the color around CapEx. And please forgive me if my math is shouty over here. But if I just do a rough back of the envelope numbers, right, with 9% of total revenue being CapEx, specifically for the compute business and then I strip out $100 million of nonrecurring, that's still telling me that CapEx -- compute CapEx this year in 2023 is going to be 45% of compute revenue, which, again, it's a growing business and everything. Number one, am I directionally thinking about this? And maybe number -- piece number 2 to that is, how should we be thinking about steady state CapEx for the compute business once we get through maybe the next year or 1.5 years? And then I've got a follow-up. Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So you're doing the math right. So the way to think about the $100 million, that will enable us for our internal use, that will enable us to save lot more than $100 million. So think of it -- you think about it right in terms of as a onetime sort of burst of a charge. Obviously, if we continue to use our own compute capabilities over time down the road. We will be adding a little bit from time to time there. But you're thinking about that correctly. In terms of what does the steady state look like? We talked at the Analyst Day about how you can approximate sort of future growth percentage with what you would spend. So for example, if we are -- of the $1 billion we're spending 30% in CapEx, our growth rate would be probably around 30%. It's not quite dollar for dollar, but it\u2019s sort of a rough approximation. So think of us spending roughly $100 million this year on internal use another, say, call it, 225 to 250 depending on where you are on your models. That enables you to get that type of revenue scale potentially. Obviously, it's going to have to play out in the market to be a little bit more if we get a little bit less. That's a pretty decent rule of thumb. And then obviously, as we're growing out these locations, we're pretty ambitious in terms of the core locations that we're putting online also distributed locations are putting online. We're going to be investing ahead of revenue. So I would expect for the next 1.5 years or 2 years to have elevated CapEx related to the compute business, and we'll start to scale into it. Rishi Jaluria : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe going back to the security business. Going past this year, longer term, what needs to happen to see security overall reaccelerate growth rate that you'd be happy with? Is that primarily going to be driven by a continued Guardicore mix shift? Is that going to be more on the Zero Trust portfolio ex Guardicore? Maybe walk us through kind of what needs to happen to get security up to kind of an organic growth rate that you'd be happy with? Tom Leighton : Yes. No, I think you characterized it well, and it is more the mix shift to the newer products for us that are growing at a rapid rate, but are still relatively small. We've got a substantial return from Bot Manager now. That's a great example, starting to really help. Next is Guardicore, which, as Ed mentioned, we want to -- as we exit should be at over $100 million run rate. And once you start getting to that size and it's rapidly growing, it starts making a difference for the big security number. And of course, as that number gets bigger, it obviously gets more challenging to maintain the higher growth rates. We're continuing to invest in new capabilities there. Account Protector is off to a very good start, really excited about that. But it will take time to do that. And we're continuing to look for potential acquisitions that can help jump start growth. I don't think anything huge. It gets you the return right away, but areas that we think are really important that we can become market leaders in like we've done for application firewall, bot management, for segmentation and that over then a period of years can drive significant growth for us. Operator : Next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Two questions for me as well. I guess the first one, when we think about 2% to 4% kind of top line growth in '23 in constant currency, I think you talked about security growing double digits. Is there a way to think about how do you think growth stacks up on the compute and delivery side as well for the year? Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So well, we didn't give specific guidance for either delivery or compute. Tom did talk about us achieving $0.5 billion or so in compute revenue. So depending on where you put your models, you decide the $0.5 billion for compute and just solve for the delivery. I think if you were to be on the higher end of the business, delivery might do a little bit better as we saw in Q4, potentially get security going. If the macroeconomic conditions improve and then obviously there really is just a timing issue in terms of when we can start moving major workloads on compute. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then as we think about sort of the path from, let's just say, 27.5% operating margins that you'll be at in '23, towards just 30% kind of target you folks have had in the -- you have now actually, what do you think takes to achieve that target? Is there a revenue number that you need to get there or a mix or the cost reduction? If you could just maybe provide a bit of a bridge on how do you get from 27.5% to 30% EBIT margins, that would be really helpful? Ed McGowan : Yes. So it's a little bit of everything, right? But I think as we laid out about five or six different things that we're doing, probably the biggest near-term item would be the third-party cloud costs. So as we migrate that our own cloud, we're going to save about $100 million or so. Think about that as some of that will happen this year, a lot more of it in '24 and then by '25, we should have almost the majority of our internal cloud or third-party cloud on our eternal system. So that's 2 points to 3 points right there. Colocation, I talked a bit about the audit of the ASC 842 in lease accounting. We have a little bit more of a burden that we have to take at the beginning of some of these longer-term agreements. But also, we're spending on colocation that we haven't quite scaled into yet. So there's your question about revenue. As revenue scales, you'll get scale with your margins. And then just through some of the depreciation savings that we're getting on delivery and the real estate savings. We're spending, call it, before this year around $100 million in real estate, we're going to save about $20 million this year. Probably room to get maybe another $20 million or $30 million out of that as well. So it's really a combination of getting the compute revenue to scale into our investments in mostly our colocation facilities and third-party cloud savings, those are probably the two biggest areas for margin expansion. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. It sounds like most of the ramp to margins is going to be driven by self-help levers versus revenue tailwinds. I mean, it seems like the skew might be a bit more on self-help. Is that a fair way to characterize it? Ed McGowan : Yes. I mean I think that's -- when you look at the size of those numbers, certainly, I mean, obviously, revenue cures all your rails, right? We've got a pretty scalable model. So if we see acceleration in revenue, especially on the compute side, you're going to see a pretty good flow-through. But yes, there's a lot in our control here. And I think we're doing the responsible things as far as hiring goes, shifting resources, focusing on reducing our real estate costs and really focusing on driving down that third-party cloud cost, which is really taken a pretty big chunk out of our gross margin. Operator : Our next question will come from Fatima Boolani with Citi. Fatima Boolani : Two for me. On the delivery segment, the last couple of years for you have been maybe a little bit more erratic just by way of lapping some of the benefits from the pandemic, some of the dynamics you saw in the gaming area where trends are moderating. So at a high level for you, when we think about the underlying cadence from a volume perspective, what are you assuming that's maybe different the same, better or worse versus the trends you saw this year? And I'm considering the renewal cohort what you've mentioned around holding on pricing. So any sort of color commentary you can give us for the delivery segment in terms of traffic trends and then pricing trends under the hood? And then I have a follow-up, please. Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. Great question. So let me see if I can pick that all at once here. So in terms of the major renewals, we don't have nearly as many major renewals as we had last year. So that's going to be one thing that works in our favor. We are not anticipating in our guidance any significant increase in traffic in terms of levels of growth that we saw last year. We're anticipating a slight increase, but nothing significant. We're anticipating that and we're starting to see that price declines are moderating a bit. They're not nearly as steep as they've been in the past. And then we will continue our posture in terms of being a little bit more selective with some of the spiky traffic. Once we start seeing volumes get back to the historical Internet growth rates and beyond, then maybe that posture may change, but that's the way we're going to play it for now. Fatima Boolani : I appreciate that. And just the delineation between your U.S. business and the international business, anything you can point to by way of geographical differences in procurement? Is there more sensitivity on budgets in the U.S. versus international? Any characterization there because international continues to be a stronghold for you versus some of the -- maybe some of the malaise on the U.S. side, but would love to get a little bit more granular on what's continuing to drive that strength and if some of that budgetary pressure that you alluded to on the security side is maybe showing up more pronouncedly in U.S. versus international? That's it for me. Ed McGowan : Sure. Yes, I would say just kind of general macro across all regions. I'd say new customer acquisition is more challenging in an environment like this. And I think you hear a lot of companies talk about that. We're seeing that as well.  In terms of geographic, obviously, the European economy is struggling a bit more than we are in the U.S., slightly higher inflation, et cetera. So I expect that area to be a bit more weaker than what I'm seeing in the U.S. Asia is still been pretty strong. Latin America has been pretty strong. U.S. has been kind of holding firm here. But I would expect the European business, in particular, is to be the most impacted by the macroeconomic factors. Operator : Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Frank Louthan : So with the significant number of POPs that you have already, what is it about the cloud platform that you need to expand these sites? What is about the location and the capabilities that they bring for expanding the compute platform that you generally have? And then you touched on a possibility for M&A. What do you consider significant? And what are the -- what size M&A do you think you might be looking at if you do any in the next 12 months? Tom Leighton : Yes. So on the Akamai Connected Cloud architecture, we already have 4,100 edge regions. And these regions do delivery and security. They're the first line of defense. They also do what we call edge computing, which is function as a service, JavaScript at the edge. Now in the core, where Linode had 11 data centers, and we're going to more than double that, you have very large-scale storage object and block storage. You've got VM as a service, Container as a Service, Kubernetes, core cloud compute. Now we're adding also an intermediate layer, we call those sort of the distributed compute layer. And this would have not the monolithic storage, but you'd have containers as a service. Kubernetes, VMs as a service, so you could do compute there. And so what you do and where you want to do it depends on the application, things that are a lot of back and forth with the end user that are lighter weight, that could be handled in JavaScript. You want to be doing that in the 4,100 edge regions, something like transcoding, you're doing some data processing, you got an app in a container, but performance matters, you want to be close to the end user or say a gaming application that you'll want to do in our distributed edge platform. And the reason we have that is there's a lot of cities and places in the world that don't have a giant cloud data center there. And they can't really take advantage of the cloud for applications that have -- where the proximity to the user is important, and so that's something that we want to be able to provide. So there's three sort of levels here of compute and you want to be actually using generally all three for a major company, but the specific application dictates where you want to be doing it and what combination that you want to use. Frank Louthan : Okay. Potential for M&A and thoughts on what you would consider significant versus more tuck-in? Tom Leighton : Yes, good. So I think tuck-ins are a team that has the beginnings of a product or technology that we can scale on behalf of our customers. We've done a lot of acquisitions like that. More substantial would be something like Guardicore that had, at that time, the #2 product in the marketplace, and we've invested around that. They're now #1, which is great to see and a more significant cost associated with that. And they had a developed product already. Go back farther Prolexic is another example of that where they had a developed product, they already had $40 million, $50 million in ARR. And those are -- we do occasionally, and we're always looking. But we do those occasionally. But more you'll see the tech tuck-ins and then we develop from there. Operator : Our next question will come from Rudy Kessinger with D.A. Davidson. Rudy Kessinger : I guess I'm curious, how did the macro trend in the quarter just with deals lengthening? And how many deals did you see push, I guess, relative to Q3? And the guide assumes no positive or negative change in the macro. Just why make that assumption, why not be a bit more conservative, maybe assuming it gets a little worse? Ed McGowan : Yes. So this is Ed. So in terms of the biggest impact on the quarter, I would say coming in, we're expecting potentially a weak commerce season. We actually saw a pretty decent commerce season. We saw a decent video traffic. We saw obviously, we talked about the World Cup being better than our expectations. I would say gaming was noticeably weak. We didn't see as much activities you typically see. And then from the sales side, a couple of deals pushed a few large Guardicore deals we track that push and then also new customer acquisitions are slower than we'd like to see. Those are really the big things. Then as far as the macroeconomic conditions, it's tough when you sit in the seat to try to play economist. And with us, obviously, exit has probably the biggest impact on us more than anything, given we've got longer-term contracts. But it's hard to say that, look, things can change and get dramatically worse. I'm just expecting what I see right now in front of us in terms of the macroeconomic environment is challenging, but I think we can navigate it pretty well. So that's what we based our guidance on. If things change, we'll obviously update the guidance. But I was just trying to -- a lot of times people asked me what was what we were thinking as you put your guidance that are you expecting things to get dramatically worse. In this case, no, I expect things to be dramatically better not kind of roughly the end if things do change, we'll obviously update you as we get more information. Rudy Kessinger : Yes. Okay. That's fair. And then at a higher level, I mean, obviously, it sounds like compute has kind of slotted into growth priority one, if you will, kind of ahead of security. And just at the high level, I'm curious what really is giving you conviction to invest so much in compute. Is it the early customers that you've signed? Is it just conversations? Is it the pipeline growth you've seen over the last few quarters since you made the acquisition? What's giving you so much conviction to make such a large investment go-on on compute? Tom Leighton : Well, it's all of the above plus the compelling logic of the situation. As I mentioned, I do have the opportunity to meet with the senior most executives that a lot of the world's largest companies, especially you think media, commerce, gaming and so forth. And there is a lot of interest there in our ability to help them. They're in a situation where they're spending a ton on third-party cloud. It's growing rapidly. Many of them describe it as being out of control. and it's even hard to know how big it will get. In some cases, they're spending this with a competitor. And on top of it, they've got major company initiatives to cut cost because of the challenging global economic conditions. And so when we can offer them a service with at least as good, better performance, at a lower price point, that's very attractive. Now on top of it, these companies, they know us well. They already trust us with scale and performance and security because we provide the vast majority of their delivery and security. So we are a very logical choice. It's not like we're just somebody coming along here saying, hey, we got a cloud service. It's not like that at all. We've got a lot of credibility with these companies and they are pretty clear that they think this could be very attractive for them. In fact, I think one of the analysts on this call did a survey of 50 of our larger customers have found the same thing. The same thing was reported to them. So we see that our customers need that and would like to shift business to us, but we want to get ready for that and help them. And that means building out the capacity building out the new distributed architecture and getting the functionality to the level that they're going to be comfortable putting mission-critical applications at very large scale on our platform. And of course, Akamai will be one of the first examples of that. We're going to place our services that are used by pretty much all the major enterprises, a lot of the major enterprises out there for, for example, security onto our platform. And that will be another great proof point that Akamai Connected Cloud is really going to work for them. Operator : Our next question will come from Ray McDonough with Guggenheim. Ray McDonough : Tom, maybe just to ask the M&A question in a slightly different way. As we think about the strategic plan going forward, do you feel the organization has enough operational capacity to continue to expand Linode right now and do another acquisition in security at this point to help you reaccelerate growth? And is 20% long-term growth including acquisitions in the security business, something you are still targeting after this year? Tom Leighton : Yes, good question. First, the work on Linode which is extensive is use different teams by and large than our security technology group. And so yes, we are in a position that we can continue that work and also do security acquisition. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any challenge there.  Now we have, as we talked about, retask a lot of the positions, either people or positions from our platform and delivery organizations to the compute effort. So there is a lot of effort there, and that will be increasing throughout the year.  Now in terms of the 20%, what we're talking about is we're guiding this year into the low double digits and then we'll see where we are. Obviously, we'd like to be growing faster than that, but there are very challenging conditions out there, as we've talked about, and we'll have to see. So we'll update that guidance as we -- maybe we get to an Investor Day or get into next year. But right now, we're just guiding for this year in security in the low double digits. Ray McDonough : Great. And one more, if I could. The work we've done on Land does suggest your customer base is interested in leveraging Linode. And when I think about sort of the lead times for capacity additions in the data center space that you've already leased, how long are the lead times to fill that data center space? And at what point would you expect it at least to get to a somewhat full utilization of just the space that you've already contracted for? Tom Leighton : Yes. So good question. There's the contracting, there's the build-out, there's getting it all turned on. And the way you want to think of it is we would be doing the core data center build-out. The focus of that is in the first half, and we'll have a lot of that done then, and we should finish that early in the second half or get substantially more than we have today. And then late in the second half, taking on the distributed architecture, we should have a bunch of those regions turned on live later in the year. And at that point and also, at the same time, getting the certifications in place, virtual private cloud, other capabilities that the big enterprises need so that when we get to the later part of the year, we're in a position that we can take on this business, and it will just happen all at once. A major enterprise will try it, use some applications and then some of the big ones, you port some of the traffic over.  And so I think the major feeling of it and use of it really comes more in '24, not so much this year. We expect, as we talked about this year to do about $0.5 billion in compute. But the real growth, I think and the monetization of what we are building out now comes in '24 and '25. And also for our own use. This year, we are in the process of porting our own applications. And as Ed talked about we are going to save some this year but really the big savings for us comes in '24. So that's the way I think to think about it. Tom Barth : Well, it is Valentine's Day. So we're in a little bit over. But operator, why don't we take one more question? I know there's probably a few more, but let's just take one more and we'll end the call. Operator : Okay. Our last question will come from Michael Elias with Cowen & Company. Michael Elias : Just two questions for you. The first is you talked about some Guardicore deals slipping. And last quarter, there was commentary around longating sales cycles. Just wondering if you could give us some color on how sales cycles have evolved for not only Guardicore but the broader portfolio? And then my second question for you is maybe to phrase it a different or frame it a different way, is there a rule of thumb that we should use to think about the correlation between incremental revenue and incremental megawatts of data center capacity that you need, i.e., to support an incremental $100 million in compute revenue, you would need x amount of megawatts? Ed McGowan : All right. I'll try, the second one is going to be a little bit more challenging and maybe I'll come back with a metric on that one. I don't have exact metric down to the megawatt, but I'm sure somewhere in the business, I can find somebody who does. But I've sort of used sort of a rule of thumb of $1 of CapEx is $1 of revenue roughly speaking, that may change a bit, but sort of a good rule of thumb. In terms of sales cycles, the good news with the deals slipping is they're not going away. This is typically a big purchase that you make, especially with Guardicore that it could be something where the decision-maker is just pushing it off a quarter or two. And it's not that the deals are losing. It just becomes a longer sales cycle and a fight for budget. In terms of just overall sales cycles, like I said, the biggest impact is new customers, right? It's a lot easier with your existing customers, you're going through renewal cycles, you're having upgrade conversations and things like that, getting new customers to open up a new buying pattern is challenging. I do think one thing that will work in our advantage in all of this, though, is as we talk about compute and the need to find a cheaper alternative go multi-cloud. I think that's going to work in our favor. So I think one thing this -- all the negatives that come with the macroeconomic backdrop that we have. I think that's one positive that will work in our favor, and we are starting to see our pipeline grow pretty dramatically in that area. And as Tom talked about, we should start to see deals close towards the back half of the year and then really set ourselves up for '24. Tom Barth : Okay. Well, thank you, Michael. Thank you, everyone. And in closing, we'll be presenting at several investor conferences and events throughout the rest of the first quarter. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section at akamai.com. We want to thank all of you for joining us, and we wish you a very good health and good health to your family. So have a nice evening. Take care. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day. And welcome to the Akamai Technologies First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tom Barth : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's first quarter 2023 earnings call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 9, 2023. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, Akamai delivered strong results in the first quarter, with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high end of our guidance range.  Revenue grew to $916 million, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 29% in Q1. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.40. In what has been a good start to the year for Akamai, we've continued to invest in the key areas that we expect to drive our future growth while also taking actions to improve margins.  As Ed will explain in his portion of the call, we remain focused on returning to our operating margin target of at least 30% as we work to accelerate growth. I'll now say a few words about each of our three main product areas, starting with security. For the first time in Akamai's 25-year history, security represented the largest share of Akamai's revenue in Q1. This marks a significant milestone for Akamai since our expansion into security a decade ago.  While we take pride in this achievement, we're focused on accelerating our security revenue growth rate from here, both organically and through disciplined M&A. For example, this past week, we closed our acquisition of Neosec, which complements Akamai's market-leading app and API security portfolio by extending our capabilities in the rapidly growing API security market. Last year saw a record number of web app and API attacks more than double the number in 2021. The rapid rise in API attacks is becoming a critical challenge for enterprises across all verticals and with IDC and Gartner now projecting the API security market to exceed $1 billion by 2027.  The company we acquired, Neosec, is a powerful SaaS security platform that leverages AI-based behavioral analytics, unmatched visibility and threat hunting capabilities to discover APIs, analyze their behavior, identify vulnerabilities and help customers defend against attacks. We plan to take Neosec to market immediately while our combined teams work together on product innovation with the majority of its engineers located in Tel Aviv, where we already have a significant security engineering presence, we expect Neosec will be an excellent fit with our culture. And like our Guardicore acquisition, we can sell Neosec to customers that don't use our CDM. Speaking of Guardicore our segmentation solution to protect against ransomware continued to achieve strong traction with new customers in Q1, including with one of the largest banking groups in Europe and one of the largest airlines in the UK. We're also continuing our organic investment in innovative new products to help protect major enterprises. For example, at the RSA conference two weeks ago, our new Brand Protector Solution was named 1 of the 20 hottest security products by CRM. Another trade publication, CSO, listed both Brand Protector and our new Prolexic Network Cloud Firewall among the most interesting products to see at RSA this year. At RSA, we also featured a new managed security service called Akamai Hunt, Akamai agentless segmentation and multiple enhancements to our market-leading bot management solution. In addition to our investments in new products, we're focused on accelerating security growth by winning new customers and expanding our relationships with existing customers.  For example, one of the biggest security threats in the news last quarter was Kill net's coordinated series of DDoS attacks against some of the top medical centers in the U.S. In response, some very prominent health care institutions adopted Akamai's industry-leading solution for DDoS protection. In recognition of the value Akamai provides, the CIO of a world famous clinic e-mailed us afterward, thanking Akamai for enabling him to sleep well at night. We're also making good progress on the cloud computing front. Last quarter, we acquired the cloud storage company -- Ondat. Storage is a key component of cloud computing -- and we expect that Ondat's technology and considerable expertise will further enhance our enterprise-grade storage solution for Akamai Connected Cloud. Akamai intends to offer the world's most distributed platform placing compute, storage, databases and other cloud services closer to end users and enterprise datacenters. As a result, we believe that Akamai will be able to offer customers better performance, more points of presence and lower cost for many mission-critical enterprise workloads. That's the fundamental difference in our approach compared to other providers. We already have partners working with Akamai to run globally distributed databases with very low latency for synchronization. We have partners utilizing our cloud platform to provide customers with real-time visibility into telemetry from their end users around the world. We're working with customers in e-commerce, travel, hospitality, software as a service, media and entertainment to improve their ability to personalize experiences monetize content, accelerate data processing, facilitate collaboration, simplify management, improve performance and reduce costs, in some cases, by large amounts. And we're having early discussions about potentially leveraging Akamai Connected Cloud for AI inference engines.  Each of these use cases plays to Akamai's advantage in terms of numbers of POPs, global reach performance and cost. Another advantage that we hear repeatedly from customers, including those I met with last month at the NAB conference is that they trust us. They value the years of highly reliable service that we provided in delivery and security, and they trust us not to use their data to compete with them. I'll now say a few words about our delivery business, which experienced an encouraging uptick in traffic growth late in Q1. Akamai continues to be the market leader in delivery, providing industry-leading performance and scale as we continue to support the world's top brands by delivering reliable, secure and near flawless online experiences. And we continue to see a strong synergy between our delivery business and our security and compute offerings, especially for customers in the gaming, media and commerce verticals. The synergy is both on the top-line, as long-time delivery customers buy our security and compute products and also on the bottom line as we realize the cost benefits of using a single infrastructure to provide security and compute services as well as delivery. We plan to pass some of the cost savings on to our customers, which is especially valuable for customers who are paying exorbitant egress fees to the hyperscalers to access or move their data. The synergy of having a single cloud platform will also help us in our ongoing effort to improve profitability. Not only can we leverage existing infrastructure, but we can also leverage existing talent as we shift resources and focus from delivery to compute. As Ed will explain shortly, we are very focused on managing costs and deploying resources where they generate the best long-term returns. As one part of this effort, we plan to reduce our worldwide workforce by a little less than 3% this quarter. This was a difficult decision, but it was necessary for us to prioritize investments in the areas with the greatest potential for future growth as we strive to deliver greater value for shareholders.  I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their hard work on behalf of our customers and shareholders. From our developers and engineers who build and operate the services that power and protect life online, to our sales, services and marketing teams who do such a great job helping our customers in this challenging environment, and our back office and administrative support teams who help make Akamai be such a great place to work. It really is a privilege for me to be able to work with such an outstanding group of people as we make life better for billions of people, billions of times a day. While this is a time of substantial macroeconomic uncertainty, I believe that it is also a time of great future opportunity for Akamai as we bring new security and compute capabilities to market and as we deploy Akamai Connected Cloud.  As you may know, I continue to be a personal buyer of Akamai stock under the 10b5-1 plan that I filed last year. And I'm pleased to let you know that Akamai repurchased 4.6 million shares of Akamai stock in Q1 for a total of $349 million. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our Q1 results and our outlook for Q2 and the full year. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. Today, I plan to review our Q1 results and provide some color on Q2 and our updated full year 2023 guidance where we increased our expectations for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS while decreasing our planned CapEx spend for the year.  We were very pleased with our strong Q1 results in light of the continued difficult macroeconomic landscape. Total revenue for the first quarter was $916 million, up 1% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency. Security revenue was $406 million and is now our largest business representing 44% of total revenue. In the first quarter, Security revenue grew 6% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency. As a reminder, last year, we had roughly $7 million of upfront license revenue in Q1. If you normalize for this onetime impact, the security growth rate would have been approximately 11% in constant currency. Finally, I was also pleased to see we had a very strong bookings quarter in securities, specifically with our Guardicore segmentation and Lab Solutions. Moving on to Compute. Revenue was $116 million, growing 49% year-over-year as reported and 51% in constant currency. On a combined basis, our Security and Compute product lines represented 57% of total revenue, growing 13% year-over-year and 16% in constant currency. Now on to Delivery. Revenue was $394 million, which declined 11% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency. Delivery continues to provide strategic value in its customer base and generate strong cash flows. I'm optimistic about improving traffic volumes over the past two months and to a lesser extent, the slightly better pricing dynamics we've recently seen in the market. International revenue was $442 million, up 5% year-year and 9% in constant currency, representing 48% of total revenue in Q1. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $11 million on a sequential basis and a negative $21 million impact on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $218 million or $1.40 of earnings per diluted share, up 1% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range. Turning now to margins. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 29%. This was slightly above our plan, primarily due to higher-than-expected revenue and continued focus on operational efficiencies. During the first quarter, we recorded a $45 million restructuring charge, primarily related to severance costs, along with facility-related charges as we continue to reduce our real estate footprint. The impact of these charges has been incorporated into our second quarter and full year 2023 guidance.  In addition to these specific actions, we also continue to be very focused on cost savings initiatives I described last quarter, which include third-party cloud savings, continued real estate rationalization, depreciation expense and other operating costs associated with lower CapEx related to our delivery business, disciplined spending with vendors and tighter travel and expense policy management. I'm pleased with our progress on these initiatives, which helped drive improvements to our margins in Q1 compared to our expectations coming into the year. Moving now to cash and our use of capital. As of March 31, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.1 billion. During the first quarter, we have spent approximately $349 million to repurchase approximately 4.6 million shares. We now have just under $850 million remaining on our previously announced buyback authorization.  In addition to being aggressive with our buyback program, we have made two acquisitions since our last earnings call that will help drive revenue growth with Ondat in the first quarter and Neosec in the second quarter. We believe this demonstrates our continued balanced approach to capital allocation, opportunistically buying back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time while maintaining sufficient capital to deploy when strategic M&A presents itself. Before I provide our Q2 and full year 2023 guidance, I want to touch on some housekeeping items. Regarding our two acquisitions, while neither was material to revenue, both are expected to be dilutive to non-GAAP EPS in 2023, with Ondat dilutive by $0.02 to $0.04 and Neosec dilutive by $0.04 to $0.06. Finally, as you build out your models, I'd like to remind you our annual merit-based wage increases become effective in Q3. From a seasonality perspective, Q4 is typically our strongest financial performance quarter and the guidance I will provide assumes no change, good or bad to the current macroeconomic environment. So with those factors in mind, turning to our Q2 guidance. We are now projecting revenue in the range of $923 million to $937 million, up 2% to 4% as reported and 3% to 4% in constant currency over Q2, 2022. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $2 million impact on Q2 revenue compared to Q1 levels and a negative $3 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 73%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $300 million to $305 million. We expect Q2 EBITDA margins of approximately 41%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $116 million to $118 million and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28.5% for Q2.  Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $195 million to $202 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the second quarter. This represents approximately 21% to 22% of our projected total revenue. Based on our expectations for revenue and costs, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.38 to $1.42. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $45 million to $47 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17.5% to 18%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 153 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we now expect revenue of $3.740 billion to $3.785 billion, which is up 3% to 5% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. At current spot rates, our guidance assumes foreign exchange fluctuations will have a positive $3 million impact on revenue in 2023 on a year-over-year basis. We continue to expect Security revenue growth to be in the low-double-digits for the full year 2023, and we continue to expect to achieve approximately $0.5 billion in revenue from Compute in 2023. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% to 29%, and we now estimate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.69 to $5.84. Our non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 17.5% to 18% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 153 million shares. Finally, our updated full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 18.5% to 19% of total revenue. This CapEx is lower than our original expectations outlined last quarter due to strong pricing negotiations, resulting in better-than-anticipated server pricing, along with improved efficiencies, integrating Linode with Akamai's existing supply chain earlier than expected. In closing, we are very pleased with the strong start to 2023, and we look forward to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Thank you guys for taking the question. And nice quarter. Maybe one top line, on bottom line question. On the top-line side of the equation, you talked to strong bookings performance in the quarter, particularly with Guardicore. Is that a broader security kind of commentary? And maybe part of what kind of sustains kind of your confidence in the double-digit growth throughout the year, perhaps maybe even sort of do we see some acceleration on a go-forward basis based upon that booking. So one is kind of like a perspective on real time what's going on in Security? And then on the better operating margins on a go-forward basis. Can you give us some sense of where the headcount reductions are coming from in that 3% headcount reduction? And when we think about the better margins that you guys are projecting, how much of that comes from this recent round of headcount reductions, how much is just better OpEx controls that you guys exhibited thus far in the year? Thank you. Tom Leighton : Great. I'll take a first pass on these and then turn it over to Ed, and I'll get into more of the details. Yeah, we saw strong bookings and security across the board. It is a challenging environment out there for sure, especially with commits on larger deals. On the other hand, we do see a little bit of a silver lining, especially in the financial vertical, which is large for us. With everything that's going on in the banking sector, there is more concern than ever around security and reliability. And I think the last thing a major financial institution wants to see is some kind of problem now. An outage or some kind of half be successful. And I think that helps us. Akamai is widely recognized as the best when it comes to reliability and in terms of security. And so I think that is also helping us, especially vis-a-vis the competition.  We're also pretty excited about Neosec, A lot of very positive conversations early on with customers on top of Guardicore and of course, the whole suite of security products. In terms of margins, the focus of the reduction in force, on the go-to-market side, was really in the management layers and so that we can actually get more feet on the street in services, we can get more people helping customers, particularly in the areas of expertise with Security and Compute. And in some cases, in geographies that we feel are untapped and that we can get more leverage.  And with -- I think probably I'll turn it over to Ed now in terms of how this shapes up with all the other things we're doing to improve operational efficiency, Ed? Ed McGowan : Yeah, Keith. So we talked about taking a restructuring charge. About half of that was severance related so that the headcount savings and then the other half was -- or roughly half was related to real estate.  In terms of thinking about the headcount savings, our payroll is a little over $1 billion. We reduced a little less than 3%. So on an annualized basis, think of that as kind of in the $40 million range, give or take. We'll get about three quarters of the benefit of that this year. In terms of the real estate, we probably saved about 25% to 30% of our current spend. More to go there. I expect we can reduce that probably by a similar amount next year. The big savings to come is going to be in third-party cloud. We did see a reduction this quarter, which was nice. We reduced our spend as we start to optimize and start to move some things over. But that's a big one. That's about $100 million in total spend or a little bit more, and we'll start to see that benefit next year, a little bit more this year, but mostly into next year and into 2025. Team is doing a great job with vendor management, including being able to engineer out certain functions that we may be using a third party for. So I would say it's a combination of things, but just to sort of put it in perspective, that headcount savings is, call it, roughly a little over a point of margin on an annualized basis.  That also gives you giving you that sort of kind of run rate payroll number will give you the math necessary to build your models to factor in that annual increase that we give every year in the third quarter. Tom Leighton : Also, in terms of the reductions, obviously, we're directing a lot of resources that were on the delivery side of the house into compute. And that, in many cases, is the same person changing what they're doing, but also in this reduction that we're taking, you'll see that effect as well. Keith Weiss : Got it. And just to be clear, the lower CapEx intensity, it sounds like that's more efficient sourcing, not any change in the scope of build-out that you guys are expecting for the cloud side of the business? Ed McGowan : Yeah. So the way to think about that, Keith, is two things. One, we were able to benefit pretty significantly actually with the pricing reductions in the server pricing. My understanding is that's somewhat of an industry phenomenon, but also just given our buying power, a big chunk of that decline in CapEx was related to that.  The other thing that I find pretty exciting is we envisioned when we sort of built the models that we'll be able to integrate with our supply chain to be really tight with our demand and build, meaning not having to overbuild for demand. We've been able to knock down the time that it takes for us to deploy. So the initial builds that we're building out will be a little bit smaller than we originally anticipated because we expected a longer lead time with our supply chain. So now that we've been able to shrink that down we can tighten that up a bit.  So those are really the main factors, a little bit of push in terms of a couple of sites that can push into '24, but those two factors are pretty significant. And we're very happy that we're able to deliver that this quickly. Keith Weiss : Excellent. That's super helpful, guys. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from James Fish of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. James Fish : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question guys. Wanting to build off of Keith a little bit here. Now that you rolled out your objectives for 2023 here, how are you thinking about not just the CapEx intensity for this year as you're starting to kind of get the savings greater than you expected. Is this the right way to think about next year's capital spending? And I think, Tom, you actually had alluded to getting into that long-term 30%. Is there an update on the time frame there? Tom Leighton : Yeah. Let me take a first pass at this. This year is when we're doing the initial build-out for compute and obviously very substantial. And future years will depend on how fast we sell the capacity that we're building out now. And so if we're able to sell that quickly, then there would be more CapEx spend next year. If it takes us longer to fill that capacity, then you would see CapEx be much less next year. So it really depends on how rapidly we get uptake on the initial build-out that we're doing. And on the 30%, we're not issuing a specific time line there. But obviously, we're having, I think, really good success in our efficiency and we're taking actions to improve margins. And so we'd like to get back to 30% and beyond just as quickly as we can, subject to making the investments for future growth. And I'm very optimistic about our ability to do that.  Ed, was there something you'd like to add there? Ed McGowan : No, I think that covered it, Tom. James Fish : Great. And just a follow-up on the security side as well. It sounds like you guys are pointing to this being the kind of trough in growth. But as you think about network security offerings, in particular, including the Zero Trust overall portfolio not just Guardicore, how do you feel about your go-to-market -- how your go-to-market is aligned with selling these types of solutions that tend to go through indirect sources that really are MSPs that you guys have historically been lined up with? Thanks, guys. Ed McGowan : Yeah, I do think we should see improvement in security growth from here. And particularly now that we're adding API security into the mix, I think the channel is really important for us and it's something we're putting a lot of effort into it, especially on the enterprise security side. For example, Guardicore is all through the channel, very successful partnerships, and it's something we'll be focused on with API security as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please go ahead. Jonathan Ho : Hi, there. I just wanted to understand a little bit better about maybe your confidence level around the macro environment, what you're seeing out there? And why you're not potentially taking a more conservative stance. I think you said that your expected macro to remain consistent. Tom Leighton : Well, I think our guidance does reflect or the current situation and our view, we're not assuming that the macro environment will improve. And so I do think we are taking a reasonably conservative view going forward. We are very happy with the strong start to the year on several fronts as we talked about.  Ed, would you like to say a little bit more about that? Ed McGowan : Yeah, sure. I mean in terms of some of the negatives that you're seeing, obviously, sales cycles are a little bit longer. We are seeing difficulty with adding new customers with the exception of Guardicore. Tom alluded to the fact that Guardicore brought a pretty good channel organization with them, and we're seeing pretty good new logo acquisition there. So that's probably the exception to that rule.  We're seeing some pricing pressure from some verticals, we are seeing, I mentioned, better pricing environment for some of the higher media delivery business. Inflation obviously causes some challenges. We've seen some bankruptcies in the retail space and a couple in the financial services. None that's overly material. And as I said, we're not anticipating things to get worse. If things did get worse, potentially we'd see a little bit more of that. On the Pro side, we are seeing lower turnover of employees, faster time to hire, which isn't much of a surprise. With rates going up and we have cash interest rates are better for us from a reinvestment perspective, the dollar is slightly weaker. That may -- as the dollar gets weaker that helps our benefits. And then also just from the vendor side, just continued focus on pushing vendors for better pricing and things like that. So it's a mixed environment, obviously, a challenging environment. I think we're navigating through it pretty well. And we've built in what we thought we could achieve based on what we see today. Tom Leighton : On the silver lining side, as we get our compute offering, prepared to take on major mission-critical enterprise workloads, there is the potential that because we can do it less expensively, particularly for applications involving large amounts of data and delivery of data that, that could be a net benefit for us competitively in a time when companies are looking to cut costs. And is something a lot of our customers have told us, particularly customers with large volumes of data that they need to cut the cloud expense. And I think we'll be in a position to help them do that. And as I mentioned earlier, at a time like this when there's a lot of concern in the financial sector, Akamai's reliability and security, it really becomes paramount. And that's helpful to help mitigate the impacts of a difficult macroeconomic environment. Jonathan Ho : Excellent. And then just as a quick follow-up. In terms of the delivery business, I think you talked about some favorable trends around the traffic side. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of those improvements and maybe the sustainability of that as we think about, again, the delivery traffic? Thank you. Tom Leighton : Yes. About March, really of last year is when we really saw traffic growth take a hit, part because of the economy as a whole, part because of the war in Ukraine, and now we're lapping that. And so when you look at the year-over-year rates, indeed, they did start improving in March. And so we're optimistic about that and hope to see that be more sustainable just because you have a more reasonable compare. Ed, do you want to add more color on that? Ed McGowan : Yeah. The only thing I would add, I did touch a little bit on just slightly better pricing environment, which makes sense given the volumes. They're still not back to pre-pandemic levels, better than what we saw last year.  Also, we've seen in some accounts, some larger accounts, some vendor consolidation, and we've been a benefactor of that, which makes sense. Some customers will have four or five CDNs that can get to be pretty expensive. Sometimes they build up teams. They have technology they use for load balancing and things like that.  So as they consolidate vendors. And a lot of us have volume-based tiered pricing, so you can take advantage of lower unit economics as you consolidate to one or two vendors. So that's been a positive trend for us. It's another reason why we've seen a little bit of an uptick in traffic. Jonathan Ho : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is Rob on for Frank. So who do you run into in the marketplace now for compute specifically? And how would you guys evaluate the outlook for that business in particular going forward? And what's driving that outlook primarily? Tom Leighton : Yes, the hyperscalers and also do it yourselves. And I think the outlook for us is positive. We're not trying to take 30% market share. It's a $100 billion, $200 billion market. But we do think we can be very competitive for certain kinds of applications, particularly in the verticals where we do a lot of business, the media vertical, entertainment obviously, video, gaming, commerce. And that's because those customers, they know us, they like us, they use us for the delivery and security. And I think we're in a position to offer them a very compelling capability in terms of better performance and a lower price point. So we'll see. But so far, I think we're very pleased with what we've been hearing for customers, making good progress, getting our connected cloud platform built out, upgrading Lino to really take on large-scale mission-critical enterprise workloads. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Rudy Kessinger with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger : Hey, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to double click maybe on security. You said Guardicore $7 million of license revenue Q1 last year. Was there any license revenue for Guardicore this Q1 this year? Ed McGowan : Yeah. No, nothing material. No. Rudy Kessinger : Yeah. Okay. Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up on delivery, certainly stronger revenue performance than we expected. Is there -- I guess, was there anything in the quarter you talked about maybe some customers consolidating from four or five vendors, maybe to three. Anything in particular in the quarter that would give you hope that delivery maybe you could potentially turn that back to a, I don't know, say, a flat or maybe only a 3%-5% decline in business as opposed to a 10%-ish decline in business as we've seen over the last few quarters? Ed McGowan : Yeah. That's obviously continued traffic growth. I think if we get back to kind of pre-pandemic levels, that's certainly going to help. We've done a pretty good job on pricing, especially with the larger customers in the old web verticals, especially commerce, we're still seeing some pricing pressure there. So really, it's a combination. But I'd say the stronger traffic growth is going to be the main thing. As we get into Q2 and Q3, we've got slightly easier compare you recall last year, we had significant renewals in our top-10. We have renewals all the time, but that was an unusual year for that. So the double-digit declines, I wouldn't expect that certainly next quarter or the quarter after that. And in Q4 is always the toughest quarter to call, but things will get -- should get a little bit better from a year-over-year compare standpoint. But in terms of getting to sort of flat or even plus or minus a point, you're going to need to see stronger traffic growth than what we're seeing now. Rudy Kessinger : Got it. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Ray McDonough with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Ray McDonough : Great, thanks for taking the questions. Tom, maybe first for you. Another question around security go-to-market. I know you touched on the focus on the channel. But you did mention you were also redeploying go-to-market resources within the security group as well. Can you talk more specifically to the changes made in that organization? And is there any early results to point to from those changes that give you confidence that you will be able to reaccelerate growth here in the rest of 2023? Tom Leighton : Well, we're just taking the actions as we speak. So nothing to see directly from that yet. I would say they're in three areas. One is less investment in management and more in, say, feet on the street. The next would be more focused on security and compute and getting the right expertise in front of the customer, and that would be in presales and also in services. And then the third is a shift in resources to some of the, I would say, undertapped geographies, where we think there's the potential for a lot of growth. So I think all three are very helpful. And then, of course, channels, particularly for our enterprise security solutions, where that's, I think, a much -- a better way of doing it. For our established web app firewall, we do have a significant channel's presence but also a significant direct presence. And we expect to start seeing the benefits here towards the end of the year as we hire the new resources in these areas. Ray McDonough : That makes sense. And then maybe just a follow-up for you on Linode. I believe you've kind of outlined an expansion of 14 core datacenters by the end of the year and 50 distributed sites, I believe. Is that still the case? And maybe just following up on one of your comments earlier, can you talk about how much smaller the Compute footprints are this year, if it's a magnitude of size? And how comfortable you feel in terms of the lead times to add capacity if the macro environment or demand turns more quickly than you expect? Ed McGowan : Yeah. Why don't I start with the last part first. So in terms of the timing, I think we've got it down to probably 60 to 90 days, I think we can add capacity pretty quickly. We're building up -- working with our suppliers. We've had long-term relationships, structuring deals with them to be able to very quickly get our hands on equipment and building up some inventory and that sort of thing. So we feel pretty good about that. So I think -- and also these sales cycles are not immediate, right? So there's usually a trial period and that sort of thing, starting the conversations now. So it's not like CDNs where you can shift overnight, just move traffic within a day or two. So we will have good lead times there.  In terms of the actual size, I just say they're small, I don't have a specific number to throw out. We're on track to deliver all of our core sites. There's a couple coming online in Q2 and a bunch coming online in Q3, no change there. As far as the distributed sites, we will be building out a bunch of those. I don't have an updated figure for you. Some of them may push. Those are much smaller in terms of of CapEx. So that really doesn't have a major impact on CapEx. Each one of those sites are relatively small, so it's not going to have a material impact.  But in terms of what we're seeing with the supply chain, we feel pretty good. We've done a lot of work, great hats off to the team. They've done a fantastic job working with our suppliers to be able to really tighten things up, and you can see that in the updated guidance. Ray McDonough : Great. Appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question today comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Lauren on for Amit. So just to kind of double-click into buybacks and how you guys are thinking about the second half of the year after a fairly aggressive first quarter? That would be great. Tom Leighton : Yeah. Our policy and strategy really hasn't changed. And that includes -- there's times when we do buyback more shares that are needed to offset dilution from employee equity programs. And those are opportunistic. And in Q1, we felt there was a substantial opportunity to buyback more than the usual allotment.  And of course, we have a programmatic buyback that buys back more when the stock price is lower and buys back less when the stock price is higher. And so when the stock goes lower, the programmatic or automatic buying also increases. And as you know, the stock price was lower through a lot of Q1. So there's really no fundamental change in strategy. Prior to this year, over the last 10 years, we've bought back an extra 1% a year over and above the equity program dilution offset.  Obviously, Q1 was more than that. So there's not a specific change in strategy that would say we're going to buyback what we did in Q1 every quarter. So no change in strategy. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Mark Murphy at JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Indiscernible] on for Mark Murphy. Thanks for taking the call, and congrats on the quarter. Maybe just on compute. I think in the past, you've mentioned that the node hasn't faced the same optimization headwinds that the hyperscalers have. Curious if anything's changed on that front? Tom Leighton : Sorry, as in faced what headwinds? Unidentified Analyst : Sorry, the same optimization headwinds that the hyperscalers have been calling out the last few quarters? Tom Leighton : Yes, I think Linode is really in a very traditional, Linode a very different market and much more affordable and really not servicing the major enterprises. Major enterprises, at least the customers that we talk to are very worried about the rapidly growing cloud costs. And that's something that I think we're in a position to help them with as we get our infrastructure built out and get it ready to take on mission-critical workloads. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you so much for that additional color. I'll leave then and pass back to the operator. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions at this time. Tom Barth : Okay. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at several investor conferences and road shows throughout the rest of the second quarter. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Thank you for joining us, and all of us here at Akamai wish continued good health to you and yours. Have a nice evening. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. And we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. And have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Akamai Technologies Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Tom Barth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining Akamai\u2019s second quarter 2022 earnings call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Ed McGowan, Akamai\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today\u2019s comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai\u2019s filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent Akamai\u2019s view on August 9, 2022. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today\u2019s call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to report that Akamai delivered strong results in the second quarter despite the ongoing challenges with the global economic environment and slower Internet traffic growth. Q2 revenue was $903 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 9% in constant currency. This result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security and compute businesses, which when taken together were up 30% in constant currency. These two business lines now account for 54% of our overall revenue. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $1.35 per diluted share, down 5% year-over-year, but up 0.5% in constant currency. As Ed will discuss later, EPS was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates and a higher effective tax rate compared to last year. Free cash flow was very strong at $223 million in Q2 and it accounted for 25% of revenue. We have been leveraging our financial strength to make substantial investments in enterprise security and cloud computing. We have also used some of this cash to buyback additional stock. In the first half of the year, we spent $268 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares. This puts us on track to go beyond what\u2019s needed to offset dilution from employee equity programs this year. I\u2019ll now say a few words about each of our three main lines of business : security, compute and delivery, starting with security. Our Security Solutions generated revenue of $381 million in Q2, up 17% year-over-year and up 21% in constant currency. Growth in security was driven primarily by our app and API security portfolio, which includes our market-leading web app firewall, bot manager, account protector and page integrity manager solutions. Our Zero Trust enterprise security portfolio, led by Guardicore, also performed well in Q2 with numerous significant customer wins. A leading global provider of financial data concerned about ransomware, added Guardicore segmentation solution to the 7 security products they already buy from Akamai. A major insurance company in France became a new customer for Akamai when they adopted our Guardicore solution to help meet European financial regulations. The sale led by one of our carrier partners is indicative of the excitement we are seeing for our Zero Trust Solutions among our partners. An Australia\u2019s largest telecom provider, Telstra, expanded their business with us by adding our secure web gateway solution to their portfolio of Akamai products. They told us \u201cas part of Telstra\u2019s journey in delivering fit-for-purpose solutions, Akamai has been a key industry partner with network-based anti-phishing malware protection and content filtering. Telstra blocks millions of threats every single day and Akamai is a key partner in that protection.\u201d Overall, our Zero Trust Solutions delivered $43 million of revenue in Q2, up 59% year-over-year in constant currency. This is an area where we are making \u2013 continuing to make major investments and where we anticipate significant future growth. Turning now to compute. I am very pleased to report that the revenue for our Compute Product Group was $106 million in Q2, up 74% year-over-year and up 78% in constant currency. As a reminder, the Compute Product Group includes Linode and Akamai Solutions for edge computing, storage, cloud optimization and edge applications. A common theme that I heard when I met with executives from around the world in Q2 was their growing concern about being locked into contracts with cloud giants that are consuming large and rapidly increasing shares of their IT budgets. They want more choice in compute and are open to alternative clouds like Linode as a more efficient way to build, run and secure their applications. As a result, many large enterprises have begun testing the Linode platform, including a major U.S. airline, one of the world\u2019s top gaming companies and a global provider of weather data. Major media companies, in particular, expressed significant concerns with their growing use of the giant clouds. Not only are the costs high in part because of the fees from moving data [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Pardon, ladies and gentlemen, we have to interrupt the call at this time. One moment, please. Tom Barth : Okay. Sorry about that, everyone. We are ready to begin the real call. That was the warm up. I apologize again. And what I\u2019d like to do is introduce our CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton. Just standby for a minute. Operator, could you put the call on hold for me? We just had a little trouble with technical difficulties on the phone here. Operator : Yes. Thank you, everyone. We\u2019ll be on hold while you gather your information and get going again. Thank you, everyone. This is the operator. Thank you for holding standing by. We have Mr. Tom Barth, ready to take over again for the call. Please go ahead, sir. Tom Barth : Okay. Thank you, everyone, for your patience today. We\u2019re \u2013 again, I apologize for the technical glitch, but we are ready to go. And I\u2019d like to reintroduce our CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton. Tom? Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom and thank you all for joining us today. Sorry about the production snafu there. Anyway, I am very pleased to report that Akamai delivered strong results in the second quarter, with revenue coming in near the high-end of our guidance range and earnings exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by $0.07. Revenue grew to $936 million in Q2, up 4% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.49, up 10% as reported and up 11% in constant currency. As you can see, and as Ed will explain in his portion of the call, our actions to increase profitability are delivering good results. I\u2019ll now say a few words about each of our three main product areas, starting with security, which is our largest source of revenue. Security revenue grew to $433 million in Q2, up 14% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. The improvement in our security growth rate was driven by multiple products, with especially strong growth for our market-leading segmentation solution. We entered the segmentation market with our acquisition of Guardicore in Q4 of 2021 and we are nearing an annualized revenue run-rate of $100 million. At this scale, segmentation is having a bigger impact on our overall security growth rate. Customers are adopting our segmentation solution to help defend against ransomware and data exfiltration attacks, which have become more frequent and damaging. For example, last quarter, we signed a 3-year $8 million segmentation deal with one of the world\u2019s largest carriers. Large carriers and banks want to protect their consumer data from losses that can damage their brands and trigger large fines from regulators. They also appreciate spending less on legacy firewalls that no longer provide adequate protection. We also saw strong growth in Q2 for our market-leading web app firewall and bot management solutions, where we continue to fare well against the competition due in part to their challenges with reliability and performance. For example, we recently took business away from a competitor, 1 of the world\u2019s largest micro blocking platforms. outages on their former providers platform made the customers seek a more reliable partner. So they switched to Akamai for their global expansion plan in Europe and Asia. In another example, a leading Asian financial institution recently returned to Akamai, also because of reliability challenges with this competitor\u2019s platform. As we look to the future, we\u2019re also excited about our new API security solution that we announced last week, enabled in part by our acquisition of NeoSec in May. API security is rapidly emerging as a critical need for major enterprises. That\u2019s because as enterprises modernize their infrastructure to create better digital experiences. They\u2019re making increasing use of APIs to improve developer agility and end user performance. The problem is that these APIs are often not adequately secured, and they open up new vectors for attack. Our new API security product leverages AI-based analytics and threat hunting capabilities to discover APIs, analyze their behavior, identify vulnerabilities and help customers defend against attacks. Customers who thought they had 1,000 APIs might turn on API security and Discover hundreds more they never knew they had, with vulnerabilities lurking within legacy infrastructure or new applications. This is why banks are establishing API governance group today, and it helps to explain why IDC and Gartner project that the API security market will surpass $1 billion by 2027. Like our segmentation solution, customers can buy our API security product without being an Akamai CDN customer. These security solutions are CDN agnostic demonstrating how we can go to market as a security provider first. We also continue to make good progress on the cloud computing front. Akamai is taking a fundamentally new approach to cloud computing making it fully distributed with many more points of presence that are available with traditional solutions. By leveraging Akamai\u2019s unique platform and capabilities, we believe that we can offer enterprises better latency, better performance, automated scalability and portability and reduce costs, especially for applications that incur high egress fees with the hyperscalers. Since our call with you in May, we\u2019ve gone live with three new cloud computing sites in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Paris, and we plan to open 10 more later this year. These new sites are part of our plan to connect compute, storage, database and other services into the same platform that powers our edge network today, a massively distributed footprint that spans more than 4,100 locations and 130 countries. Last month, we also announced a doubling of the capacity of our object storage solution a new premium instances for large commercial workloads that are designed to deliver consistent performance with predictable resource and cost allocation and our plan to launch in beta the Akamai Global load balancer later this quarter. This new integrated service is designed to route traffic request to the optimal data center to minimize latency and ensure no single point of failure. We believe that the Akamai connected cloud will be ideally suited for applications that benefit from being closer to end users. For example, in e-commerce, our customers want to tailor their online shopping experience to the individual user. They also want the better performance you get by being closer to the end user. That\u2019s because better performance translates into higher conversion rates. In video and gaming, our customers want the game engine closer to the end user to reduce latency. And to tailor experiences based on the user\u2019s device type and connectivity. In AI, the basic models will be generated and trained in the core. But the inference engines, which generate alerts and responses to queries will be more efficient to run at the edge, where and when they\u2019re needed. And the cyber attackers exploit advances in AI to create more forms of malware and more dangerous bots, more security will be deployed at the edge to intercept attacks before they can reach and swap a customer\u2019s data center in the core. In all these areas, our customers also want the ability to spin up instances to handle flash crowds on demand, something that\u2019s very hard to do with competing cloud solutions. In summary, we believe that next-generation applications will need next-generation cloud infrastructure and Akamai is charting the course for this next decade of cloud computing. When more of the compute will be done closer to the end user and where we believe our platform will have an important edge over more centralized models. Turning now to content delivery, I am pleased to report that we continue to be the market leader, providing industry-leading performance and scale as we continue to support the world\u2019s top brands by delivering reliable, secure and near flawless online experiences. We enjoy a strong synergy between our delivery, security and cloud computing offerings as we power and protect life online. The synergy is both on the top line as long-time delivery customers buy our security and cloud computing products and also on the bottom line as we realize the cost benefits of using a single infrastructure to provide security and compute services as well as delivery. Overall, I am pleased to see that Akamai performed well in the first half of the year. Despite the macroeconomic challenges, we continue to invest in the key areas that we expect to drive our future growth while also taking actions to improve our profitability. Now I will turn the call over to Ed for more on our Q2 results and our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. Today, I plan to review our Q2 results and provide some color on Q3, along with our increased full year 2023 guidance. I\u2019m pleased that Q2 was another strong and very profitable quarter. I\u2019ll have more to say about our double-digit EPS growth in a moment. First, let\u2019s discuss revenue. Total revenue for the second quarter was $936 million, up 4% year-over-year. In the second quarter, Security revenue was $433 million, growing 14% year-over-year. As Tom mentioned, security revenue was driven by strong demand for our WAC, slot management and segmentation solutions. Moving to compute. Revenue was $123 million, growing 16% year-over-year as reported and 17% in constant currency. On a combined basis, our security and compute product lines represented 59% of total revenue growing 14% year-over-year and 15% in constant currency. Shifting to delivery. Revenue was $380 million, declining 9% year-over-year as reported and 8% in constant currency. International revenue was $456 million, up 7% year-over-year and 8% in constant currency and now represents approximately half of our total revenue. Foreign exchange fluctuations were flat on a sequential basis and negative $6 million on a year-over-year basis. Moving now to profitability. Non-GAAP net income was $228 million or $1.49 of earnings per diluted share, up 10% year-over-year and up 11% in constant currency. The strong EPS results exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.07 and were driven primarily by higher revenues, saving from savings from the head count actions we took earlier in the second quarter and continued progress on our cost savings initiatives. As a reminder, those cost savings initiatives include third-party cloud savings, rationalization of our real estate costs, depreciation expense and other operating costs associated with lower CapEx related to our delivery business, disciplined spending with vendors and tighter travel and expense policy management. With respect to third-party cloud spend, I\u2019m pleased to report that for as long as we attract this expense, Q2 was the first quarter where total third-party cloud spend declined year-over-year. While the decline was relatively modest, it reflects disciplined vendor management as well as the beginning of savings related to the migration of our workloads onto our own cloud platform. This migration effort to move away from third-party clouds is in the early stages, and we are seeing promising signs. For example, our bot management solution is now running production workloads for hundreds of customers on our own cloud computing platform. As a reminder, we anticipate that the amount of savings we will be able to achieve will start to ramp through the end of 2023 and into 2024 as we bring online the needed capacity and features. Moving to margins. Our cash gross margin was 73%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 41%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 29%, slightly ahead of our guidance. Moving now to cash and our use of capital, as of June 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1 billion. During the second quarter, we spent roughly $137 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares. We now have about $700 million remaining in our previously announced share buyback authorization. Our approach to capital allocation remains the same to opportunistically buyback shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time while maintaining sufficient capital to deploy when strategic M&A presents itself. Finally, I am pleased to announce that Akamai has obtained investment-grade credit ratings from Moody\u2019s and S&P. These ratings are part of a broader financial policy to further reinforce our business and financial strength, not only with investors but also with customers, vendors and other parties that we engage with from a commercial perspective. The credit rating also broadens our financial toolkit, allowing us to evaluate all available financing instruments to determine what\u2019s best suited for our financial goals. Finally, as a reminder, Akamai currently has two convertible debt instruments outstanding, $1.15 billion due in May 2025 and $1.15 billion due in September 2027. Before I provide our Q3 and full year 2023 guidance, I want to touch on some housekeeping items. First, our annual merit-based wage increases became effective July 1. This will result in an additional net operating cost of approximately $12 million per quarter. Second, in late July, the IRS released a notice that granted temporary relief for determining eligibility of foreign tax credits. This will result in a lower-than-expected non-GAAP effective tax rate in Q3 and for the full year. And finally, the guidance I will provide assumes no change, good or bad to the current macroeconomic environment. So with those factors in mind, I\u2019ll turn to our Q3 guidance. We are now projecting revenue in the range of $937 million to $952 million or up 6% to 8% as reported and 5% to 7% in constant currency over Q3 2022. The current spot rates foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $1 million impact on Q3 revenue compared to Q2 levels and a positive $10 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 74%. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $297 million to $302 million. We expect Q3 EBITDA margin of approximately 42%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $121 million to $123 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% for Q3. Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $162 million to $170 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the third quarter. This represents approximately 17% to 18% of our projected total revenue for the third quarter. Based on our expectations for revenue and costs, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS to be $1.48 to $1.52. The CPS guidance assumes taxes of $42 million to $45 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 16%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we have increased revenue to a range of $3.765 million to $3.795 billion, which is up 4% to 5% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. At current spot rates, our guidance assumes foreign exchange will have a negative $4 million impact to revenue in 2023 on a year-over-year basis. We are also raising our security revenue growth expectations to 12% to 14% for the full year 2023 and we continue to expect to achieve approximately $0.5 billion in revenue from compute in 2023. And despite a significant year of investments, we are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29%. With all that in mind, we have raised our estimated non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to a range of $5.87 to $5.95. Our non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 17% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Finally, our full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 19% of total revenue. In closing, we are very pleased with our financial achievements for the first half of the year, in our ability to increase our overall revenue, security revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year. We believe that Akamai is a special class of businesses that have the ability and discipline to invest in future revenue growth while continuing to be extremely profitable and generate significant cash flows. With that, we now look forward to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question will be from James Fish, Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. James Fish : Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter and the security [indiscernible]. And speaking of security, how should we think about the bookings heading into Q3 for this segment or the bookings related to us? And really, the crux of my question is \u2013 just trying to understand the sustainability here and understanding we\u2019re raising by 2 points for the full year. Just kind of give some color around the confidence for the year is really what I\u2019m asking. Ed McGowan : Hey, Jim, thanks for the question. This is Ed. I\u2019ll take that one. So I would say we had two back-to-back very strong quarters of bookings. So that was very encouraging. And we also saw strength and if I look at my sequential growth quarter-over-quarter, we actually saw all three major product lines accelerate. So we saw growth in API and protection segmentation was very strong. Guardicore was extremely strong in the quarter. And even the infrastructure business still has some hangover effect from the Kilmet attacks we saw earlier on. So all those product lines grew sequentially quarter-over-quarter. In terms of the customer penetration, if I go back to Q4 and look at where we are now, we saw about a 2.5% increase in customers buying a security product up to about 75.5%. So we\u2019re seeing great penetration in the installed base. just one other sound by for you. We now have about 700 customers who are buying four or more products in security. So we\u2019re seeing really good strength with new customer additions, bookings across all product lines. And then just another thing on segmentation. When we\u2019re seeing renewals with segmentation, we\u2019re seeing those renew very favorably and generally with expansion orders included. James Fish : Helpful. And then, Tom, maybe for you on the compute side. How are you guys looking to invest behind the GPU as a service side of Linode. Is this something your customers, particularly your large media customers are looking to deploy with you or do you see that as more reserve for the hyperscalers and so you\u2019re going to be more focused on that AI inference opportunity. Thanks, guys. Tom Leighton : Yes. We do support GPUs today. It\u2019s not our primary focus and that\u2019s just a financial decision. I would say gaming is more where you\u2019d see that with our big media customers doing video and media workflow, CPUs are just fine. And much more economical and attractive there. In terms of AI, I think over time, probably that migrates \u2013 at least in terms of the inference engines, migrates to CPU as well. And I think that, over time, as we talked about, probably something you want to be doing at the edge. But we\u2019re fully capable of supporting GPUs. We do that some today, really based on demand from our customer base and financials. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : I wanted to follow-up on the security question in the security business. We got a reacceleration this quarter. And I just want to understand like some of the drivers behind that, whether you\u2019re seeing a better spend environment. It sounded like the bookings were pretty solid. Is it sort of sales execution? Or are you seeing sort of like newer offerings like Guardicore sort of reach material scale to drive that sort of dollar growth on a year-over-year basis. I was wondering if you could sort of unpack the strength in security and what it could portend for future quarters. Tom Leighton : Yes. Ed talked to that somewhat. Let me just give some additional color there. It\u2019s still a challenging spend environment in general. So that \u2013 I would have said that\u2019s changed a lot. We are getting strong sales execution. And security is really important. And as we\u2019ve talked about before, in this environment, financial institutions, they just can\u2019t afford to have a glitch. And this is where our reliability really helps and stands out against the competition. They can\u2019t afford to get hacked. And again, we stand out there because we have the market-leading solutions for web app, firewall and for bot management. And with Guardicore, really seeing strong growth, as Ed talked about. And I think what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace is there\u2019s good tailwinds there. Particularly now you have Gen AI and already the tools are out there, the variance of that to produce more malignant bots to morph malware so it\u2019s harder to detect. You can train the bots pretty easily to get around a lot of the firewall defenses. And so I think what you\u2019re going to see is even more penetration of the traditional defenses. And at that point, what you really need is Guardicore to identify when you are penetrated and where and to proactively block the spread. So I think you\u2019re going to see more demand for segmentation is really the critical defense going forward. So strong \u2013 as Ed talked about, strong execution and performance across all three pillars. And then you look to the future, API security is going to be, I think, a very important market for us. Very early days but I think really critical. So it\u2019s really pleasing to see the momentum that we\u2019ve been building in the first half of the year with security and that can, I think, help drive us forward. Keith Weiss : I appreciate the thoughts, Tom. And just as a follow-up, sort of toggling to the delivery business. Just want to get an update, and you guys have talked about this before, but I just want to get an update on sort of the operating principles and the operating philosophy around the delivery business with respect to sort of managing for sort of revenue share versus harvesting for profit to fund investments in the compute business given the ambitious road map you have there? What sort of the right way we think that you guys are going to strike that balance between those two objectives? Tom Leighton : Yes. It really comes down to price and profitability. And as we\u2019ve talked about, we have turned down business that is very spiky, and we don\u2019t get what we think paid enough to do it. And so we\u2019ve left that to others to take. And meanwhile, growing the highly profitable delivery business, the core business there. And I think we are starting to see some positive signs there. Traffic growth is not where it was before the pandemic, but getting better. We\u2019re seeing some acceleration there, which is good. Price declines, I\u2019d say, softening a little bit here. And so I\u2019m optimistic that over the next 1 to 2 years, we should see more of a stabilization of that business. Still price pressure, but I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019re making there and strong cash generation. Keith Weiss : Thank you for the details, Tom. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Ray McDonough of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Ray McDonough : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Tom, maybe just to stay on the security side of things. Last quarter, you mentioned actions you were taking on the go-to-market side in security. And you mentioned execution as part of the driver of security reacceleration. But I\u2019m wondering if you could provide more color on the sort of go-to-market changes that might be working here. And we\u2019ve been hearing that Akamai has been more successful in engaging traditional security resellers recently. Has that helped drive an acceleration of growth here at all? Or is that still too early and maybe a contributor into the future? Tom Leighton : Our partners are very important for security sales. In fact, some of our products are partner only, for example, segmentation. And very pleased to just recently announced a partnership with WWT, that will be bundling in our solutions for segmentation and API security. And that kind of partnership is obviously very helpful for us in driving a lot of the improved execution. We also have dedicated resources for some of the newer and more advanced security services like segmentation. And I think that helps with sales. And we\u2019re seeing customers \u2013 new customers to Akamai, which is great and also upselling our solutions into the existing base. And as Ed noted, now 700 customers buying four different security solutions. And Ed, do you want to add anything to that? Ed McGowan : No, I think you covered it. We\u2019ve made a lot of the investments already. So there\u2019s not a big investment needed in the sales overlay functions. Very happy with that. As a matter of fact, lot of the new customer acquisition is coming from Guardicore. And they\u2019re actually getting penetration in some verticals that aren\u2019t traditionally strong. Like this quarter, we saw some wins in education, state and local government, manufacturing and pharmaceutical places that typically are a very big web properties that are typical CDN customers. So I think we\u2019re seeing really good execution across all the parts of security, direct sales, the overlay teams in the channel. Ray McDonough : Great. That makes sense. Maybe as a follow-up, Ed, I know Guardicore and some of your other businesses, there could be some upfront license deals that could contribute in any given quarter. Was there anything to call out from an upfront license recognition in the quarter in security, in particular, that might not be repeatable that we should just know about? And is there any renewals that might be coming up in the back half of the year that we should be aware of? Ed McGowan : Yes. So nothing material this quarter, a couple of million bucks, but nothing material. It\u2019s over a couple of points, I call it out, so nothing there to call out. One thing I will say, though, with the licensing we do with Guardicore in particular. It\u2019s term licenses, so it\u2019s generally 2 to 3 years typically. And those license deals were new and one of the comments I made earlier is that we are seeing very strong renewals. So when those license deals come up, we are seeing renewals typically with expansion orders, which is really encouraging. So you have somebody who\u2019s renewing and then adding on more protection across their internal infrastructure. But nothing to call out this quarter. Ray McDonough : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Frank Louthan, Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. On the delivery business, can you talk to us about any impact you think you might see from the writer strike. Do you think is that factoring any of that in the decline? And then just comment on the sort of the sequential change in the business there. What\u2019s sort of the outlook there for the rest of the year? Thanks. Ed McGowan : Hey, Brian, this is Ed. From the registry, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate any major impact from that, certainly not hearing anything from our customers there. Obviously, that potentially impact new releases, which you could take a couple of years to get out. But not seeing anything there. And in terms of the second part of the question, what are some of the fundamentals and what we\u2019re seeing. As Tom talked about, we are seeing traffic growth rates improve. It\u2019s going up a couple of points a quarter. Pricing is still a bit challenging and some of the old web performance verticals in commerce and a little bit in travel as well. But we are seeing with the larger customers, big media, traditional media customers pricing starting to abate a bit there still pricing declines were not nearly as steep. So, I think its profit continues to improve and we obviously have Q4 coming up in a few months, will be in Q4, and that always tends to be a generally strong quarter for the Internet as kids go back to school and new gaming consoles are sold and connected devices and all that stuff, and it also tends to be pretty popular with new TV series and sports and whatnot that we are optimistic that traffic should continue to improve. And as Tom talked about, hopefully, we get this business back to stable in the next year or so. Frank Louthan : Alright. Great. Are you seeing any more vendor consolidation like we saw earlier this year with some of the larger media companies? Ed McGowan : There is one probably, real notable one that went from five vendors down to two, and we were a leading provider there and did pick up some additional shares. So, we want the ones who won there, but nothing really notable this quarter. That happened, I think at the end of last quarter. Frank Louthan : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Mark Murphy, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is RD on for Mark Murphy. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Start off, you mentioned earlier that you expect to see stabilization in the delivery market over the next couple of years. Can you just describe what trends you are seeing that kind of leads you to think that? Ed McGowan : Sure, I will take this Tom, if you want to add something. So, I think it\u2019s really in the delivery business, it comes down to pricing and traffic growth rates. Now, we are starting to see traffic growth rates improve and also comps become a little bit easier. The other thing is we talked about moving away from some of the peak year business, what that will do is improve the profitability. So, the delivery business to us is a really strategic asset for us, right. It enables us to get really great economics, which will help our cloud business delivery function of cloud in a lot of ways. Also for our security business, which enables us to get the reach and the scale and the data for security. So, it\u2019s obviously a very strategic business. But in terms of like the stabilization, I would say we are seeing pricing moderate, especially with the larger customers, which is a good sign, traffic improving a bit, and if that continues, we should be back to hopefully a stable plus or minus a couple of points would be great. But I think one thing that the macroeconomic environment is causing a little bit of churn, if you will, or challenges in some of the traditional web verticals like commerce. So, that\u2019s going to have to work itself out as well. So, that may take a year or so for that to work its way out. But I think as we see traffic growth and pricing stabilize a bit more, we should be in pretty good shape. Tom Leighton : Yes. And the only thing I would add is that in this environment with higher interest rates and money is harder to get, there is a little less enthusiasm for investment in the lots of CDNs out there that are losing money. And as Ed noted, Akamai is a unique position that we generate a lot of cash from our delivery business. We are the market leader, we do it better than anybody. And the smaller companies that were okay losing money before, well, that\u2019s not so easy to do now. And so I think that does help maybe the overall environment a little bit, and we will see how that plays out over the next year or 2 years. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s very insightful. Thank you. And then with regards to Guardicore, it seems like you guys are having a bit of momentum on that front. Any changes in the competitive landscape win rates, anything along those lines? Tom Leighton : Yes, it\u2019s gotten more favorable for us. Our lead over the competition has widened as we\u2019ve made a lot of investments in Guardicore to improve its capabilities. And so now we are recognized by the analyst community is the market leader by a wide margin. And that\u2019s very good timing because that capability is an increasing need with major institutions. So, I think the competitive environment has become more favorable for us because of the work we have done to make it a great product. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. I will step back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be coming from Rishi Jaluria of RBC. Please go ahead. Rishi Jaluria : Hi. Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my questions guys. Nice to see the security reacceleration this quarter. I had a two-part question I wanted to ask about the compute business. First, can you talk a little bit about how some of your product investment in terms of getting Linode to be enterprise scale and to be truly competitive with the likes of either AWS and Azure, I think it got features and functionality like Kubernetes, for example, how those efforts are going? And maybe what learnings you have had as you have been migrating your own cloud spend onto that platform. And the second part, and Tom, you kind of hinted a little bit at this earlier, right? But let me look at what the hyperscale cloud vendors are saying, they are seeing a big uptick in demand right now as a result of generative AI workloads. And how do you think about your ability to capture some of those generative AI workloads as companies are thinking increasingly about adopting their generative AI strategy? And maybe are there additional investments you need to make in Linode to be able to capture some sort of some share of it? Thank you. Tom Leighton : Yes. Great questions. And we are making really good progress with Linode, Kubernetes. And really, it\u2019s about scale, and we talked about that. The build-out will be up to a couple of dozen core locations by the end of the year with a ton more capacity than we had before. Object storage and the new architecture there, much more capacity and capability. The certifications, we now have PCI compliance for our use, so we can run bot manager on it with market-leading bot management solution. We have 300 customers now using that solution on Akamai connected cloud instead of a third-party cloud. And that does take advantage of deep learning technology. So already, we have those capabilities, you have to support that on Akamai\u2019s cloud. I think overall, with the timeline, the way we think about it, by the end of this year, we should be in a position to start taking on more serious bookings or bookings with large customers for really important applications. We have a couple already using it and then start generating more revenue next year from major applications. Now, in terms of competing with the hyperscalers, we are not going to be fully competitive for every application. And we don\u2019t have to be. It\u2019s a $200 billion a year market, growing 15%. And we are targeting a subset of that market, primarily initially vertical media and gaming, followed by commerce after that, where in particular applications where performance matters. So, the application is being used in some way by end users or business partners, where you maybe want to have that application running closer, so it has better performance. Where scalability, rapid scalability matters and cost, especially for the applications that involve moving data around or have a lot of hits. And you see that in media, gaming and commerce. So, that\u2019s really what we are targeting, which is a pretty reasonable subset of the $200 billion. Now, within that subset, if you are an enterprise that uses a lot of the third-party apps that are available as managed services on the existing platforms, probably it\u2019s harder to migrate, and that\u2019s not where we would go first. Fortunately, if you look at media workflow and the areas where we are targeting, often that\u2019s not the case. And it\u2019s easier for us to manage the porting. Now, you don\u2019t just flip a switch, so it\u2019s not that easy, unfortunately. And we have learned that. But at Akamai, pretty much all of our applications are in the process of migrating from third-party cloud onto our compute platform. And so it does take some effort, but it is eminently doable, and we are going to save a lot by doing that. And we are not the biggest company out there. Our big media customers spend, well, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars a year in the cloud with often case, their primary competitor. And so I think we are in a position that we can now help them based on our experience, migrate a bunch of those applications to Akamai. Good for us, good for them. Rishi Jaluria : Wonderful. Really helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Rudy Kessinger, D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger : Hey great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just \u2013 I know a lot of questions have been asked on security. Can you share the Guardicore growth rate? What kind of growth are you seeing in that business? Ed McGowan : Hey, Rudy, this is Ed. About 60% year-over-year. And as Tom talked about, we should be at a $100 million run rate very, very soon. I would be surprised if we don\u2019t get there next quarter. Rudy Kessinger : Great. That is very impressive. As it relates to compute, 17% year-over-year constant currency that\u2019s fully organic figure this quarter as you have lapped that acquisition. The guide implies depending how you model the sequential is maybe 1 to 2 points of acceleration by year-end. I guess just how is the pipeline building for Linode as you get some of these sites online? And when should we expect to see more material growth acceleration? Just what are your growth aspirations there in terms of maybe 2024? Tom Leighton : Yes. So when you talk about Linode, almost all of the revenue there is in their traditional business, developers, small, medium enterprises, low-ARPU customers. That business was a little over $100 million a year when we bought it growing in the teens. It\u2019s growing a little bit faster now, but it\u2019s not \u2013 that\u2019s not the game changer. And why we bought Linode was to be able to use it as the base to create a service for major enterprises with mission-critical applications, very high ARPU accounts. And today, the revenue there, we have actually signed up a few important cases, customers. And so we do have revenue there now, but it\u2019s small in the millions of dollars. And so but that\u2019s where the growth comes from and that\u2019s \u2013 we are trying to get 1% of the $200 billion market, so over a period of time to go from a few million to a couple of billions. We don\u2019t have a timeframe on that yet, but we are trying to do that as quickly as we can. But that\u2019s where the real growth comes from and it starts from a very small portion of our roughly $0.5 billion compute business today. Rudy Kessinger : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Tom Barth : Operator, this is Tom Barth and it\u2019s time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will be from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe to start on the security side, can you just touch about \u2013 as you see the acceleration that\u2019s happening there, is that skewing more from new customers or expansion of existing customers, just any clear that would be helpful and then was there any licensing revenues that help you with Guardicore in June? Ed McGowan : Hey, Amit, this is Ed. So as I talked about earlier, there was really no material license revenue in the quarter. And as I said, I\u2019d call it anything, if it\u2019s a couple of points of growth or anything like that. So nothing to report there. In terms of the new customers and existing we are seeing, as I talked about, a pretty good expansion in the existing installed base, both with just pure penetration rates up a couple of points in the last two quarters to \u2013 as I look at customers buying multiple products. I mentioned earlier, we have over 700 customers now buying four products. So the majority of the revenue growth is coming from the installed base buying more, but I\u2019m very encouraged with the new logo acquisition, especially with what we\u2019re seeing in Guardicore. Very encouraging to see them be able to attract new customers and verticals that were typically not very strong in. So again, mostly from the installed base in terms of buying more products, which is great, but it\u2019s very encouraging on the new logo acquisition as well. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then if I can just follow-up on one thing. I think you talked about full year operating margins being around 29%. That\u2019s about what you have in the first half of the year as well. But that would imply that sales will accelerate in H2 versus H1 from a dollar basis, but operating margins don\u2019t go up. So maybe I am missing this, but what\u2019s the offset? Is it the merit increases or is there other offers to consider in terms of why aren\u2019t we seeing better operating leverage in the back half of the year? Ed McGowan : Yes. So two things there, one is the merit increases you called out. But also the depreciation picks up quite a bit because of the CapEx in the first half of the year. So those are really the two main drivers. But I\u2019m pretty pleased with what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish on the margin front, making huge investments in the business and acquisition, the big investments we\u2019re making in compute and to be able to deliver 29% operating margin for the year is pretty impressive and then to deliver \u2013 be able to raise EPS guidance. Very pleased with the team. I think everybody has pitched in and done a great job. So happy with that and pleased to see \u2013 is able to maintain the 29% margin despite the fact that there\u2019s increased depreciation and merit increases. . Amit Daryanani : Perfect. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Tom Barth : Thank you, Amit and thank you everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at several investor conferences and road shows throughout the rest of the third quarter. Details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section at akamai.com. Thank you for joining us and all of us here at Akamai wish you and yours a wonderful rest of the summer. Have a nice evening. Operator : Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Akamai Technology Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tom Barth : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on November 7, 2023. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent results in the third quarter with revenue, operating margin and earnings all exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Revenue grew to $965 million in Q3, up 9% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.63, up 29% year-over-year. Ed will cover the key factors that drove our bottom line performance in his portion of the call. I'll now say a few words about each of our 3 main product areas, starting with security, our largest source of revenue. Security revenue grew 20% year-over-year in Q3. The acceleration in security growth was driven in part by especially strong demand for our market-leading Guardicor segmentation solution as enterprises confront the ever-present threats from malware and especially ransomware. CISOs and corporate Boards everywhere have seen the recent headlines about devastating ransomware attacks, including at 2 casino hotels in Las Vegas, a major manufacturer of cleaning products in the U.S. and at a multinational provider of systems for smart buildings. One of them reportedly paid $15 million to get ransomware out of their systems. Another is reportedly spending $25 million to deal with the after effects and a third has reported more than $100 million in losses from the attack. Customers who purchased our segmentation solution last quarter include a major global services provider, one of the world's most recognized entertainment brands and a leading bank in Switzerland that renewed their segmentation protection with a significant upgrade. We also saw strong demand for our market-leading web app firewall solutions in Q3, where we continue to win against competitors who are challenged to provide the levels of reliability and performance required by major enterprises. Customers who switched to Akamai, including a nationwide retail chain in the U.S. and a leading global manufacturer based in India, also told us that our competitors simply can't provide the level of support and professional services that they need and have come to depend on from Akamai. Customers also value being able to purchase an entire suite of integrated security products from Akamai, a provider who they trust to keep them safe against a wide variety of attacks. For example, we're seeing very strong interest in our new API security solution that we announced last quarter. This new product is in its very early days, but we've already integrated it with our market-leading web app firewall solution to make it even easier for customers to implement. At the Black Hat security conference last quarter, Akamai API Security was named one of the 20 hottest new cybersecurity tools by CRN, a major trade publication for channel resellers. And as with Guardicore, you don't need to be a CDN customer to benefit from this new solution. Turning now to cloud computing. I'm pleased to say that we're on track with our product development, infrastructure deployment and conversations with customers about use cases well suited for the Akamai connected cloud. Since our last call, we've gone live with 7 more core compute regions in Amsterdam, Jakarta, Los Angeles, Miami, Milan, Osaka and Sao Paulo. In addition to the 6 that we opened earlier this year and the 11 that we acquired from Linode, this brings our total to 24 core compute regions to serve Akamai connected cloud customers. Of course, there are other cloud companies with a few dozen data centers. But Akamai is unique in having these data centers interconnected to the world's most distributed edge platform with more than 4100 points of presence across 750 cities and 130 countries. As one trade pub block and files recently wrote, Akamai is focusing on a future where scale becomes more about the size of the network versus the size of its data centers, more effectively powering modern applications. We agree. Akamai's massively distributed edge network, 25 years in the making and managed by Akamai's team of experts around the world is a key differentiator in our strategy. We believe that next-generation applications will need next-generation cloud infrastructure, and we intend to chart the course for the next decade of cloud computing when more of the compute will be done closer to the end user and where we believe our platform will have an important edge over more centralized models. As IDC put it in July, Akamai brings the simplicity, affordability and accessibility of its cloud computing services to larger commercial customers on an architecture built for the next decade, not the last. The Akamai Connected Cloud will put containers and VMs closer to end users and bring enterprise workloads to locations around the world that are otherwise difficult for organizations to reach. Customers are responding to Akamai's unique offering, and we've already gained cloud computing business across multiple verticals in every major geography, including a European streaming media company, a digital advertising company in Japan, a large financial institution in Indonesia, and e-commerce platform in Korea, major carriers in EMEA and Central America and a television network in South America. In addition to direct sales, we're seeing good traction in our cloud computing partner ecosystem, where we're acquiring new customers by selling with cloud service providers and managed service providers. We've also partnered successfully with independent software vendors and SaaS and PaaS providers. In fact, we recently signed one of the world's best-known SaaS providers and our second largest cloud computing deal since we acquired Lanone [ph] Turning now to content delivery. I'm pleased to report that we saw an acceleration of traffic growth in Q3. In addition, we acquired enterprise customer contracts from StackPath and Lumen Technologies following their decisions to exit the CDN market. As Ed will talk about shortly, the financial terms of the acquisitions were very attractive for Akamai shareholders. In addition to the delivery business that we acquired, we're planning to introduce these customers to our full portfolio of security and cloud computing solutions to help them power and protect their businesses online. In summary, we are very pleased by our performance in Q3. Our expanded security portfolio is deepening our relationships with customers. Our cloud computing plans are executing on schedule, and we continue to invest in Akamai's future growth while also enhancing our profitability. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our Q3 results and our outlook for Q4 and the full year. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. As Tom mentioned, Akamai delivered a strong and very profitable quarter in Q3. In my remarks today, I'll cover our Q3 results and then provide some perspective on Q4, share some details on our recent customer contract acquisitions and closed with our increased full year 2023 guidance. First, let's discuss revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter was $965 million, up 9% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. In the third quarter, Security revenue was $456 million, growing 20% year-over-year as reported and 19% in constant currency. Security revenue growth was primarily driven by continued strength in our segmentation product, which is now over $100 million on an annualized run rate basis and up 97% year-over-year. I'll note that during the quarter, we had approximately $6 million of onetime segmentation license revenue. Adjusting for that onetime license revenue, total security growth for the third quarter would have been 18% year-over-year as reported and 17% in constant currency. And segmentation revenue growth would have been approximately 62% year-over-year and 60% in constant currency. In addition to strength and segmentation, we also saw very strong growth in our flagship Web Application Firewall or WAF product family. This growth was primarily driven by stronger-than-expected adoption of new security bundles offered to new and existing customers that we introduced this year. The new security bundles include additional security entitlements such as more security policies, additional security configurations and more advanced rate control policies. Many existing customers are seeing greater value in these new bundles and as a result, are spending more with us. Moving to compute. Revenue was $130 million, growing 19% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. On a combined basis, our securities and compute business product lines represented 61% of total revenue, growing 20% year-over-year and 19% in constant currency. Shifting to delivery. Revenue was $379 million, declining 4% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. It's worth noting that delivery was aided by approximately $4 million in revenue from the selected CDN customer contracts we acquired from StackPath. International revenue was $467 million, up 11% year-over-year and up 9% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $3 million on a sequential basis and a positive $7 million benefit on a year-over-year basis. Moving now to company profitability. Non-GAAP net income was $251 million or $1.63 of earnings per diluted share, up 29% year-over-year and up 28% in constant currency. These especially strong EPS results exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.11. -- were driven primarily by higher revenues and continued progress on the cost savings initiatives we outlined over the last few quarters. As an example, we continue to reduce our third-party cloud spend by migrating internal workloads to our connected cloud platform. In Q3, our third-party cloud spend declined 26% year-over-year. Moving to margins. Our cash gross margin was 73%. Included in our Q3 cost of goods sold was approximately $5 million of transition services agreement or TSA costs paid to StackPath. With customer contract acquisitions, TSA payments are used to cover the seller's customer-related network and support costs during the migration period.\\ I'll provide further detail on expected TSA costs going forward in the guidance section in a few moments. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 43%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 31%, 2 points ahead of our guidance, driven by our revenue outperformance and continued focus on driving down costs across the business. Moving now to cash and our use of capital. As of September 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.1 billion, which includes the proceeds from the convertible debt raise we did during the quarter. As a reminder, in August, we issued $1.65 billion of senior unsecured convertible debt that will mature on February 15, 2029. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.125% per year payable semiannually. Finally, the net proceeds of approximately $1 billion from this offering have been invested in highly liquid marketable securities. These securities yield approximately 5.25% on a weighted average basis with maturities close to May 2025 as we intend to use these proceeds to pay off approximately $1.15 billion of convertible notes that mature in May 2025. We -- for the third quarter, we spent roughly $113 million to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares. We now have roughly $600 million remaining on our previously announced share buyback authorization. Our approach to capital allocation remains the same to opportunistically buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time while maintaining sufficient capital to deploy when strategic M&A presents itself. Before I cover Q4 guidance, I want to provide a quick reminder about our typical fourth quarter dynamics and add some color to our 2 recent transactions with StackPath and Lumen. As in prior year, seasonality plays a significant role in determining our financial performance for the fourth quarter. Typically, we see higher-than-normal traffic from large media customers and they pick up in seasonal online retail activity from our e-commerce customers. Both of these traffic patterns are difficult to predict. Q4 also tends to have higher operating expenses than in Q3, driven by higher sales commissions due to accelerator payments for sales reps who overachieved their annual quotas. As it relates to the transactions with StackPath and women's, first, both transactions were acquisitions of selected CDN customer contracts, including over 200 net new customers to Akamai. We did not acquire any other assets or liabilities at either company. Second, we expect the 2 transactions combined will add approximately $17 million to $20 million of revenue in Q4. Third, we expect to record approximately $13 million to $14 million of StackPath and lumen TSA costs in Q4. These costs will be recorded in our cost of goods sold and will have a negative impact of approximately 1 percentage point on gross margin, adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP operating margin. Combined, the stack path of lumen TSAs will negatively impact our Q4 EPS by approximately $0.06 to $0.07. We do not expect to incur any material TSA costs in 2024. And finally, our expectations for these customer acquisitions remain the same as we disclosed previously for the full year 2024. As a reminder, we expect the customer contracts acquired from StackPath to add approximately $20 million of revenue in 2024 and to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.03 to $0.05. And we expect the customer contracts acquired from women to add approximately $40 million to $50 million of revenue in 2024 and to be $0.08 to $0.12 accretive to non-GAAP EPS. With all that in mind, we are now projecting fourth quarter revenue in the range of $985 million to $1.005 billion or up 6% to 8% as reported and in constant currency over Q4 2022. We -- at current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $8 million impact on Q4 revenue compared to Q3 levels and a positive $2 million impact year-over-year. Taking into account the impact of the StackPath and Lumen TSAs for the fourth quarter, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 72%. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $305 million to $311 million. We expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 41%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $123 million to $125 million, and we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% for Q4. Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $143 million to $153 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the fourth quarter. This represents approximately 15% of our projected total revenue for the fourth quarter. Additionally, our CapEx guidance includes the integration requirements to support the traffic for both CDN customer contract acquisitions. Based on our expectations for revenue and costs, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be $1.57 to $1.62. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $50 million to $52 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we have increased revenue to a range of $3.802billion to $3.22 billion, which is up 5% to 6% year-over-year as reported and 6% in constant currency. At current spot rates, our guidance assumes foreign exchange will have a negative $18 million impact on revenue in 2023 on a year-over-year basis. We are raising our security revenue growth expectations to approximately 15% for the full year 2023, and we continue to expect to achieve approximately $0.5 billion in revenue from compute in 2023. And despite a year of significant investment, we are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29%. With all that in mind, we have raised our estimated non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to a range of $6.08 to $6.13. Our non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 17%, and a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Finally, our full year CapEx is expected to be 19% of total revenue. In closing, we are very pleased with how the business is performing in 2023 as we continue to invest for revenue growth and improve our profitability. With that, we now look forward to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from James Fish of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. James Fish : Really nice quarter there. Understanding you're selling Guardicore to the installed base primarily. But what are you seeing with selling outside of the installed base with security and compute and specifically within security. Is there a way to think about that drag along effect or how the Guardicore enterprise sales team are really dragging along the rest of the security or even compute portfolios into any net new customer wins. Really, the crux of the question is how is the sales process going outside of the CDN installed base? Ed McGowan : Jim, this is Ed. I'll start. Tom, you can jump in if there's anything you want to add. So actually, it's interesting, you started off by saying Guardicore is mostly to the installed base. Actually, we've done a really nice job of selling to new customers. One of the things that came over as part of the Guardicore acquisition is a pretty robust channel and pretty much every deal is done through the channel. As a matter of fact, I think we can do a better job of selling in the installed base and probably come up with some new incentives to incentivize the sales force to do that. So there's a ton of room in the installed base because most of the growth in Guardicore has come from outside the installed base. Tom Leighton : Yes. And I would just add to that, that there is good drag along with Guardicore and for example, Enterprise Application Access, one is considered north-south, the other East West, both are really important in terms of keeping malware out and identifying when it gets in and really blocking the spread. So it's good that way, too. James Fish : Helpful, guys. And just a follow-up, Tom, you had actually started to allude to it a little bit. But as we think about those lumen and Exacto [ph] contracts, I guess how much wallet share do you have in aggregate of these new customers? Or what's the overall opportunity for those specific customers beyond just that CDN revenue that you bought? Tom Leighton : Yes. Well, obviously, there's a CDN revenue, which is what transfers, but we're going to be looking to sell our security and compute solutions into those 200-plus new customers. And I think there's some good opportunity there. Operator : The next question is from Fatima Boolani of Citi. Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Tom, maybe I'll start with you. I want to have a broader conversation with regards to some of these contracts that you've been acquiring, it's setting up to be a little bit of a pattern. So look, you've been doing delivery for the better part of 2 decades here. So I wanted to get your kind of longitudinal perspective on what you're seeing in the marketplace and the market backdrop that's sort of pointing more and more towards consolidation in the delivery here. And then ultimately, I wanted to get your perspective on how you think this is going to impact some of the pricing dynamics and ultimately, your pricing power in the delivery space. And then I have a follow-up for Ed, if I may. Tom Leighton : Yes, I wouldn't call it a pattern. It's been a long time, really since we've acquired a competitor or a competitor contracts. This is a situation where 2 of the many CDNs out there decided to discontinue their operations. And they wanted -- now they're still remaining as companies, obviously, and they wanted to have their customers have the best possible experience as they exited the CDN space. And so they approached Akamai as the leader by far in CDN and made very compelling financial terms for the transaction. So it makes a lot of sense for our shareholders that we take on these customers. And also, it's a good opportunity as we mentioned, to sell them security and compute. So really good for shareholders. It's not something that we're actively doing trying to go buy other CDMs. But every once in a while, there is an opportunity that is compelling for shareholders. I don't see any fundamental change in the marketplace the hyperscalers and a dozen - 2 dozen other companies are selling delivery services. So I don't think there'll be any fundamental change there or change with pricing. Separately from this, of course, you know that we talked about Akamai as being more conservative with pricing, as we talked about, we're not taking some of the spiky traffic, if the pricing doesn't make sense because we've been focusing more on the capital deployment into our compute offering, which we see enormous potential future growth for... Fatima Boolani : Perfect. Thank you. Ed, I was hoping I could parse out some of your prepared remarks with respect to the third-party cloud spend that you're effectively in-sourcing. I believe a couple of quarters ago, you may have ballpark that figure at about $100 million. So please correct me if that recollection is correct. And also just wanted to get a sense of how far down the path you are in this in-sourcing of third-party cloud spend on your Connected Cloud platform. Thank you. Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. That's a great recollection, thought me you're correct. That's about $100 million or actually north of $100 million. So we are still in the earlier innings of the journey. However, we've made a lot of progress, and the team is doing a great job. So we expect to see that the savings continue to ramp. I'm very happy to say that we're slightly ahead of where we expected to be, and we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to drive the type of savings that we expect to throughout next year. Fatima Boolani : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Magellan Brooks [ph] of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking my question. Just want to dive into security a bit and see are the trends differing between international and domestic in terms of what products are getting better versus not? And then one follow-up question after that. Thanks. Tom Leighton : I don't think there's a fundamental difference. The attacks are global in nature and the same attacks we see here domestically. We see in pretty much all of the major geos. And yes, you do see a little bit more attacks where there's hotspots wars taking place or political tensions, there'll be more attacks, but the nature of the attacks is similar. You got a denial of service attacks, you got ransomware. You've got application layer attacks, more recently, AI attacks. So -- and that happens everywhere because there's no reason it should be in one geography versus another. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then for the Connected Cloud and just the compute segment as well, you guys talked about a lot of really nice international deals, but also just wanted to get a pulse on what's happening domestically and appetite for the products here. Tom Leighton : Again, I think that is universal as well. We'll have special advantages in locations where the hyperscalers aren't. But that kind of compute capability can be accessed by customers anywhere. Big U.S. companies care a lot about being able to give really good performance for their users all around the world. So again, I think that's -- there's not a fundamental difference between the U.S. or other regions. We have gotten off to a really good start, and I would say APJ, but it's across the board. We're deep in conversations with major enterprises across all the major geos. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Congrats. Operator : The next question is from Ray McDonough of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Ray McDonough : Thanks for taking the questions. And Ed, I appreciate the color on the additional bundles of security and the additional services you added to those bundles. And then in our conversations, we did pick up a decent price up with when those services are added. So can you help us understand what sort of pricing uplift, if any, there might be there? And what the penetration rate is in your installed base currently of those services and what the opportunity is going forward? Ed McGowan : Yes. So I'll start and then Tom, if there's anything you want to add. So this is a pretty targeted program that we identified customers in selected verticals primarily in commerce, manufacturing, health care, pharma, financial services, what we traditionally call sort of our legacy web customers. And as we have talked about, included a lot more services and functionality into the bundles. And upon renewal, we're able to upsell. And we're about -- this is probably 2,000 to 3,000 customers that fit into this sort of targeted group. We're probably about halfway through in terms of the customers that come up for renewal. If you remember, our customer -- average customer contract length is about 18 months. So this probably runs about 18 months to 2 years kind of a program, but we're very happy with what we're seeing with the average uplift on the average sale price. Ray McDonough : Great. And then maybe if I could, just on compute. Now that the majority of those core data centers are online. Can you talk about how much of the contracted space you filled out and what sort of utilization you're hoping to achieve as you enter 2024? I know you're not going to provide any sort of guidance here, but any sort of guidepost in terms of the actual capacity that will be online in '24 and what the compute pipeline looks like heading into next year to fill that capacity, it would be helpful just to understand kind of the capital needs of that business as we think about '24. Ed McGowan : Yes. In terms of the capital, we pretty much now done the major buildout. And of course, we're big consumers of that ourselves as we move our own applications in-house to Akamai Connected Cloud. And we've also got plenty of room to take on major enterprise business. So I don't think you'll see a lot of CapEx associated with the big core data centers until we start generating a lot more revenue from that. And then we would build out further. There'll probably be another couple that we do. What you will see is a relatively smaller amount of CapEx as we do build out into our existing Edge pops. And our goal is to start equipping them with compute so that you can run containers, VMs, Kubernetes and many more cities around the world. And so that -- and more cities than you can do that with, for example, the hyperscalers. And so that will be taking place over the course of the next year, but it's not a large amount of CapEx, so much smaller than what you saw this year. And then going from there, it will depend on how fast the revenue grows. So it will be a good news story if we're back next year saying that, okay, great, we fill that up, and now we're going to be building out some more. So it's a much better situation than we were in this year where there was a lot of build out getting ready and no revenue yet. Operator : The next question is from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. Can you give us some color on sort of the nature of the compute deals that you're getting now versus maybe 6 to 12 months ago? And then what have you learned by putting some of your own enterprise-level workloads on the compute platform that you've maybe been able to utilize as you sell to customers? And how has that process benefited the product? Tom Leighton : Yes. Good question. I would say you start going back 6-plus months ago, there really wasn't a lot of compute deals at that time because the Linode infrastructure really wasn't ready for it. There was some early experimentation. Now we're in a position where we really can take on mission-critical applications from big enterprises. We're starting to do that. Some are starting to grow very nicely. In terms of the learnings, we've learned a lot. I would say on the good news side, we're saving a lot of money. And we're going to help our customers save a lot of money. We're also seeing really good performance and better in many cases than we can get with the hyperscalers. And as we go forward, we'll get -- we, of course, have better scalability in terms of faster scalability. And for Akamai, that's really important because we have a lot of customers that have flash crowds, peak events and so forth, Hard to predict how big they'll be. And with our deployed platform, we're really good at that, of course, with security and with delivery. And now we're applying those capabilities to compute so that we can spin up more compute instances in a faster, more responsive way. So we're very happy consumers of our own cloud. Now on the other side, we've learned that it's not just flip a switch. And you just don't flip a switch and suddenly you're off the hyperscaler and you're on to Akamai. And of course, that's true when you move from any cloud environment into another one, it does take some effort to do it, but it is well, well worth it. And we're so a great reference, and we can now help our customers and our partners. We're working with many partners in cloud so that they can take their customers and get them on to Akamai Connected Cloud. Operator : Next question is from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Tim Horan : Staying on that point, can you maybe just talk about the backlog and customer interest at this point? Just any update, it sounds like it's going well. Also, where are you kind of all the value-added services and tools? And I just -- maybe just a complete cloud portfolio at this point? And then lastly, could you just remind us what the margins of this business will look like longer term? And I guess we do get asked a lot like why can you sell this cheaper than the cloud providers, I guess, at the end of the day? And will that impact your margins? Tom Leighton : Okay. A lot of components there. I'll start with some of them and then probably Ed will fill in with some. Yes, we're in a lot of really good conversations, as you can imagine, because the world's major media companies, gaming companies, commerce companies all use Akamai. They had for many, many years. They trust us for scale, reliability, performance, they trust us with security. They trust us not to compete with them. And as they see what we're building in terms of compute, they like the idea of getting better performance, more distributed compute capabilities. And some of those folks really like the idea of a much lower price point. And as an extra benefit, especially if you're in media or commerce, it's getting to be a bigger problem that they're cutting such giant checks to their leading competitor and sharing all the crown jewels of their data with their leading competitor. So they're taking the Akamai solution with great interest, I would say. Now in terms of being cheaper, Akamai has been for a long time, the world's most distributed platform. We run one of the world's largest backbones. We have worked for many, many years to be incredibly efficient in terms of moving data around and doing the delivery. And that gives us a real advantage of being able to do this now for compute in a very cost-effective way. Now that said, I am sure that the hyperscalers pay a little bit less for their hardware than we do, probably not a lot less, maybe a little less. But when it comes to everything else, I think Akamai is in an excellent position. And what we're seeing in the marketplace is that they'll get their best offer from the hyperscalers, and we can be a lot lower than that and be very profitable at doing it. And the good news, I think, for Akamai is that here you've got a $10-plus billion market growing at 20% a year. And we're a tiny guy there compared to the hyperscalers. So we can operate at a level that is not threatening to them in any way. They got to worry about each other. And there's plenty of room for us to take on a lot of revenue at lower price points and very good margins for Akamai. Now in terms of the marketplace, that's an area, obviously, with the hyperscalers are way ahead some of those folks, every application ever made is available in the marketplace. -- as a managed service, we are growing our marketplace. We are growing the tools that are available on Akamai Connected Cloud. And the first applications that we're targeting are applications that are more easily able to be cloud agnostic, that are not locked in, that aren't using 20 other applications in the marketplace. And so that we are much easier to port onto Akamai Connected Cloud. And so there are some applications that won't be able to report in the near term. But we don't need all those applications. All we need is to get going as a tiny share of that market. And we've identified just, for example, in the media vertical alone, there's a lot of applications that are amenable to moving to our platform. And of course, a lot of our partners in our marketplace to begin with our media-related companies, for that reason because they're also threatened by the hyperscalers, and they're very excited about having media applications beyond Akamai. Ed, do you want to add anything there? Ed McGowan : Yes. Just a couple of things. Yes, Tom talked a little bit about the leverage we have with the backbone, but we also have a lot of other leverage in the company with our go-to-market, where the focus is going to be initially with our installed base. As Tom talked about in media to start, there's a tremendous amount. We pretty much work with every major brands. So there's a lot of leverage from that perspective. Also the people that build and deploy the network are the same people who are building and deploying our CDN network. -- and we're getting leverage with our co-location vendors and things like that. So we -- I've seen some pretty large proposals go out that get us margins that are pretty similar to the company margins in terms of gross margins that are somewhere between security and delivery and operating margins that potentially could be even greater as we get scale to the bottom line. So there's an enormous amount of margins. If you think of the math that we're doing with how much we're saving, the amount of capital that we're deploying and the cost, we're going to be saving a tremendous amount of money on moving our own applications, and we'll be able to offer some of that to our customers as well. Operator : The next question is from Alex Henderson of Needham & Company. Alex Henderson : Great. I'm rather than astounded that we haven't heard the word AI, so far in this conference call, at least I don't think we have. So can you talk a little bit about the impact of AI in terms of your opportunity to bring it to compute? Is it something that you think you can bring to the edge piece? Or is to run on your security -- our CDN Edge. And alternatively, is at a risk in the sense that InferenceI is going to be distributed, but a lot of the compute process might be more centralized in that context, diminish the willingness of people to move applications to your compute. So how do I think about the - the infant AI opportunity and the risk of customers being more challenges in moving. Tom Leighton : Okay. Great question. In fact, there's a lot of components to this one, too. At a high level, there's a lot of potential opportunity, I would say. But let me step back just a minute. Akamai has been using AI and machine learning in our products for a long, long time. Obviously, useful for anomaly detection, bot detection, when an entity is accessing their bank account with the right credentials. Is it the right person or not detecting that malware has infected an application inside an enterprise. Lots of ways that we've been using AI and machine learning. Now with Gen AI, I think it helps some, but it really helps the attack. It's much easier now to morph malware into a lot of different forms, makes it harder to detect. Our teams have created some very nasty bots very quickly using Gen AI. And I think we're already seeing more penetration as a result of Gen AI. That's one area where really it is being actively used today. Now on that side of the house, the implications are -- there's more risk in terms of cybersecurity for enterprises. They're going to get penetrated more. And so you really have to double down on your defense and depth. I think it makes products like [indiscernible] segmentation even more critical because you're going to get penetrated, the key is to identify it quickly and proactively block the spread. And that -- I think when you look at our growth rate there, very, very hot with a market-leading solution. Now you also asked about what about compute and the impact of Gen AI there? I do think over time, it will suck up a lot more compute. And that's good for vendors selling compute, like Akamai sales compute. And you're right, there's a difference between the generation of the model, which is -- if they're large models, very heavy, and that will be done in core compute and storage data centers. inference engines can run at the edge and will make sense to run at the edge for many applications. And we already have several partners that are porting their AI models on to Akamai for inference engines -- and so -- and I expect that they will be selling that in our marketplace to other companies. And so in fact, we're already in a sense, using AI as we put our internal applications on to Akamai Connected Cloud. So I think you will see, over time, a lot of revenue generated there because of all the uses that I think will come about through AI. Now you ask about risk. I think you will need -- you do the model generation in the big data centers. That's not a risk for Akamai because we've got 2 dozen of those today. So that's -- it's just to be done in a different place. It won't be done at the edge. But inference engines, yes, a lot of that work will be done at the edge, and we're in a great place there because other companies don't have an edge, anything like Akamai.. Operator : Next question is from Abdul Khan of Evercore. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : This is Dua speaking for Abdul. And I just wanted to ask for you broadly on the enterprise spend environment. And I know we've previously we've noted elongating sales cycles. And I was just generally curious whether there's any change there. And if you had to characterize it, is enterprise IT spend incrementally worse or better or about the same versus, let's say, 90 days ago? Tom Leighton : Yes. Good question. I would say, I think there's a lot of companies that are being cautious. We have seen a slight uptick in bankruptcies as you typically would see in cycle like this. But we're not seeing a significant impact certainly in our security business. If anything, we've seen better-than-expected results there. So I think security is not as impacted, at least at the moment. Obviously, there's a lot of speculation out there that we're heading towards a recession and things can change pretty quickly. But so far, we fared very well. And also, if you think about our messaging around compute, one of the biggest challenges a lot of companies have is the runaway cost of compute, and we offer a very compelling option for people to look to save money and increase their performance by moving to us. So I think that will play into our favor in an environment like this. Operator : Next question is from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Ed, how noticeable or how sudden is the increase that you're seeing and the sophistication of all these mallware and ransomware attacks. The part of why I was asking is we noticed that you're launching some scrubbing centers in Canada. And I'm wondering if that's driving CapEx a little higher to help make sure that you're able to address all these attacks. And then I have a quick follow-up. Tom Leighton : Yes, let me just start on the product side, and then Ed will pick up your questions. So ransomware isn't related to scrubbing centers. scrubbing centers are just restricting the flow of packets and screening out or scrubbing out the packets that are trying to flood any particular resource. And that's nothing really per se to do with malware and ransomware to filter that out, you need application layer defenses where the scrubbing centers are routing layer defenses. And putting the scrubbing centers in Canada, and we're actually putting scrubbing centers in many more cities around the world and greatly increasing our capacity so that with local customers there, we can do the scrubbing for them locally. And that gives them better performance while we're giving them the defense against the volumetric attacks. For ransomware, you need Gardicor for malware, you need app and API security. And those are different products where they're done at our edge network in the 4,000 POPs, EdgePops we have around the world. And then, Ed, do you want to pick up the other part of that? Tom Leighton : Yes, sure. Usually, the -- as Tom mentioned, the building of the scrubbing center generally will follow where we see significant demand from customers. And one of the other reasons security is up a bit this year as we have seen an increase in some of these volumetric attacks in the health care sector, a little bit in the financial sector as well. So this is pretty ordinary course for us. So in terms of like the CapEx needs or builds going forward, I'd say this is just ordinary course -- there's really nothing unusual to call out there, but we have seen a bit of a pickup in DDoS, in particular, tends to be a bit more episodic as you see big headline grabbing attacks. We do tend to see a pickup in business. And oftentimes, that will include a scrubbing center build. But they're pretty well informed with where we're seeing increased demand. Mark Murphy : Okay. Understood. And then, Ed, just as a follow-up, did you mention what was the total consideration paid for the acquired contracts from StackPath in Lumin? I'm wondering, I believe those are expected to contribute something like $60 million to $70 million next year in aggregate. Is that -- are you taking -- like are you assuming a similar ongoing run rate that those contracts had with the prior providers and extrapolating that into next year? Or are you contemplating into that any kind of expansion, contraction, right, or pricing that up or pricing that lower? Tom Leighton : Sure. Let me start -- I'll take it in different pieces here. So in terms of anticipating any upsell or anything like that with the 200-plus customers, I haven't factored anything in for that. So that would be upside to the extent that we can do that. Remember, we purchased selected contracts. There are certain contracts that we did not take. There's, for example, adult content and some of the small medium business customer contracts we didn't take. So that's not included. So if you're looking at other numbers that you may have heard about these companies are private, I'd just caution anybody with private company numbers and other is accurate. We just looked at the contracts that we're acquiring, what we think will -- how many will onboard, what will happen with pricing, how much traffic we'll keep some of these customers are splitters, so we anticipate some of that traffic may go away. But we've tried to factor all that in. So what we're trying to do effectively is look at the other side of the integration in terms of the contracts that we acquired, what is that run rate of business that we acquired taking into consideration the best we can, volume and pricing dynamics. In terms of consideration, we'll file our 10-Q tomorrow, and you'll see that for STACK PAT, that contract has got an upfront fee of about $35 million, and there's a small earnout. Also with the TSA agreement, a little wonky accounting here for you, but you have to fair value the TSA and to the extent that there's excess cost there that goes to the purchase price. So when you see the final 10-K once it's filed and the cash flow, the numbers may be slightly higher. On the lumen, it's about $75 million. There is no earnout there. Same comments on the TSA. There is a fair value analysis you do in purchase accounting. So that might be slightly higher. But that's the extent of the agreements. Operator : The next question is from Rishi Jaluria of RBC. Rishi Jaluria : One wanted to follow up on 2 earlier questions that were asked, one on AI and then one on the contracts. Thinking specifically around AI, Tom, I appreciate your answer earlier. If we think about the opportunity to do inferencing at the edge, especially for cases like connecting devices or med tech or financial services now that people are increasingly worried about data and data residency. Can you speak to a little bit of your opportunity for that? And maybe alongside that, what investments do you need to make both in the software stack as well as in hardware infrastructure, be it GPUs or anything else to really capitalize and get your fair share of that opportunity? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Tom Leighton : Great. Yes, the data residency, data sovereignty issues are increasingly important, as I imagine you know, -- and that's where Akamai has a great opportunity because we're in 130 different countries with our infrastructure. And as we move compute into our edge pops, that enables us to do the work locally, keep the data local, which is an exciting opportunity for us. And I think in the not-too-distant future, we'll be in locations and countries that even the hyperscalers aren't there. Now in terms of the work on the software stack to be able to do that, that is ongoing work now. We are actually already in beta with a few customers -- so we're pretty far along. And then next year, as I mentioned, there'll be relatively small amount of CapEx as we do build out in a nontrivial number of our edge pops to be able to support compute. Now today, at the edge, I don't -- we support GPUs today, but that would be more in the core data centers. I think for the inference engines, we're running that just fine on CPUs. And so as we look at the edge, where you'd be running the inference engines, I don't, I think, run on CPUs and be much more cost-effective than trying to buy GPUs or custom hardware there. I think where you might see that as more if you're working with large-scale model development. And then that would be in the core data centers. That wouldn't be at the edge. The edge is where you want to do the inferencing. And that's -- it seems like that's going to be working very well on our edge platform with CPUs. Rishi Jaluria : Got it. That's really helpful. And then just in terms of the StackPath and Lumen contracts, again, I appreciate the color in terms of your set of assumptions. Can you walk us through what you can do on your part to ensure those customers, whether they're net new or existing Akamai customers that maybe we're trying to use a multi-CDN approach, what you can do to get those customers to stay and to not turn off on to other competitors or even just kind of figure out how to reduce the peaty. Tom Leighton : Yes. Good question. I think first is the approach that we took, right? We got an inbound request from these 2 companies, and some of them are customers we know and have had a long relationship with. And providing an orderly transition is step 1 in the relationship, right? So now you get a warm relationship and introduction to it's a new customer, and certainly, for the customers that we have. They obviously know us -- and you get -- instead of having a jump ball in the open market, you have a chance to sit down with the customer and understand what their needs are, understand what's going on with their contracts, length of contracts, pricing, et cetera. And you could just set up a relationship and just go through a normal sales cycle effectively. I think we've got a pretty good track record, and I'm certainly understanding the customers. And if I think about sort of the weighted average of where the revenue is, we've obviously gone and talked to a lot of those customers. We obviously have had a long-term relationship with a lot of these folks. So I think we have a fairly high degree of confidence in the numbers that we've put out. Obviously, things can change. But based on our experience with a lot of these folks and with some of these new folks that we have not worked with us in the past, we have an awful lot of other services to offer that they didn't have before. And especially with security being such a big topic these days. We're hearing from some of these customers that they're glad that they have a relationship with us now. Operator : The next question is from Ruby Kessinger of D.A. Davidson. Ruby Kessinger : Ed, I just want to quantify the TSA impact. It seems to be about 1.5 points impact cash gross margins in Q4. Is that accurate? And just to be clear, it sounds like that, that TSA ends at year-end? Or when exactly does that TSA add? Tom Leighton : Yes. So there might be just a tiny bit that goes into Q1 just depending on how the migration goes. Hopefully, we can be done with it by the next couple of months. Yes, it's just under 1.5 points. I rounded down to a point, but you're right. If you just take the amount divided by the revenue, it's about 1.3%, 1.4%. Ruby Kessinger : Okay. Got it. And then if I just look at your delivery guidance, which, I guess, is implied by your compute security revenue guidance, and then I back out the expected $17 million to $20 million of revenue from Lumin and StackPath in Q4, it implies delivery revenue flat to down in Q4 versus Q3. So is any extra conservatism in the Q4 delivery guide just based on what you're seeing from traffic trends or any pricing pressure to call out? Or why not -- why aren't we seeing a typical seasonal Q4 uplift in delivery revenue ex those acquisitions. Tom Leighton : Yes. That's a good question. First of all, there's $4 million of delivery in the Q4 number so that you have to look at the net delta between the 2. Also, there's about an $8 million headwind from FX. So there is some implied growth in the delivery number. As I talked about there's a high degree of uncertainty in Q4 as it relates to traffic, right? You've got -- typically, we see a big seasonality in terms of retail and the media side of the business. Retail as we've gone to 0 overage is less impactful. We do still see some bursting. I think we're being probably a bit more cautious, especially on the commerce side of the equation for now. But there is some implied growth in there as you factor in those other 2 items I just mentioned. Ruby Kessinger : Okay. That's helpful. Operator : The next question is from William Power of Baird. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : This is Yan Simoes on for Will. So first of all, just looking at delivery, how are you thinking about Q4 delivery trends this year versus normal seasonality given all the questions around the consumer and media activity in general? Any color there would be great. Tom Leighton : Yes. As I just mentioned on the last question that we're probably a bit more cautious in terms of our outlook certainly with retail. I mentioned earlier in an earlier question that we've seen an uptick in bankruptcies. We do have a lot of customers that are on the 0 overage for commerce. So we're going into disease. We haven't seen it yet. It usually starts right after Thanksgiving. We're just being a bit more cautious. And in terms of the media cycle, -- we did see a little bit of gaming activity. Gaming has been light for the last 1.5 years. A couple of years ago, we saw a big console refresh cycle. We don't -- not expected to see that. So I'd say we're going into this quarter, probably a bit more cautious than we normally have in Q4 and certainly what we've seen in the past. Operator : The next question is from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Michael Elias : First, earlier you talked about portability, particularly for cloud-agnostic workloads. I guess my question for you is, as you think about moving and garnering more share here, what are the steps that you could do to pretty much increase the ease of portability of workloads? And as part of that, through your data center deployments, do you have essentially direct cross connect into the cloud on ramps of the major cloud providers to essentially help facilitate the movement of workloads to your platform? And then I have a quick follow-up. Tom Leighton : Yes. Great question. I think partners are really helpful there because they do a lot of the work in the first place to get into the third-party cloud provider. And today, some of them move between third-party cloud providers. And so there is a natural partner ecosystem that can be helpful porting that to Akamai. And I think they're finding that the terms are even more favorable for them as well as for the partners. Also, as we grow the ecosystem of third-party capabilities, which with our qualified compute partner program we're doing early focus on media there, which is our initial focus in terms of applications to move to Akamai. And yes, what it depends on the data center and the third-party cloud provider, but we do have direct connections in many cases. And of course, we operate, as I mentioned, one of the world's largest backbones and in a position to also make direct connections to major enterprises, which can help quite a bit. And then just as a quick follow-up. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about the M&A environment that you're seeing. I know you have that your security growth guidance that you gave at your Analyst Day, which includes some M&A. Just curious, any thoughts around the M&A environment, particularly for security? And maybe as part of that, just comments on valuation. Yes, valuations in the companies that we're most interested in are still extremely high. And you see some of the recent acquisitions that have been done at very high revenue multiples. So not a lot of change yet. Probably at the fringes, it's getting harder. But for companies that we have an interest in, I'd not say it's made a lot of improvement yet. That may change with time. We just have to see. It's something we keep a close eye on. Of course, we're always looking, but we're very disciplined buyers. So it really has to make very good sense for our customers and for our shareholders. Operator, we have time for one more, please. Operator : The last question is from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig Hallum. Jeff Van Rhee : Just one quick one on compute, Kind of getting to the inflection or the acceleration in growth. I have a couple of questions. Just on sales cycles there, refractory, what is the typical sales cycle for a compute deal? And then secondly, with the bulk of the build-out done, and it sounds like functionality isn't the limiter, then it's really just getting to maturity of these sales cycles. The sales force has trained the functionalities there, the infrastructure is there. So it looks like Q4 builds in organic growth roughly similar to Q3. So just trying to get a sense of timing of acceleration there. Tom Leighton : Yes. Good question. There is the sales cycle. But when you close the deal, then there's the effort to actually port it and then the time to grow it. And so it's not like maybe one of a normal service or sell delivery were very quick to to port the business and turn it up. It can -- that can happen in a period of days to weeks. Here, probably it's more months to actually get the app corded. And then all the traffic or all the compute won't move over all at once. You wouldn't be growing it over time. So it will -- this is something you'll see, I think, throughout next year as we close customers and then we grow their revenue. And the early signings we did this year, that's exactly what we're seeing, initially very small amounts of revenue, relatively speaking, and then grows over time. Jeff Van Rhee : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at a number of investor conferences and events throughout the rest of the year. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of Rockmy.con. Again, thank you for joining us, and all of us here at Akamai wish you and yours a wonderful rest of the year. Have a nice evening. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.+",

As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Before I turn the call over to Tom, I\u2019d like to let everyone know that I have transitioned to Head of Akamai\u2019s investor roles to Mark Stoutenberg. Many of you have met Mark over the past year, and I'm confident you will find him extremely helpful about all things Akamai. I'll be moving into another role internally, and want to thank Tom personally for bringing me into the Akamai culture 10 years ago. It's been a privilege to work with so many wonderful people, both here at Akamai, and of course, all of you externally. I wish you all happiness and good fortune. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Tom. And thank you very much for the terrific job that you've done over the last 10 years at Akamai. It's truly been a pleasure working with you. And I'd like to join you in welcoming Mark as your successor. Turning now to our Q4 results, I'm pleased to report that ACMI delivered a strong finish to a very successful 2023. Fourth quarter revenue grew to $995 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $1.69, up 23% year-over-year, and up 22% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $3.81 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. Full year non-GAAP earnings per share was $6.20, up 15% year-over-year, and up 16% in constant currency. Security revenue in Q4 grew 17% year-over-year, and was up 18% in constant currency, contributing nearly half of our total revenue in the quarter. Security growth was driven in part by continued strong demand for our market-leading Guardicore Segmentation Solution, as more enterprises relied on Akamai to defend against malware and ransomware. Customers who purchased Segmentation in Q4 included one of the largest global tech firms in India, and a leading payment systems company based in Hong Kong that handles 15 million transactions a day. We've also seen strong interest in our new API Security Solution that we announced in August. Early adopters of this new solution include three major financial institutions, several major retail brands in Europe and North America, and a leading industrial automation company in Europe. Our customers are seeing the value of this new capability with several already paying over half $0.5 million per year for the service. Akamai\u2019s API Security Solution also earned recognition from industry analysts in Q4. KuppingerCole named Akamai an overall industry leader in their API security and management leadership compass report. And Gartner validated our strong and expanded API capabilities in its market guide for cloud, web application and API protection. Turning now to cloud computing, I'm pleased to say that we accomplished what we set out to achieve last year in terms of infrastructure deployment, product development, jumpstarting our partner ecosystem, onboarding the first mission critical apps from some major enterprise customers, and achieving substantial cost savings as we moved our own applications from hyperscalers to the Akamai Connected Cloud. After launching Akamai Connected Cloud. After launching Akamai Connected Cloud last year, we rolled out 14 new core computing regions around the world, giving us a total of 25 overall. We also enhanced our cloud compute offering by doubling the capacity of our object storage solution and adding premium instances for large commercial workloads that are designed to deliver consistent performance with predictable resource and cost allocation. Also, our Akamai Global Load Balancer is now live. This integrated service is designed to route traffic requests to the optimal data center to minimize latency and ensure no single point of failure. Last year, we also amplified our go-to-market approach with our cloud computing partner program. The collaborative nature of the program provides a unique model for Akamai to engage with customers at a consultative level to deeply understand their requirements and pain points and to provide a complete solution leveraging the combined strength of the partner\u2019s technology and Akamai's distributed compute platform. We've already partnered with several leading SaaS and PaaS providers and cloud data and processing platforms. We're very pleased with the progress that we've made thus far and are looking forward to adding more new partnerships in 2024. We've also begun to gain traction with some of our largest customers as they migrate mission-critical apps onto our cloud platform. For example, one of the world's best-known social media platforms spent approximately $5 million on computing services with us last year and they're already on a run rate to do more than double that this year. Two of the world's best-known software companies recently signed on and are already spending about a quarter of a million dollars per month on cloud computing with Akamai. In Q4, we also signed up a major global media measurement and analytics company and we displaced a hyperscaler when we signed Blu TV, the largest VOD streaming company in Turkey. The streaming customer told us that they found our platform to be simple to use, automated and intuitive, cloud agnostic for a smooth multi-cloud migration and affordable with very low egress cost, all backed by a trusted and reliable partner. In addition to exceeding our full-year cloud computing revenue goal of $500 million last year, we also derived significant cost savings by migrating several of our own applications from hyperscalers to Akamai Connected Cloud. Our bot manager and enterprise application access solutions were among the first to migrate. Together, these products are used by over 1,000 customers and they generate over $300 million in annual revenue for Akamai. But all that is just the beginning. Today, we're excited to announce the next phase of our multi-year strategy to transform the cloud marketplace, taking cloud computing to the edge by embedding cloud computing capabilities into Akamai's massively distributed edge network. Akamai's new initiative, codenamed Gecko which stands for \u201cGeneralized Edge Compute\u201d, combines the computing power of our cloud platform with the proximity and efficiency of the edge to put workloads closer to users than any other cloud provider. Traditional cloud providers support virtual machines and containers in a relatively small number of core data centers. Gecko is designed to extend this capability to our edge pops, bringing full stack computing power to hundreds of previously hard-to-reach locations. Deploying our cloud computing capabilities into Akamai's worldwide edge platform will also enable us to take advantage of existing operational tools, processes, and observability, enabling developers to innovate across the entire continuum of compute and providing a consistent experience from centralized cloud to distributed edge. Nobody else in the marketplace does this today. In the latest implementation phase that we're announcing today, Akamai aims to embed compute with support for virtual machines into about 100 cities by the end of the year. We've deployed new Gecko-architected regions in four countries already, as well as in cities that lack a concentrated hyperscaler presence. These initial locations are listed in today's press release. Following that, we plan to add support for containers. And then, we plan to develop automated workload orchestration to make it easier for developers to build applications across hundreds of distributed locations. We've been conducting early trials of Gecko with several of our enterprise customers that are eager to deliver better experiences for their customers by running workloads closer to users, devices, and sources of data. Their early feedback has been very encouraging, as they evaluate Gecko for tasks such as AI inferencing, deep learning for recommendation engines, data analytics, multiplayer gaming, accelerating banking transactions, personalization for e-commerce, and a variety of media workflow applications, such as transcoding. In short, I'm incredibly excited for the prospects of Gecko as we move full stack compute to the edge. Turning now to content delivery, I'm pleased to report that Akamai remains the market leader by a wide margin, providing the scale and performance required by the world's top brands as we help them deliver reliable, secure, and near flawless online experiences. Our delivery business continues to be an important generator of profit that we use to develop new products to fuel Akamai's future growth. And it's an important driver of our security and cloud computing businesses, as we harvest the competitive and cost advantages of offering delivery, security, and compute on the same platform as a bundle. As we've noted in past calls, we're selective when it comes to less profitable delivery opportunities. And this is a discipline that we intend to maintain, and in some cases, increase in 2024. To be clear, we still aim to be the best in delivery for our customers. And we believe that our disciplined approach will benefit our business by allowing us to focus more of our investment in security and cloud computing, which are now approaching two thirds of Akamai's revenue and growing at a rapid rate. In summary, we're pleased to have accomplished what we said we would do in 2023. Our cloud computing plans are taking shape as we envisioned. Our expanded security portfolio is enabling us to deepen our relationships with customers. And we continue to invest in Akamai's future growth while also enhancing our profitability. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our results and our outlook for Q1 and 2024. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. I would also like to thank Tom Barth for his incredible service for 10 years as our head of investor relations. Now moving on to our results, let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with our fiscal 2023 year results, delivering $6.20 of non-GAAP earnings per share, capping off a year of double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders. Today I'll cover our Q4 results, provide some color regarding 2024, including some items to help investors better understand a few factors that will impact our upcoming results, and then close with our Q1 and full year 2024 guidance, starting with revenue. Q4 revenue was $995 million, up 7% year-over-year as reported and in cost and currency. We saw continued strong growth in our compute and security businesses during the fourth quarter. Our compute business grew to $135 million, up 20% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. We continue to be very pleased with the feedback regarding our cloud compute offerings, and we are very optimistic about the early traction we are seeing from enterprise customers. Moving to security, revenue was $471 million, growing 18% year-over-year and up 17% in constant currency. Our security revenue continues to be driven by strong growth in our Guardicore Segmentation Solution, in our industry leading web app firewall, denial of service, and bot management solutions. In addition, and as Tom mentioned, we are encouraged by the early traction of our new API security solution. During the fourth quarter, we signed 17 API security customers, including 4 with annual contract values in excess of $500,000 per year. Our delivery revenue was $389 million, including approximately $20 million from the contracts we recently acquired from StackPath and Lumen. International revenue was $479 million, up 8% year-over-year, or up 6% in constant currency, representing 48% of total revenue in Q4. Finally, foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a sequential basis and a positive $6 million benefit on a year-over-year basis. Moving to profitability. In Q4, we generated strong non-GAAP net income of $263 million, or $1.69 of earnings per diluted share, up 23% year-over-year or 22% in constant currency, and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance range. These stronger-than-expected EPS results were driven primarily by continued progress on the cost-saving initiatives we have previously outlined, and approximately $6 million in lower-than-expected transition services, or TSA costs, associated with the StackPath and Lumen contracts, as our services organization migrated the customers onto our platform much faster than we expected. Q4 CapEx was $143 million, or just below 15% of revenue. We were very pleased with our continued focus on lowering the capital intensity of our delivery business. This effort, along with our very strong profitability, enabled us to deliver very strong free cash flow results in Q4. Moving to our capital allocation strategy, during the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $55 million to buy back approximately 500,000 shares. For the full year, we spent approximately $654 million to buy back approximately 8 million shares. We ended 2023 with approximately $500 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Going forward, our intention is to continue buying back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time, and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases. Before I move on to guidance, there are several items that I want to highlight in order to give investors some greater insight into the business. The first relates to our delivery revenue. In the first half of 2024, seven of our top 10 CDN customers' contracts come up for renewal. As we've discussed in the past, this type of renewal generally leads to an initial drop in revenue, and then we typically see revenue grow again as traffic increases over time. We have factored the expected outcome of these renewals into our Q1 and full year 2024 guidance. In addition, as Tom mentioned, we plan to continue to optimize our delivery business by focusing on how we charge certain high-volume traffic customers for their usage on our network, all with an eye on profitability. For example, we plan to start charging a premium for higher-cost delivery destinations. We expect to continue to optimize the ratio of peak to day-to-day traffic, and we plan to negotiate different pricing for API traffic versus download traffic. Choosing to shed some less profitable traffic will result in a more balanced and profitable approach to pricing, which we believe is the right strategy for the company. Second, OECD member countries continue to work toward the enactment of a 15% global minimum corporate tax rate. And in particular, in December 2023, the Swiss Federal Council declared the rules in effect for Switzerland beginning in 2024. As a result, we anticipate that our non-GAAP effective tax rate will increase by roughly 1.5 to 2 percentage points, to approximately 18.5% to 19%. We estimate this increase in our tax rate will have a negative impact on Q1 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share, and a negative impact on full year non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.12 to $0.15 per diluted share. The impact of this tax rate change has been factored into our Q1 and full year 2024 guidance. Third, we expect to generate significantly more free cash flow in 2024 compared to 2023 levels. This is primarily due to much lower capital expenditures in 2024, along with our continued focus on profitability. Please note that the full cost to build out our Gecko compute sites we announced earlier today is included in our Q1 and full year 2024 capital expenditure guidance. Fourth, I want to remind you of the typical seasonality we experience on the top and bottom lines throughout the year. Regarding revenue, the fourth quarter is usually our strongest quarter. Regarding profitability, in Q1 we incur much higher payroll taxes related to the reset of Social Security taxes for employees who maxed out during 2023, and from stock vesting for employee equity programs, which tend to be more heavily concentrated in the first quarter. It's also worth noting that in Q3, our annual company-wide merit-based salary increases go into effect, so we tend to see higher operating costs in Q3 compared to Q2 levels. Finally, for 2024, we anticipate heightened volatility in foreign currency markets, driven by the unpredictable timing and magnitude of Federal Reserve policy changes and their impact on interest rates. With this in mind, forecasting the trajectory of FX in the latter part of the year poses a formidable challenge. Thus, for the full year, we plan to provide annual revenue growth, security and compute revenue growth, non-GAAP EPS growth, non-GAAP operating margin, and CapEx only in constant currency based on 1231-2023 exchange rates. However, for the coming quarter, we will provide both as reported and constant currency guidance. As a reminder, we have approximately $1.2 billion of annual revenue that is generated from foreign currency with the Euro, Yen, and Great British Pound being the largest non-U.S. dollar sources of revenue. In addition, our costs in non-U.S. dollars tend to be significantly lower than our revenue and are primarily in Indian rupee, Israeli shekel, and Polish Zloty. Moving now to guidance. Our guidance for 2024 assumes no material changes, good or bad, in the current macroeconomic landscape. For the first quarter of 2024, we are projecting revenue in the range of $980 million to $1 billion, or up 7% to 9% as reported, or 8% to 10% in constant currency over Q1 2023. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $2 million impact on Q1 revenue compared to Q4 levels and a negative $4 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margin of approximately 73% as reported and in constant currency. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $305 million to $310 million. We anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of approximately 42% to 43% as reported and in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense of $127 million to $129 million. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% to 30% as reported and in constant currency for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.59 to $1.64, or up 14% to 18% as reported, and 16% to 19% in constant currency. The EPS guidance assumes taxes of $56 million to $58 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18.5% to 19%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Moving on to CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $146 million to $154 million excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the first quarter. This represents approximately 15% of total revenue. Looking ahead to the full year for 2024, we expect revenue growth of 6% to 8% in constant currency. We expect security revenue growth of approximately 14% to 16% in constant currency. We expect compute revenue growth to be approximately 20% in constant currency. And we're estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% in constant currency. And full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 15% of total constant currency revenue, which again includes the Gecko compute buildup. We expect our CapEx to be roughly broken down as follows. Approximately 3% of revenue for our delivery and security business, approximately 4% of revenue for compute, approximately 7% of revenue for capitalized software, and the remainder for IT and facility related spend. We expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth of 7% to 11% in constant currency. And as we mentioned earlier, this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18.5% to 19%, and a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. In closing, we are very pleased with a strong finish to 2023. We continue to be excited about our growth prospects and driving profitability across the business. Now Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Fatima Boolani of Citi. Please go ahead. Fatima Boolani : Thank you for taking my questions. Ed, I wanted to drill into the delivery, the segment performance and the guidance and some of the modeling points that you shared with us. I was hoping you could parse out for us some of the organic traffic trends you saw on the platform, parsed away from the traffic, from the acquired contracts between StackPath and Lumen. And then to the extent you can talk about any timeframe you have with regards to absorbing some of this additional acquired traffic from these contracts. And the last piece of the question here is also the guidance that we calculated to be down 6% for delivery in 2024, implied by your guidance, full year guidance. Can you talk to what proportion of that traffic that you would have deemed lower quality being peeled off is maybe the reason why we're not seeing a more sharper improvement in the delivery franchise. And then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you. Ed McGowan : All right, sure. Let me see if I can tackle all those for you. I'll start with the performance in Q4. So I'll break it down into a couple of buckets. So in Q4, we tend to see a stronger seasonal quarter for us. And we did see some of that. So from the retail customer perspective, we saw bursting roughly to the tune of about half of what we saw last year. And I think that has to do mostly with the zero overage. As that's become more popular, we are seeing less bursting. If I look back a few years, that's down above 50%, 22 compared to 21, and again, 23 compared to 22. Some of it could be macro factors, hard to tell. We're not really the best gauge for folks' consumption, but more they're surfing. If I look at gaming, gaming was a better year. If I look last year, gaming was pretty weak. This year, it was pretty good. Gaming tends to be fairly lower priced delivery, so you don't get as much upside in revenue. Video was up quarter-over-quarter, but not as much as we saw the prior year. So I would say kind of an okay fourth quarter from delivery. The one area that was probably the weakest was more in sort of high tech. So think about that as new connected devices, maybe it's connected TV or a new, say an iPad or something like that, printer drivers, that sort of stuff. That was much weaker than what we saw last year. Last year was a pretty good bump up in that category. So that really sort of sums up what the dynamics are in terms of the delivery business in Q4. And I looked at that, not including the acquisition traffic. The second question you asked, if I wrote it down correctly, was the absorption of the traffic from the acquisitions. We've largely done that. The services team did a phenomenal job migrating over the customers. We did it in probably about a third of the time that we had expected to be able to do that. There's still a few stragglers, but the transition services costs are immaterial. So that's why we didn't call that out. But that's largely been done. In terms of this year, why are we seeing a down 6% if that's the math you're using for delivery? A lot of it has to do with the renewals. Unfortunately, these larger customers, as we've talked in the past, we only have about eight customers that are greater than 1% of revenue. And unfortunately, seven of them are renewing in the first half of the year. That does have a bit of an impact on the delivery business. The majority of the revenue from those customers comes from delivery. We've seen this in the past. It seems like every two years, we kind of bump into this. Even though we try to sign staggered contracts, what happens often is someone might sign a two or three year deal with a revenue commit. They'll spend that in a shorter period of time. And we just get a combination of renewals here. And then the other thing was on the shedding of traffic. So let me just get a little bit more specific with what we're doing. So last year, if you remember, we talked about being a bit more stringent with the peak to average ratios. And we're going to continue to do that. We did a pretty good job. There's still a few customers we need to adjust. And that generally happens where customers will split and they have lots of day-to-day traffic and they might split that among three or four CDNs. And then they'll have peak events, whether that's a big video event or a big download event. And we get the disproportionate size of that peak. So you want to make sure you're compensated for that. So the way to do that is you get a higher percentage of the day-to-day or you just limit the peak. So we'll continue doing that. And sometimes that may mean we lose a little bit of traffic, but that's okay because you can see the results in CapEx. The new thing that we're doing now is we've worked with product and IT to enable us to be able to build for very granular level on destinations. In the past, we generally would build based on large geos, say for example, a large geos, say for example, the U.S. or Europe or Asia. Now we're able to get one level deeper. And so we can go after some of the areas where our costs are a bit higher to deliver. It's unclear. We're assuming that customers have choice. They may decide to take that traffic somewhere else. Some of our competitors don't really focus as much on profit as we do. If that's the case, then that's okay with us. So I think as we tried to factor all that in, those are the two driving factors as to why we're not seeing a better delivery performance in 2024. I think I hit all your questions. Fatima Boolani : You did. Super comprehensive. Thank you. And an easy one, just on gross margins, you gave us the guidance for cash gross margins on the first quarter. But just qualitatively, if you can talk to us about some of the puts and takes at a full year level as we think about the mix of business changing, your focus on pricing discipline, and just even a U.S. international mix, any sort of puts and takes in terms of the dynamics we should be thinking about COGS and cash gross margins for the full year. And that's it for me. Thank you. Ed McGowan : Sure. No problem. In terms of the cost of goods sold, I'll start with the good stuff that's going on in cost of goods sold. Obviously, you touched on the mix. So as we get a higher degree of security business, that obviously helps our gross margin line. And the second thing is the movement of our third-party cloud costs onto our own platform. We did a great job so far this year. Tom talked a bit about that in his prepared remarks. And we have more to go, and we have a roadmap to get that. So that'll drive some significant savings. The downside or what's sort of contracting them or not expanding the margins as much, I should say, we could be going a bit higher, is that with the build of the Gecko sites, we'll incur some additional co-location costs. So as we start to build out those facilities, you don't have revenue to go against it. But also, as I talked about last year, when we built out some of the bigger sites, with the accounting rules, when you do long-term Colo commitments or any kind of a commitment for long-term leases, you have to straight line any commitment. So we end up with a bit of a disconnect between what we're paying in cash and what we're actually expensing. So we're able to offset that with the savings we get from the third-party cloud in the mix, but those are the underlying dynamics. Fatima Boolani : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. How different is Gecko from what you're doing now with Compute? Is this a new packaging of some of your products, or is it something a little different? And then secondly, of the CDN business that you acquired last year, how much are you expecting that to fall off? I think the goal was to try and get it out to some other services, but what are you factoring in there at that time? Tom Leighton : Yes, I'll take the first question. Yeah, Gecko is not packaging. Gecko is a new capability where we're going to be offering full-stack compute in 100 cities by the end of the year, and ultimately in hundreds of cities. We're actually taking full-stack compute, the kinds of services you get in Linode or a hyperscaler, and making that available in our edge pops. Now today, the edge pops, we have 4,000, and they run function as a service. We'll spin up JavaScript apps in 4,000 locations in over 700 cities in milliseconds based on user demand, but that's not full-stack compute. Now we're going to be taking virtual machines and containers and supporting those in our Edge platform, and that enables our customers to get much better performance and scalability, also lower cost because of the financial benefits we get from our edge platform. So it really becomes, I think, a very compelling cloud computing offering that just doesn't exist in the marketplace today. It's not a packaging thing at all. This is a new capability, and of course, ultimately, after we get the support for VMs and containers, we want to make it work just as we do function as a service, so that we'll be spinning up containers and VMs on demand where and when they're needed, and that capability doesn't exist today in the market. Ed, you want to take the CDN question, the acquisition? Ed McGowan : Yes. Sure, happy to do that. Hey, Frank. Yes, I would say, just as a reminder, when we acquired the businesses, we actually acquired selected customers. What we mean by that is we actually went through and we left some customers that we weren't going to take. For example, if someone violated our acceptable use policy, really small customers, and then, believe it or not, some that had pricing that we just didn't want to take. So we had already gone through sort of a selection process. If you recall, I had given guidance last quarter of about $18 million to $20 million for this quarter, and we hit the high end of that range, which I'm happy that we did. So we've largely been able to migrate over everything that we had hoped to. There's a few customers that churned, but by and large, we've gotten everything out of that acquisition or those acquisitions, I should say. There were two of them that we had hoped to. Frank Louthan : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from James Fish of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. James Fish : Hey, guys. First, just Tom Barth. Look, you've been a class actor and appreciate all the help over the years, and just wanted to echo Tom Leighton and Ed's sentiment there. I really appreciate the help over the years. I want to circle over to security, actually. Look, security was a little bit lower than I think we were all anticipating for Q4. I get that we have some drivers underneath that are helping the business, but did you see any push out of deals and maybe that's contributing to your confidence around mid-teens growth for 2024? Help us on the confidence for sustained mid-teens growth, and really how is that selling outside the install base and penetration of those new security packages going? Ed McGowan : Hey, Jim. This is Ed. Yes, I was actually pretty pleased with our performance and didn't see many deals push out. We didn't have any large license deals like we did in Q3, so that might be -- that always skews some of the results, so we didn't have any of that. But no deals that really pushed out from a security perspective. Very pleased with what we're seeing with Guardicore continued great growth there. That's been phenomenal, and that's a lot of customers are being driven new verticals and things like that. The channel's been doing phenomenally well there. We talked a lot about in our prepared remarks, API security. I don't get surprised often, but I've been surprised with the ARPUs there. I've been very pleased with that. That's been very, very good to see. And the strength in \u2013 we talked about the bundles that we had done a lot on the last call. That's continued to go very well, and we're seeing very strong growth in our WAF and our fraud products, too, bot management and our fraud protector. So really strength across the board. Nothing so far from macroeconomic challenges. That always can change. You never know what can happen, but nothing that we saw in Q4. As far as the projections for this year, we feel pretty confident. We've generally been relatively conservative with our approach to security growth. We don't factor in any major type of attacks where sometimes we'll see a spike in demand or anything like that. So we feel pretty good with how security's going. Tom Leighton : Maybe just to click down one level into Fatima's earlier question on the CDN side, and something that Tom said as well in his prepared remarks, is there any way to understand how much on the CDN side of the base you plan to essentially -- I don't want to say give away for free, but give away for free to get that compute revenue or help us understand kind of the dynamic between what we should expect between CDN and compute kind of dollar shifting. Thanks, guys. Tom Leighton : Yes. I think you can't factor in any percentage there at this point. We have been in some discussions with some very large media companies where we would offer discounted or free delivery in return for a significant portion of the compute business. On balance, that would be a great trade for us, much more profitable and much more revenue, because at the end of the day, big media companies will spend 10x on compute what they'll spend on delivery and even security. This is something that we see the hyperscalers do. They will sometimes give away the delivery in return for getting the compute business, because that's where the vast majority of the revenue is and very profitable. We'll keep you advised as we go if that starts to make a material difference. Operator : The next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. This is one for Ed. Throughout 2020, we talked a lot about savings initiatives. We talked a lot about migrating workloads to internal cloud and that yields savings. I got to say, just to put it bluntly, it kind of disappointing about the lack of margin expansion in the sky. Is there something holding that back or is there some incremental investments perhaps behind Gecko that we're making instead of that? Or meeting a bunch of questions like, why not more margin? Given all the efficiency sort of improvements that you guys have been putting in for the past year? Tom Leighton : Yes, I'll take this one, Tom. You broke up a little bit there, Keith, but I think I got the genesis of the question. So yes, we've done, I thought, a great job of making some acquisitions over the last few years, investing in a compute business, spending an awful lot to build out our compute facilities, adding a lot of functionality, growing our security business, doing acquisitions there as well. And got back to 30% margin last year and continuing this year. We've always said that's been a pretty healthy spot to run the business. We're investing because we see opportunity for growth and there's always a balance. You can't cut your way to greatness. Perhaps we could cut a few more points, but then what are we leaving on the table? I think we've been pretty disciplined and balanced with our approach in terms of investing for growth and returning to margin. We've got some pretty exciting areas. We're seeing great growth in API security. It's still early days there. The product will continue to get better. We've seen good ARPUs there, so I'm very excited about what we're doing there. We've made investments in go-to-market and Guardicore, and that certainly has paid off. And the investments in Computer Stein has shown some early returns. So again, it's a balanced approach. We're in this for the long-term, and I think we don't want to shoot ourselves in the foot and not go after some of these big opportunities that we have in front of us. Keith Weiss : Got it. That's clear. Tom Leighton : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. So, Tom, you've done a very solid job with the compute business. And in the prepared comments, you mentioned onboarding of submission-critical apps. I'm wondering if you could shed a little light on the pipeline of that kind of critical app that you see coming to you in 2024 and thus far. How well is your infrastructure handling the intensity of those larger workloads in terms of stability, reliability, uptime, etc? And then I have a quick follow-up. Tom Leighton : Yes. So, signing on compute customers is a big focus for us this year. We have the basic infrastructure in place. Of course, now we're building out Gecko. But just with the basic infrastructure already in 25 cities, we'll be looking to add on many more mission-critical apps from major enterprises. And some examples, you look at social media, live transcoding. We now have two giant companies using that on the platform, one for live sports broadcasting, another for live user-generated content. Another customer, we're hosting e-commerce sites for them in a way that performs better because closer to the end-user and less expensive. AI inferencing for ad targeting, personalizing content. And again, you want to do that really fast. And you just don't have time to backhaul that up into a centralized location. You want to be in a lot of locations around the world to get better performance. And again, we can do it at a lower cost. We've even got a large, one of the world's largest banks now using us, our edge compute, to register credit cards, their user credit cards with Apple Pay because Apple Pay requires you do the registration in 60 milliseconds. And the only way they can get that done fast is to do it on Akamai Connected Cloud. So really, a lot of different applications already on the platform, doing proofs of concept now. So the focus this year, and I think it's a good pipeline, is to be taking on many more mission-critical apps for major enterprises. And of course, we're the first big one. We've got enormous applications already running on the platform and very successfully. And we do it in a multi-cloud way. And as I talked about earlier, now we have the global load balancing built in, the failover capability, so that it does make for a reliable service that's high-performing. So really excited about what's coming this year. Mark Murphy : Yes. It's great to hear the tie-in with the inferencing and Apple Pay as well. So I appreciate the color of that. Ed, I wanted to ask you, you're providing the fiscal year guidance in constant currency and, of course, we all understand it's going to be very difficult to predict the actual fluctuations in the spot market, but if we looked at it at current FX levels, do you think it would skew that 6% to 8% revenue growth level higher or lower? If we were to try to translate it into reported U.S. dollars in our models right now today? Ed McGowan : Yes, good question. I think the CPI report today gave you a good view of how things can change so quickly. The market originally had thought there'd be a lot of rate cuts and now all of a sudden that doesn't look like it's going to happen and obviously currencies and interest rates are very closely aligned. So if you look, I gave you the 1231 number, so obviously the dollar has gotten a bit stronger. I gave you the numbers in terms of the total non-U.S. dollars, so you can kind of do some math. It would still be in that range. Obviously, it'd be a little bit of a headwind just given that the dollar's gotten stronger since 1231, but I think you can take our Q1 guidance and sort of fold that in and think about the normal seasonality that you have and come up with an answer. But it would still be in that range, though. Mark Murphy : And just to clarify, so it's still in that 68% range if we put it into USD or are you saying it's still kind of mid-single-digit, but maybe some like a point lower? Ed McGowan : Well, no, I mean, if you're using spot rates as of today, the simple math would suggest that it is, yes. If you looked at, just take the midpoint of the guide, right? Just say if I just use that and what the impact of the dollar has been, it's still in that range. Now, you would ask, could it be higher? Obviously, the dollar was at 101 back at 1231. It was at 106 in November, and so it's bouncing all over the place. Obviously, if it were to move, you can do the math, five or six points lower, you could potentially get on the other side of that. So, again, it's just I'd be end up giving you guys a massive range that wouldn't be helpful. So what I'd rather do is just give you guys the tools that you can do it yourself and look at, really get an understanding of the core business underneath that. How is that? I think it's much more important to understand. Mark Murphy : Understood. Thank you very much. And I want to also thank Tom Barth for a lot of great interactions over the years. Operator : The next question comes from Madeline Brooks of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Madeline Brooks : Hi, team. Thanks so much for taking my question tonight. Just one on security. Outside of Guardicore, I just want to touch on this year, the rest of the Zero Trust portfolio trends that you've seen and maybe if you're feeling any additional competitive pressure now that the market has really expanded there? And then I have one follow-up. Tom Leighton : Yes. In Web App Firewall, we've been the market leader there, for 10 years since we started that marketplace with Web App Firewall as a service. And after 10 years, you do get, competition. But we're still the market leader by a good margin. And that's a good growth business for us. We've added a lot of capabilities on top, bot management and more recently, account protector, client side protection so that customers of commerce sites can stay safe by going to the site. You need going to need that now for compliance. There's a brand protector. So that's identifying the phishing sites and keeping them from stealing, user information. Of course, we've been doing, denial of service protection for a long, long time now. Market leadership position there. And then you have on the enterprise side, of course, Guardicore we talked about doing very well. And I'm really excited about API security. I think over the longer term, that becomes as big a marketplace and just as important as Web App Firewall has become. And our goal there is to become the market leader. And already in the go-to-market motion, there's a strong synergy between Web App Firewall and API security. We built a very easy way to do a proof-of-concept for our Web App Firewall customers. And that's where we're getting a lot of early traction. Also, we've integrated with a lot of the load balancers and other firewalls out there so that we can sign on new customers who are, not using my CDN or Web App Firewall. So I think, there's a variety of areas in security that are working very well for us. Madeline Brooks : Thanks so much, Tom. And then just one quick one on compute, too. I think if we think about earnings that have happened so far, especially with hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft, Meta, we've kind of heard of this theme of the optimization inflection in terms of cloud computing, meaning maybe this year we're going to see a little bit more investment in new workloads. I'm just wondering if you've heard of any of those trends among your customers who are thinking about compute for the first time, or maybe if you're seeing increased appetite for compute for this coming year versus 2023. Thanks so much. Tom Leighton : Yes, compute is an enormous marketplace and growing rapidly, and there's always new applications that are being created, and not just migrating from a data center into the cloud, but just brand new applications. So that's where we're seeing a lot of traction. Also, in some cases, lift and shift out of a data center or out of a hyperscaler. But it's just an enormous marketplace and a great place for us to operate. And even those that are optimizing, that's sort of, I guess, not such a great thing for the hyperscalers, but we're part of that trend. It's great for us, because we can help customers reduce cloud spend. And we've gotten very good feedback from our early adopters of Akamai Connected Cloud that they're saving a lot of money. So the trend to optimization is a positive thing for Akamai. Operator : The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria of RBC. Please go ahead. Rishi Jaluria : Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my questions. And let me echo my colleagues in thanking Tom Barth. It's been a great decade working with you, and I'm really excited for your next chapter. I wanted to drill on to maybe going back to Gecko. I guess, number one, can you talk a little bit about edge inferencing and what those use cases look like? It's one of those things that we hear a lot of talk about in theory, but maybe in practicality as you're talking with your customers and having those conversations, what can that look like? And what positions Gecko uniquely for that? And then maybe financially, to the extent I know it's still early, are you assuming real Gecko contribution on the compute line in your guidance for the year? Or is that something that as it gets traction could lead to more upside beyond what you model? Thank you. Tom Leighton : Great. So let me start with edge inferencing. And so some of the examples I gave, that's exactly what's happening for commerce sites in figuring out in real time what content you're actually going to give to the user that's coming to the site. Ad targeting, what ad do they get? Anything that involves personalization. On the security side, a ton of inferencing is used to analyze real-time data. For example, even our own bot management solution. Is that entity that's coming to the site, is it a bot or is it a human? And even if it's a human and they have the right credentials, is it the right human? And you use AI and inferencing for that, and you've got to do it really fast. You can't afford to send it back to the centralized data center because you've got a massive number of people that you've got to process in real time, especially if you're doing some kind of live event. And so being at the edge matters, because you can be scalable, you can handle it locally, you get great performance, you can make it be real time. And Akamai's unique value proposition with Gecko is that we're going to be able to now support this, not in a few cities, but in a hundred cities by the end of this year. So anything you can put in a VM, virtual machine, which is most things, you're going to be able to do that in a hundred cities. And then ultimately in hundreds of cities, because we can put this in general Akamai Edge pods. And then next will be containers, which is pretty much the rest of what you do in cloud computing. And then to be able to spin it all up automatically. It's a whole new concept for compute that I think is very powerful, and there's a high overlap of wanting to do that with inferencing engines, where you're trying to do something intelligent based on that end user or that end entity that's interacting with the application. Now, in terms of Gecko, we're just now in the early stages of getting it deployed. We're in nine cities, we'll get the 10th new city up in another month or so. By the end of the year, we'll be in a total of a hundred cities supporting compute. So not a lot of revenue is factored into the guidance based on Gecko for this year. That would come more next year. So this year's revenue guidance is based on the original 25 core compute regions that we've set up by the end of last year. Now we will deploy this, of course, just as fast as we can and as customers want to adopt it. And hopefully we have the situation where we want to build out more, get more compute capacity because there's so much demand for compute on Akamai. Ed, do you have any color you want to add around the guidance there? Ed McGowan : No, I think you captured it right, Tom. We don't, we're not really anticipating anything. I mean, one thing we are doing this year is we are making changes to our comp plan with our reps so that they're all, all have to sell compute this year. So you could see things, reps get very creative. I learned in sales that comp drives behavior. So by leaning in here and making it something that all reps have to do, we should see a lot more use cases, a lot more opportunities, etcetera. So there's always a chance that we could be surprised here with the creativity of our field bringing us opportunities, but we did not factor in anything material as it relates to Gecko. Rishi Jaluria : All right, wonderful. Thank you so much, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Michael Elias : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I may. Just first on Gecko, presumably the pops that you have, they're already supporting security and delivery workloads. So from an architecture perspective, can you help us think about what expanding the compute platform into these pops means? Is it just additional co-location deployments and on the CapEx side, networking gear and servers? Any color that you could give there in terms of the mechanics of what the expansion would look like? And then second, Ed, last year you were talking about elongation of enterprise sales cycles. Just curious what you're seeing in terms of the buying behavior of your customer base. Any notable call-outs there? Thank you. Tom Leighton : All right. So I'll take the first one. With Gecko, that is generally speaking an existing Akamai Edge pops. And in particular, they tend to be the larger ones where we already have a lot of equipment. It's already connected into our backbone. And what we'd be doing is adding additional servers. And for compute, it would be a beefier server and additional COLO for those servers. But all the other infrastructure is generally already there. And it's already connected in and we already have delivery and security operating there. So it does become a very efficient way for us to deploy Gecko. And Ed, you want to take the second one there? Ed McGowan : Sure. Yes. So I think the trend, obviously, acquiring new customers is always challenging in an environment like this. The one probably exception to that is in the security space. That tends to be something that obviously, now with the requirements with the SEC reporting and I added a disclosure with CISOs being now potentially criminally charged for breaches and things like that. Audit Committee is spending more and more time on cybersecurity as a topic. That tends to be a budget that, one, you don't typically cut and, two, you're generally adding to. But yes, new customers are challenging. I do think this kind of environment helps us what we were just talking about in the last few questions, around optimizing cloud spend. Certainly, if you've seen what we've done, we've spent [ph] a tremendous amount of money. So I think that can also help us in this particular environment. But definitely, new customer acquisition is a bit more challenging, but we're still doing pretty well. Obviously, the environment can change. But it hasn't been a major factor for us yet. Michael Elias : Great. Thank you Operator : The next question comes from Ray McDonough of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Raymond McDonough : Great, thanks for sneaking me in. Maybe, Tom, just a follow-up to a prior question. As we think about Gecko and you mentioned that your edge sites right now don't have full stack compute. But how much work is done to be to converge what you already have at your edge sites and what you've done in terms of building out the nodes capabilities? Should we expect there to be a common software stack across both edge and centralized sites? And if so, is the plan to have that in place by year-end? Tom Leighton : Yes. Great question. So what we're doing now is, as I mentioned in the last question, deploying more hardware in existing edge region and generally the larger edge regions. We already have network there. We already have delivery security located there. So there's some additional color and servers. And yes, the goal is to put it all on one common software stack. Now initially, we have the Linode stack is moving into these edge pops for Gecko. But as we once we get the support for virtual machines and containers, then next, we want to add the software stack that we have for delivery and for security and for function as a service that automatically, for example, spins up JavaScript apps and milliseconds based on end-user demand, we want all of that to be operating on containers and VMs. So that you don't have to think ahead of time about how many VMs do you want in each of these hundreds of cities? It just happens based on end user demand. You automatically get new ones spun up, load balancing, fail over, really a very compelling concept. And that doesn't exist in the cloud marketplace today. That is the vision -- I think you really nailed it when you talked about the common software stack because only Akamai has that full edge platform today, that software stack around delivery and security that will be now including compute. Raymond McDonough : Appreciate that color. And maybe as a quick follow-up, as we think about the expansion of the Linode footprint last year, can you help us understand as much as you can, how much of the space currently built out was for internal use purposes to help with that third-party cloud savings versus space that's online now that's revenue generating? And I know we've talked about this in the past, but any color around what we should expect from a customer utilization perspective that might be embedded in your guidance as we move through year-end? That would be helpful. Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So the majority of the growth in the compute guidance is going to come from enterprise compute. So the stuff that we built out for the last year. So if you kind of go back and look at the math in terms of -- we've kind of said roughly speaking, $1 of CapEx is $1 of revenue. You can kind of look at what we're doing for compute build-out now what we did last year. We said we got about $100 million roughly for our -- all in for our internal use. So that leaves a pretty significant amount left for customer demand. Now obviously, the way people buy today, they pick a location, etcetera. So it's not going to be exactly a dollar for dollar right now, but it's a general rule of thumb. So I would say the majority of what we built out is for customer usage. Raymond McDonough : Great. Thanks for sneaking me in. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Timothy Horan : Thanks guys. Following up on Ray's question. So I'm assuming the goal here is to get to one single platform where customers can access the full range of services relatively easily on, I guess, one on ramp up. When do you think you'll get there? And secondly, the Gecko product, it sounds like is this completely serverless? And is it a development platform also? Thanks. Tom Leighton : Yes. So I think one platform really in terms of being able to do everything together and all the same software so that we have our Edge software running with the Linode software to spin up VMs and containers that's not until 2025. We are, first, combining the infrastructure and of course, customers can buy the services as a package. We have common reporting now in many cases. But in terms of doing all the automatic spinning up and truly serverless used for VMs and containers, think 2025 for that. And let's see. So -- and what was the other question you had? Timothy Horan : So the new product, Gecko, it is primarily a serverless product, it sounds like. And do you have all the support there for developers to completely run their applications on this new platform? Tom Leighton : Yes. And it's -- it depends how you define serverless, initially with Gecko, you would operate it the same way you would Linode. You decide how many VMs and containers you want in the various cities. And it is very developer-friendly, works just like Linode. So if you're familiar there, that would now work in -- well, at the end of the year, 100 cities for your virtual machines. Now if you define serverless to be -- which doesn't exist today out in the marketplace for VMs and containers, they just spin up automatically like we do today for Function as a Service and for JavaScript, that's what comes 2025. Timothy Horan : If you don't mind me asking me, it sounds a lot like what Cloudflare is doing, but you're saying it doesn't exist today. Tom, can you maybe talk about a little bit what's different, what you're doing? Tom Leighton : Yes, that's a great question. They don't support VMs or containers at all, never mind serverless or anything else, just -- they don't have support for that. They don't do this full stack cloud computing. Timothy Horan : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Henderson of Needham. Please go ahead. Alex Henderson : Great. So it seems pretty clear that Guardicore is a critical piece of your security growth. And obviously is perturbing the overall growth rate. I was hoping you could give us some sense of what the security product lines, excluding Guardicore look like in terms of their growth rates. Any sizing of that growth would be even a ballpark would be quite helpful. And then second, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your -- you mentioned inferencing, but I think it came in kind of as an afterthought as opposed to the primary focus. Can you talk about your involvement in AI inferencing at the edge and to what extent that requires either the 2025 kind of structure or what needs you have there and whether you're putting GPUs out of the edge in order to facilitate that? Tom Leighton : Ed, do you want to go with the first one, and I'll take the second one? Ed McGowan : Sure. Why don't I go to the first one? On the spirit of it being a year-end call, I'll break out these numbers at a high level for you, but won't be doing it every quarter. So if I look at the -- what we used to -- what we call the Appen API security bucket, that's our largest bucket, that includes bot management, our fraud products, our web app firewall, our new API security product. That's actually in Q4 growing over 20%. So that's been incredible. Guardicore itself, if I normalize for the onetime software that we did last Q4 is growing at about 6%. And infrastructure and services are growing sub-10%. Alex Henderson : Just to be clear, is this the full year growth rate? Or is this the fourth quarter growth rate? Ed McGowan : This is the fourth quarter growth rate. The full year I don't have [indiscernible]. Alex Henderson : That's sufficient. I just needed to know what it was. Tom Leighton : Okay. Yes, in terms of the question around inferencing and AI and so forth, yes, we're building full stack compute to have great performance at a lower price point and have that available in hundreds of cities. And one of the many things that you would do with that is AI inferencing and that's not an afterthought. In fact, we've been using AI in our products for, well, 10 years, bot management, for example, runs on Akamai connected cloud. It's one of many things that run on it. So not an afterthought. There is an enormous amount of buzz now about AI. And I think a lot of that is justified. And I think there's a lot more compute going to be consumed because of AI. And it is a strong use case among our customers that are using Akamai connected cloud. That said, it's not all AI. In fact, our biggest customers are doing media workflow, doing live transcoding. And that's not using AI. So I think AI is an important use case, one of several use cases. Now in particular, you asked 2024 versus 2025 it's being done already on our platforms. There's no need to wait until the end of the year unless you want to do it in 100 cities, then that comes at the end of the year. No need to wait to 2025 when the instances are spun up automatically instead of by design ahead of time the way compute works today. So you talked about GPUs. Akamai has GPUs deployed, we're deploying more. We've used them in the past for graphics. And going forward, probably use them for Gen AI uses. We're not really deploying them right now in the edge pops. And that's not -- it just because you don't need to. It's not cost-effective. And the edge pops, you're going to be doing the inferencing. And for the inferencing, you can use GPUs, but we're also using CPUs. And right now, we get a better ROI on the CPUs. So I guess there's a lot of confusion there as well. Now GPUs are critical for doing training for especially large language models and that's going to be done in the core and we're not supporting that as a key use case today. We could, in theory, right, we have all the technology to do it, but that's not where we're focused in terms of getting the best ROI for our platform. And for that matter, most of the work with these models, most of the compute is done when you're using them for the inferencing. You do the training, and then you spend -- just so it learns you get it ready to go, and then you operate it. And it's the operation where most the vast majority of the cycles are and that can be done on CPUs. And in many cases, the cases I mentioned, for a personalization for security, for data analytics, that's done on the edge more as good reason to be done there using CPU-based hardware. Alex Henderson : Great. Thanks for the complete answer. Operator : The next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Please go ahead. Jonathan Ho : Hi, good afternoon. Just one question from me. How important is the global load balancing capability? And what does that maybe mean for your ability to either attract more customers or to drive revenue from that product? Thank you. Tom Leighton : Yes, that's very helpful because it makes it much more scalable. You have failover, so much more reliable. And I think it's the basic capability, of course, we've had forever, it seems in delivery of security, and now that's available for compute. So I think that's important and that greatly increases the market we can go after for compute. Jonathan Ho : Thank you. Tom Leighton : And operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : Our last question will come from Rudy Kessinger of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger : Hey thanks for squeezing me in guys. Ed if my math is correct, even if I exclude the $100 million in CapEx and compute last year, intended for moving over internal workloads between last year and this year, it looks to be about $400 million in compute CapEx. And going back to that kind of $1 in CapEx equals $1 of revenue capacity, $400 million in CapEx, roughly $200 million of compute growth 2024 versus 2022. Do you feel like you guys are maybe over building at all? Or what gives you the confidence, I guess, in the pipeline and the ramping usage to spend so much on another round of build-out this year when we're not yet seeing growth accelerate, right? You're guiding to 20% growth next year that's flat with Q4. Tom Leighton : Yes. So I'll just -- let me address that part first. So I would say if you look at the underlying components of what's growing, it's actually that enterprise compute opportunity that's growing very, very, very fast, like those numbers, the percentages would be kind of foolish to break out because they're going off of small numbers and adding to them very big numbers. Now also part of our strategy is to be competitive and have big core centers in many cities, and that does require a larger build out. So there's a lot of capacity that we have to sell. And then also, we're seeing demand in certain cities, you have to build out more capacity where you're getting demand. And then the Gecko sites that we're building out, it's not a significant -- I mean it's a decent amount of capital. But I think that is another big key differentiator for us. And as Tom mentioned, we think there's a big opportunity there. So I know a lot of people have been questioning us being able to take on large workloads, etcetera. We clearly have a lot of capacity out there. As I talked about earlier, we've made the change with our compensation plans where our reps now have to sell compute. So we're going to see a lot more of that. We've done a tremendous amount with the platform in terms of adding functionality. We built out the platform, connected it to our backbone, and we have a lot of new compute partners. The platform is ready to be sold so we're pretty optimistic about it. And I think we're building in a pretty responsible manner. As I talked about, our CapEx is relatively modest for this business right now. So I think we're in pretty good shape. Tom Leighton : And with that, that will end today's call. I want to thank everyone for joining, and have a great evening. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Stoutenberg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mark Stoutenberg : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions, and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 9th, 2024. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events, or circumstances, except as required by law. As a reminder, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. I will now hand the call off to our CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Mark. Akamai got off to a strong start for the year with our Security and Compute portfolios. And we continued to experience industry headwinds with our delivery product-line. First quarter revenue grew to $987 million, up 8% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.64, up 17% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. The fast growing parts of our business, security and cloud computing, grew to represent almost two-thirds of total revenue in Q1, and combined they grew 22% over Q1 of 2023. The continued shift in Akamai's revenue mix towards security and compute, is a clear indicator that our growth strategy is achieving the intended results. We continue to successfully leverage the market leadership and cashflow of our delivery product line to invest in our faster growing and more profitable security and cloud computing portfolios. And we are excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us, especially with our planned acquisition of Noname Security, which we announced this week. I'll say more about Noname in a minute. But first, looking at our security portfolio more broadly, security revenue grew 21% year-over-year in Q1 to $491 million, driven in part by continued strong demand for our market-leading Guardicore Segmentation Solution. Customers who purchased Segmentation from Akamai in Q1 included one of the top telcos in the US, a supermarket chain with more than 1,500 stores across Canada, and a major business management software company in Latin America. Our Zero Trust Network Access Solution, is also seeing good traction. For example, the United States Army announced last month that it selected Akamai for Zero Trust Security in Battlefield Networks. After a competitive evaluation of more than 40 vendors, the Army will use Akamai for its tactical identity, credential, and access management to enhance defenses in high-risk operational environments and limit network access to authorized users, devices, applications, and services. In response to customer requests to bring our Enterprise Zero Trust solutions together into a single platform, we've integrated Guardicore with our other enterprise security solutions to form our recently announced Akamai Guardicore platform. This new platform is the first of its kind to enable Zero Trust Security through a fully integrated combination of micro segmentation, Zero Trust Network Access, multi-factor authentication, DNS firewall, and threat hunting. All designed to strengthen and simplify enterprise security with broad visibility and granular controls through a single console. We think it will appeal to customers looking to consolidate security vendors and integrate their security tools. We also continue to see strong customer interests in our app and API security solutions. Customers who purchased Akamai API Security in Q1, included a major consumer financial services company, a US supermarket chain with more than 1,200 stores, and a leading US manufacturer of electric vehicles. Last month, one of our largest customers, a well-known hyperscaler, was hit with a massive denial-of-service attack, 24 million requests per minute. Using our rate controls and custom web app firewall rules, the customer successfully forwarded 99.999% of the attack traffic. That's five nines of protection. The customer was delighted, telling us, \u201cthat's an A-plus by just about every calculation\u201d. Unlike some of our competitors who struggled to defend against far smaller DDoS attacks in recent months, Akamai is capable of protecting even the hyperscalers. The scale of Akamai defenses and the depth of our expertise really matter for customers, who named Akamai a Customer's Choice for the fifth-year in a row in the new Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customers report for cloud web app and API protection. And soon, our suite of app and API security solutions will become even stronger with the planned acquisition of Noname Security. The use of APIs has exploded in nearly every industry, driven by digital transformation, the widespread adoption of mobile phones and IoT devices, and the increased sharing of data between third-party providers. The increasing use of APIs also opens up new threat vectors for attackers and the need for API security. For example, we saw API attacks on our platform more than double from January 2023 to January 2024. And IDC Research now predicts that the API security market will grow at a CAGR of 34% to nearly a $1 billion by 2027. That's one reason why we are so excited about our plan to acquire Noname, as we accelerate our momentum in this fast growing segment. As one of the market leading API security offerings, Noname delivers visibility into API business logic abuse and contextual awareness between API requests and responses to ensure that anomalous traffic is detected, inspected, and blocked when warranted. We believe that the addition of Noname to our API security solution will offer Akamai customers enhanced attack analysis, more flexible deployment options, and extensive vendor integrations. Ed will share some financial details about the acquisition shortly. Turning now to cloud computing, I'm pleased to say that 2024 is off to a great start, with strong early momentum across multiple verticals. Customers are excited about our differentiated cloud platform, which offers superior performance through a more distributed footprint, cloud diversification, and lower costs. Examples of major enterprises using our cloud computing platform now include one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, several global auto manufacturers, several large direct-to-consumer and OTT providers, several global SaaS providers, numerous travel and hospitality companies, including one of the world's largest cruise lines and a large airline in Asia, one of the largest credit unions in the US. A multinational financial services company. An iconic global corporation that manufactures and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. A European cyber security company, and a leading ad tech company. Just this week, we signed up one of the world's best known media companies to a two-year deal worth several million dollars per year for compute. Yet another great example of major enterprises using our new cloud computing platform is Sony Group. Sony is excited about Akamai's investment into Edge Compute and has multiple latency-sensitive compute workloads that are running on Akamai. Current use cases include PlayStation.com, leveraging Edge Compute to improve search engine optimization, and PlayStation Direct, leveraging Edge Compute to ensure a fair experience for customers purchasing PlayStation Hardware. We're also seeing strong early traction with our Independent Software Vendor, or ISV, partners. They offer solutions that run on our compute platform in which our go-to-market teams co-sell to help customers solve big challenges with a better together solution. For example, a media workflow provider, which powers OTT video, now offers its live encoder solution on Akamai Connected Cloud. The solution is designed to increase efficiency for large scale streaming while also lowering egress fees, by as much as 90% according to their calculations. Joint customers of the offering include OneFootball, one of the world's biggest digital soccer platforms, backed by clubs such as Real Madrid, Manchester City, and Bayern Munich. In partnership with an observability solution provider, we won cloud computing deals in Q1 with one of the world's leading gaming companies, a leading luxury goods brand in Europe and one of India's largest conglomerates. Their solution powers observability using Akamai Cloud computing and enables real-time data ingestion at scale, lightning fast query performance, and extensive data retention at a fraction of the cost of other platforms. Another ISV partner that is providing distributed database services, enabled a well-known online travel marketplace to go live in Q1, with a geolocation implementation that uses Akamai\u2019s Edge Computing to execute code at the edge for optimal performance. The travel site invoked more than 68 billion Edge Compute instances in March alone. By the end of Q1, we had over 200 customers spending $36,000 or more in Annual Recurring Revenue for our new compute services, with about half spending $100,000 or more, and six spending over $1 million per year, all just for compute. All of these customer counts are triple what we had in Q1 of last year. Collectively, these customers are spending over $50 million annually coming out of Q1 for our new cloud computing solutions, which is up more than 4 times year-over-year. Beginning this quarter, our global enterprise cloud sales team is now led by Dan Lawrence, who joined us from AWS, where he ran data and analytics for its private equity segment. Before that, Dan ran the Americas analytics business for five customer segments, including gaming and high-tech SaaS. Dan joined Akamai for the potential he sees to combine Akamai's trusted brand and Edge Computing platform with the large market opportunity and distributed cloud. I'll now say a few words about content delivery, which represents a little over one-third of our overall revenue. Akamai remains the market leader in delivery by a wide margin, providing the scale and performance required by the world's top brands as we help them deliver reliable, secure, and near-flawless digital experiences. That said, our delivery revenue was less than expected in Q1, due to slowing traffic growth across the industry, and a large social media customer that is now optimizing their business to reduce costs. As a result, and as Ed will discuss shortly, we now expect our delivery revenue to decline at a higher rate this year. As we've noted before, delivery continues to generate profits that we use to fuel our future growth. It also helps our security and cloud computing portfolios, as we harvest the competitive and cost advantages of offering delivery, security, and compute on the same platform. Of course, we are not happy to see the declining revenue in our delivery portfolio. And while it remains difficult to predict exactly when that business will begin to stabilize, we believe that Akamai\u2019s CDN remains a critical enabler of doing business on the internet. This has been the case for the past 25 years, and we remain convinced that businesses will continue to need Akamai's superior scale, reliability, and security in the future as they migrate more workloads to the cloud, seek to secure their internal and external applications, and look to unlock the promise of AI, often while also leveraging Akamai security and compute capabilities. Moreover, given the exciting growth we're seeing in our security and compute portfolios, we believe it is only a matter of time before these businesses drive accelerating revenue growth for Akamai as a whole. In summary, we are pleased by the strong performance of our security and compute portfolios to start the year. And we are very excited about our potential for future growth and profitability, as we add Noname to our security portfolio and as our fast-growing compute portfolio contributes a larger share of revenue. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our Q1 results and our outlook for Q2 in the full year. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. Today I plan to review our Q1 results and then provide some color on our Q2 expectations in our updated full year 2024 guidance, along with the financial impact of our recently announced acquisition of Noname Security. Before we get into that, I wanted to address a few items, including what Tom mentioned in his remarks, that have caused us to reduce our guidance for the remainder of the year. First, the US Dollar has strengthened significantly since the start of the year. As we have noted on many prior calls, foreign exchange fluctuations can significantly impact our top and bottom lines. Based on the strength of the US dollar, we now expect FX to have a negative impact of approximately $40 million on our top-line outlook for the full year 2024. That translates to a negative impact of approximately $0.12 to our expected non-GAAP EPS for 2024. In addition, we expect this will negatively impact our full year 2024 non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 30 basis points. Second, as Tom mentioned, a large social media customer has recently taken steps to lower its costs through a series of optimizations across its platform. As a result, they have reduced their overall traffic. Therefore, we now expect approximately $40 million to $60 million less revenue from this customer for the full year than we previously thought. This change will primarily impact our delivery product line. Finally, as Tom mentioned in his remarks, in addition to the large social media customer, we have seen lower than expected traffic in our delivery business over the past two months, most notably in gaming and video. This is in-line with similar patterns that were cited earlier this week in a research note from a leading Wall Street bank that stated, video streaming services were seeing a drop in downloads, in active users during April. The note also mentioned that weakness was coming from streaming service providers pushing for ad-supported versions and password sharing crackdowns to stay ahead in the streaming wars. As a result of these recent market conditions, it's prudent to assume that this traffic weakness will continue for the remainder of 2024. This lower traffic outlook would translate into approximately $20 million to $30 million less delivery revenue for the remainder of the year than we previously expected. The good news is that in contrast to some other competitors in the industry, both our delivery business and the overall company continue to be highly profitable. As a result, the significant cash flows we generate give us the financial flexibility to execute strategic acquisitions, return capital to shareholders, invest in our future growth, and further diversify our business away from delivery and into the faster growing and even more profitable areas of security and compute. Turning now to our first quarter results. Total revenue for the first quarter was $987 million, up 8% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Our two fastest growing offerings, Compute and Security, grew 22% year-over-year on a combined basis and now represent 64% of total revenue. Compute revenue was $145 million, up 25% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. As Tom mentioned, we have more than 200 enterprise customers using our cloud computing solutions. Our offerings clearly resonate well with customers and we remain optimistic about the early traction we see from large enterprise businesses. It's worth noting that the annual run rate of our enterprise compute revenue is now over $50 million and is growing at over 300% year-over-year. Security revenue was $491 million. Security revenue grew 21% year-over-year as reported, and in constant currency. We are very pleased by our continued performance with our Guardicore Zero Trust Solution and highly encouraged by the traction we are seeing in our recently launched API security solution. Moving to delivery. Revenue was $352 million, which declined 11% year-over-year as reported and 10% in constant currency. International revenue was $475 million, up 7% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency, representing 48% of total revenue in Q1. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $2 million on a sequential basis and a negative $4 million impact on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $225 million or $1.64 of earnings per diluted share, up 17% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. And finally, our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 30%. Moving now to cash and our use of capital. As of March 31, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.3 billion. During the first quarter, we spent approximately $125 million to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares. We now have roughly $400 million remaining on our previously announced share buyback authorization. As noted in today's press release, our board authorized a new buyback program of up to $2 billion effective today in running through the end of June, 2027. Combining the two authorizations, we currently have roughly $2.4 billion available for share repurchases. Our intention is to continue buying back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases. Earlier this week, we announced our intent to acquire Noname security for approximately $450 million. We believe this acquisition demonstrates our continued balance approach to capital allocation by opportunistically buying back shares over time, while maintaining sufficient capital to deploy when strategic M&A presents itself. Before I provide our Q2 and full year 2024 guidance, I wanted to touch on some housekeeping items. First, regarding our planned acquisition of Noname Security. We expect this transaction to add approximately $20 million in revenue for the full year, to be diluted to non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.10, and to be diluted to non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 50 basis points in 2024. We expect that the acquisition will close sometime in June. We do not expect the acquisition to have a material impact on Q2 results. And as a reminder, our updated full-year guidance includes the impact of the acquisition. Finally, specific to traffic, we expect a modest uptick in media traffic in Q3, primarily due to the Olympics. This event is expected to drive approximately $3 million to $4 million of additional revenue in the third quarter. And while Q4 is typically our strongest quarter seasonally, we saw a more muted impact of that seasonality last year. We expect that we will see a similar result this year. So with those factors in mind, turning to our Q2 guidance. We are now projecting revenue in a range of $967 million to $986 million or up 3% to 5% as reported, and 4% to 6% in constant currency over Q2 2023. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $5 million impact on Q2 revenue compared to Q1 levels and a negative $9 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 72% to 73%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $302 million to $307 million. We expect Q2 EBITDA margins of approximately 41% to 42%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $126 million to $128 million. And we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% to 29% for Q2. Moving on to CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $175 million to $183 million. This represents approximately 18% to 19% of our projected total revenue. Based on our expectations for revenue and cost, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.51 to $1.56. The CPS guidance assumes taxes of $56 million to $59 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19% to 19.5%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we now expect revenue of $3,950 million to $4,020 million, which is up 4% to 5% year-over-year as [reported now] (ph) 4% to 6% in constant currency. We now expect security revenue growth of approximately 15% to 17% in constant currency in 2024, including the contribution from the acquisition of Noname. With a strong start for our compute offerings in Q1, we now expect compute revenue growth to be approximately 21% to 23% in constant currency for the full year 2024. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% to 29%. We now estimate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $6.20 to $6.40. Our non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on the non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19% to 19.5%, and fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Finally, our full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 16% of total revenue. This updated CapEx is higher than our original expectations outlined last quarter due to our lower revenue outlook, slightly higher software capitalization rates across the business as more work is being done on capitalized projects and higher than expected server component costs, driven primarily by NAND storage pricing in certain servers that support our cloud computing buildup. In closing, we are pleased with our progress in security and compute to start the year. Tom and I would be very happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Madeline Brooks from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Madeline Brooks : Hi, team. Thanks so much for taking my question, and great to see compute kick up in terms of the guidance. One question for me on the delivery side of the house. Last quarter you had mentioned that first quarter and second quarter of this year we were going to see a few renewals. I just wanted to see how those renewals were going if there was any updated outlook in your guidance from the renewal side of the house. Thank you. Ed McGowan : Hey, Madeline, this is Ed. Yeah, so the renewals are going as planned in terms of the pricing expectations. We've got a few of them done now. We'll have about five of the seven completed by the end of this quarter, and the other two will be done in early Q3. As far as expectations go, like I said, pricing is coming in-line. Volume a little bit lower than we expected normally when we do these large renewals. We tend to see an uptick in traffic. We just haven't seen that. So that's all been reflected in our guidance. Madeline Brooks : Great. Thanks. Let me ask you one more question if I could. For those renewals [or financing] (ph) your larger deals, are you seeing any type of offsetting with compute growth for maybe some larger customers where you are seeing lower volume? Ed McGowan : I'm sorry, could you just repeat that again? Madeline Brooks : Are you seeing a lower customers, larger customers who are coming in maybe with lower volume than expected? Are you seeing that offset at all by any type of compute growth or growth in other areas of the business? Tom Leighton : Yeah, they're not directly tied, but as we talked about, several of the world's largest media companies are starting to use our compute capabilities for a variety of tasks. So that's a good new story. It's not tied to the traffic levels in any way. Of course, these big media companies still use Akamai for a large fraction of their delivery needs, but traffic in the industry as a whole, especially media and gaming, is lower than we had initially expected. Madeline Brooks : Great, thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joshua Baer : Thank you, this is Josh Baer on for Keith. The Question was on margin guidance. It was lowered I think by 150 basis points at the midpoint, 50 from the Noname acquisition. You mentioned 30 base points from FX. I was hoping you could just walk through the rest of the move lower on the margin guidance? Ed McGowan : Yeah, I think just the rest of that would just be due to the lower delivery revenue as a whole. Joshua Baer : Okay, got it. I guess as a follow-up related to margins, is there any structural change in reaching, I guess, the low 30s type of long-term target and just asking given the lower guidance for this year but also because from a mixed perspective you've actually moved faster to the higher margin security and compute versus delivery. Thank you. Ed McGowan : Yeah, sure. So there's really no structural change. Obviously, we're making some pretty big investments in R&D, and you can see that in the R&D line. And also just the acquisitions, we made an acquisition last year, made an acquisition now. So we're investing in growth. But there's also a fair bit of investment that goes into the cost of goods sold-line as we build out our compute platform. So you can see that in the higher co-location costs. And there is some accounting that you have to do when you enter into some of the long-term agreements for co-location. So we should start to see that, get some benefit of that as compute grows even faster. Joshua Baer : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from James Fish from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. James Fish : Hey guys, just on the social media customer here, I think I may know what's going on, but you know, it does seem as though traffic has been slowing for the last, you know, two years or so from what we can tell. But on some of these renewals and specifically on the social media customer, I guess what's the confidence that this isn't just tied to kind of DIY efforts picking back up in the space? Tom Leighton : Yeah, for the large social media customer we talked about, there's a few components generally tied to their efforts to reduce costs. You know, they are using less bits per transaction and end-user experience. They're optimizing their doing less prefetching. They do have a very large DIY component as well and we haven't seen the impact of that yet but we do think that they may use that more throughout the rest of the year and that's factored into our lower guidance for this particular customer. So we haven't seen that yet, but we anticipated at this point as part of their overall cost reduction efforts. James Fish : Got it. And then on the security side of the house, I mean, what did Noname have that [sure] (ph) Neosec was smaller in scale, but that Neosec didn't. And so why isn't this just kind of a role of strategy of kind of the API space? And Ed, if you could just walk me through the security guidance? You guys had a pretty good beat here. And I get FX is kind of moving against you on this, but why wouldn't we see further upside given the strength you saw in Q1? Is it just because some of the security revenues tied to some of these delivery renewals or why the conservative security guide? Tom Leighton : I'll take the first part and then let Ed to answer the second part. Yeah, Noname is a market leader. And they have a lot of capabilities that we don't have yet. And it's actually very synergistic with what we have. They have an on-prem and hybrid-solution. Our solution has been SaaS-only. They have a great channel partner ecosystem, market-leading presence, very easy to use and to integrate. And by the time we get the acquisition closed later this quarter, we anticipate we'll have full integration with Akamai Security Services, which is the piece they were really missing. And great user experience and console. So really strong capabilities and of course much bigger business. And with our solution, we can add to that I think stronger forensics and threat hunting with our data lake capabilities and by putting the pieces together, really a very compelling solution. I was just out at RSA earlier this week and I got to say the news was incredibly well received. A lot of customers, both ours and Noname customers, very happy about the acquisition and what we're going to be able to do for them. Also, the partner ecosystem, Noname is very partner friendly. That will really help our go-to-market motion and they were very excited about the news as well. And Ed, I'll turn it over to you for the second part there. Ed McGowan : Yeah, sure. So first of all, just a great quarter for security, great sequential growth, strength across the board really in terms of pretty much all of our solutions, obviously seeing great growth with API security and expect that will accelerate now that we have Noname in the mix. But I think as you look at last year, we had very, very strong sequential growth, sort of unusually strong, including some license revenue in the back half of last year. So the compares get a little bit tougher. I don't think there's anything structurally that we're seeing that would cause us to be less bullish. I think one thing, just to keep in mind, we introduced some bundles last year. We had identified about 3,000 customers or so. Obviously, we had great success with that. That's going to have less of an impact this year as we start to anniversary that. But we are very excited about what we're seeing with Guardicore, which is starting to become more material, and the growth from API security. So we're very bullish with the growth going forward. I think just getting it to tougher comps in the back half, which is going to perhaps cause the percentages to be a little bit lower than what we saw here in Q1. James Fish : Thanks Ed. Operator : The next question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Please go ahead. Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Just one on delivery. You know, I can appreciate how difficult it is to sort of parameterize some of the trends that are playing out in the industry. I think both of you sort of laid that out in the prepared remarks. But how should we think about the floor in terms of declines in this business and what type of GuardRails you're anticipating and putting around this business? And essentially what I'm trying to get around is how confident are you that this recalibration lower does take into consideration everything that's happening in them? And then I have a follow-up. Tom Leighton : Yeah, I'll start and then Ed will give us some more color on this. Of course, you know, when we give guidance, we do it based on the best available information we have at the time. Obviously, we don't like to see, the revenue decline and you never like to be in a position of taking down the guidance for one of your portfolios. We do believe that, you know, our delivery business is critical for major enterprises to operate on the Internet. That said, delivery is a very competitive environment And we are subject to overall traffic levels on the internet, which we now believe will be in a lower state than we had thought before. And you know, this is typical. We've been doing this as the market leader now for 25 years, and there's times, when traffic accelerates more than you might have thought and times when it doesn't. And I think we're in sort of the latter mode right now. Now we do believe the business will get back to par. I can't tell you exactly when that will be. It's important for us to do that. I should add though, it's not our top priority. We are not out there doing whatever price it takes to go grab all the business. In fact, I think we've been pretty clear that's not the case. There's traffic that we are not taking because we don't feel that it's profitable or really strategic for us. Our primary goal is using delivery for very strong cash flow that we can invest in security and compute, which we think are much more lucrative markets in the long run, offering much more growth. And also we use it with our customers to introduce, for example compute. The [big-bit] (ph) customers, big media, gaming, are big prospects in compute. And the largest customers there are over $1 billion in third-party cloud spend, typical large media customer, hundreds of millions. And we want to get a share of that business which is much more profitable and ultimately much larger than delivery. So that is our focus here. Obviously we want to get back to PAR. We don't like to see a declining business but it's a bigger picture. And of course we are competing with a lot of companies that are very desperate just to get a little bit more growth in delivery, and even if they are doing it at a very unprofitable level, and that makes it more challenging. And Ed, maybe you want to talk a little bit more on the details of the guidance and the confidence? Ed McGowan : Yeah, as Tom talked about, we use the best information we possibly can. We obviously work with a lot of the big telcos. We try to get feedback from them to see what they're seeing. We talk to our large customers to get an understanding of what they have planned in terms of the big events or if they're doing downloads, how big the downloads are going to be, what sort of share we should expect as we go through things like our large renewals and that sort of stuff. When we see a trend like we saw in March where traffic was lower than we expected and then continued into April, it did cause us to go back and relook at our forecasts and be a little bit more cautious. But those forecasts, it's unusual to see traffic decline month over month. It doesn't generally happen. But there is a big pressure in the industry to save costs, especially in the streaming business. Gaming tends to be very seasonal and a little fickle in terms of different titles being popular and not. We're just sort of in the downtrend in gaming. But as Tom mentioned, we've seen these trends before. We're usually pretty good at predicting when things will turn around. But when we do see something that is concerning, we're going to call it out and reset our forecast. Fatima Boolani : I appreciate that. And just with regards to the new go-to-market leadership on the compute side, I'm just curious if there are going to be any material changes or is this a deepening of the bench that's going to allow for an ongoing, ideally, acceleration of the compute business? We'd love to just get a little bit more detail on that go-to-market change for someone with a pretty excellent category. Thanks so much. Tom Leighton : Yeah, it's more of the latter and getting really solid experience and expertise as we increase our investment in the go-to-market effort around compute. And we think Dan is an excellent addition to our leadership. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Murphy from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. I wanted to congratulate you on the strength in the Compute and Security and the US Army win the Sony -- win, obviously good things happening there. Going back to the social media company that you referenced, is that a typical kind of [garden variety] (ph) case of cost optimization or is there perhaps anything unusual like a corner case where The clock might be ticking on legislative proposals and they are moving in advance of that. Could it be a social media company that is struggling and shrinking? Anything along those lines? Tom Leighton : No, I think you described it pretty well in the first two descriptions you gave. And they just are a very large customer for Akamai, and a very good customer. They are looking to cut costs and they are looking at potential, geopolitical challenges. And so that, I think a lot of companies look to cut costs, particularly these days in media and maybe they have additional concerns. Mark Murphy : I understand. Okay. And then Ed, the security company you're acquiring, I forget the name of it, can you provide any metrics on the headcount or their growth rate in the last 12 months or the gross margins? And I'm just wondering, does it focus on API security that aligns any more or less across any of the particular hyperscalers? Ed McGowan : Yeah, I'll take the first part, Tom. You can take the second part about the product. Now in terms of growth rates and stuff like that, I hesitate to give growth rates because we obviously have to translate everything they're doing into GAAP revenue ASC 606. But needless to say, they were growing pretty quickly. We talked about we think it will contribute about $20 million of revenue, but again growing very fast as we introduce them into the mix. We think we can accelerate that growth rate quite a bit as we introduce them to our customer base. Gross margins I would say is pretty typical of what you see in a software company. It's called like high 70s, maybe low 80s. There are some people cost that go into your cost of goods sold. As far as people go, right around 250 people, give or take, 60% or so is in R&D, 30% in go-to-market and the rest is sort of mixed in kind of your back-office support. Tom Leighton : Yeah, in terms of the question on the hyperscalers and API security, they don't offer API security. They have API gateways, which is something totally different. In our competition, in API security is more startups or younger companies smaller. It's an emerging field and really we feel Noname as a leader there. Mark Murphy : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great, thank you. Just to go back on the delivery side, was there a price that they would have been willing to stick with? There was just pretty much a business decision there. And Tom, you mentioned get back to PAR. What do you mean by that? Is that a level of revenue? How should we think about what it would be to kind of getting back to PAR? Tom Leighton : Well, PAR, we don't want to see revenue decline in our portfolio. We'd like to see it to grow. And we're declining, obviously, now in delivery. And in the particular case of the large social media company, I don't think, this is a price-related issue, really. And as Ed mentioned, I think pricing, obviously very competitive out there. And we don't go and chase the bottom stuff that's not really profitable for us. But you know, pricing is sort of as we expect and more of it's a traffic, overall traffic in the industry right now. Frank Louthan : Okay, and at what level do you see the delivery business sort of bottoming it out that would be considered sort of flat for you. Ed McGowan : Yeah, you know as Tom talked about, it's hard to predict. I mean, I think what you need to see for that to happen is traffic growth to improve, to see pricing rationalize a bit more than where it is now, and less concentration of big renewals. But that's really the formula that you would need to see a sort of a stabilized delivery business. Frank Louthan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is [Chant] (ph) on for Amit. I just had a quick one on the delivery business. You know, given this is an election year, do you think we could see a step up in the delivery business, maybe in the back half? I think normally elections tend to drive some sort of benefit as well as kind of the Olympic benefits you mentioned earlier. Tom Leighton : Yes, we talked about the Olympics as a decent event for us. Our estimate is $3 million to $4 million this year. As far as the election goes, really hard to tell. You know, we saw back in [2016] (ph) a bit more traffic, [2020] (ph) didn't really drive a ton of traffic. I'd say this is probably closer to what we saw in 2020, so we're not really anticipating a significant amount of traffic as a result of this year's election, but we'll see. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, I think free cash flow is really strong during this quarter, but if I look back historically, Q1 is kind of the low, and then sequentially in the June and September quarter it's much greater. So could you talk about maybe any changes to your CapEx and free cash flow expectations for fiscal 2024? Tom Leighton : Yeah, so I would think that next year should play out, or excuse me, 2024 should play out like it's done in the past. Q1 was a little bit stronger than normal. As we talked about on several calls back last year, we did move some folks to a stock-based bonus program. So we used to have a cash-based bonus program that would play out in Q1 that would drive cash flow down a little bit in Q1, but in terms of the progress throughout the year, it should look like the other years. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks for that. Operator : The next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair & Company. Please go ahead. Jonathan Ho : Hi. Good afternoon. Just wanted to understand the Zero Trust platform that you announced today. Can you talk a little bit about how customers are thinking about purchasing the assembly of products that you're talking about and how that compares with maybe some of the other views on how SASE and other Zero Trust platforms will evolve over time. Tom Leighton : Yeah, this is a really good platform for Zero Trust for enterprise applications. So you get your micro segmentation and your employees Zero Trust Network access which is your employee access. That's your North, South and East, West now combined. Same agents, you don't have to have two different agents, same console and [plane of class] (ph). And on top of it, you get your MFA, your DNS security, and your threat hunting service, all packaged in a platform. And that's something customers have been asking for. It makes their lives a lot easier than having what seem to be different products with different agents and different interfaces. On top of it, at RSA we demonstrated a very cool new capability that actually uses a GenAI, LLMs, to give a very nice human interface into your enterprise infrastructure. It identifies what your various applications and devices are, and you'd sort of think, oh, well people would know, but they don't. Enterprise, major enterprises just have zillions of applications and devices on the internal network and they don't even know what they all are. And this tells you, in actually a human language form, can actually tell you what is not sufficiently protected or if the firewall rules, the agent rules are out-of-date. We've got a lot of positive feedback about that at RSA. And it's something that over time we want to take to our entire suite of security services, which I think will be pretty exciting. So yeah, so this helps because customers want to see, really have a few basic platforms of which Akamai is one and simplification of interface and control, both for the control plane and for the agent that's on their applications and service. Jonathan Ho : Excellent, excellent. And just in terms of a follow-up, with compute, you obviously spoke about a number of large wins here, large types of customers. Can you talk about the potential to take that larger share of the pie over time as you grow within these customers and help us understand, are you landing in sort of a small footprint to begin with and then growing from there? Are you just sort of taking everything up front? I'm just trying to understand what that net retention opportunity looks like over time. Thank you. Tom Leighton : Yeah, great question. It very much is a land small. Somebody will try out a single app with a little of the traffic forward and then grow it, and then add more apps. And you see that with our profile of customers, starting with the ones that $3,000 a month, then half of them now up to [$100,000] (ph) a year, [$60 million] (ph), [$100 million] (ph) a year. And Akamai is actually our first $100 million a year customer on the platform. And that's the same progression we went through over the last year-and-a-half. And we expect, and that's what we're trying to do with all of our accounts. These customers I talked about I couldn't give you most of their names, but you would recognize them. And they are -- what they're spending now with us is a tiny fraction, even the big ones, of their overall cloud spend. And they are finding the platform is easy to use, performs very well, and is saving them a boatload of money. And I think that's why we're seeing such good early traction. And now the goal is to grow those accounts, both in terms of the number of use cases and the scale of a use case, and then to add more customers. And again, they will come in at the lower revenue volumes to start. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Henderson from Needham. Please go ahead. Alex Henderson : Great, thanks. First off, congratulations. Picking off Noname was a real coup for you. I think that's an outstanding acquisition. So congratulations on that. I wanted to ask some content around the compute piece. First, you moved a bunch of your internal apps from other compute platforms to internal. Where are you on that? What does that look like in terms of the cost savings? And what has been the variance relative to what you'd expected when you started it, I assume you probably got better results, not worse results. And I was hoping you could, within the context of the compute platform, talk about gross retention as opposed to net retention. Obviously your net retention looks very good with these upticks, but I was wondering if there was any churn of people who were on the platform before that may have fallen out of the equation? Tom Leighton : Yeah, we're more than halfway through the migration of our third-party cloud spend onto Akamai Connected Cloud. And as I mentioned, seeing really dramatic savings and also performance improvements. So we're more than $100 million a year in on the platform now, which is really fabulous for us. And maybe, Ed you want to take the second part of that question? Ed McGowan : Yeah, so if you think about where you see that, Alex, is there some absolute savings if you look at our \u2013 in our cost of goods sold line, you can see that on that network build and support sub-line, sub-category. It's offset a little bit by what you see in [colocation] (ph) fees. So you're not seeing a ton of margin expansion. But what doesn't show up there is that that line was growing at 30%, 40%, or 50% a year. Now, probably we'd be growing 30%, 40% if we hadn't done it. So the cost avoidance is pretty significant. As Tom said, we're finding this to be much better than we had expected. We should get the rest of the expected applications moved over here between now and the early part of next year, end of this year into the early part of next year. So I'm very, very pleased with that. And again, a lot of cost avoidance and some absolute cost savings, like I said, being a little bit [massive] (ph), investments we're making in the platform. And then you also asked a question on gross retention, I think was the term you used in terms of are we seeing any churn. On the enterprise side, we're not seeing any churn so far. We haven't seen any customers that have left the platform. We do see a little bit of churn in the legacy retail node business which was pretty common when you talked about the SMTs. But where we're really aiming to grow the business, we're not seeing any of that yet. Alex Henderson : Okay, great. And just one last question on this subject. Can you talk about whether you're seeing any potential around inference AI on this platform because it hasn't been mentioned yet. Thanks. Tom Leighton : Oh yeah, we already have several customers doing all sorts of AI, but inference AI on our platform, and we have partners, our ISV partners. Some of them, that's their product capability. So yeah, we foresee substantial use of the platform for inference. Alex Henderson : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Rudy Kessinger from DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger : Hey, Thanks for taking my questions. Ed, just given the quicker than expected mix shift of the higher gross margin revenue lines, why aren't we seeing gross margins at least hold steady, if not expand? It's been compressing for the last few years. Ed McGowan : Yes, so if you look back a few years ago, they've been compressing a bit. We had some pricing pressure as we always do in the delivery business. But I talked a little bit about this a few questions ago, and even a little bit with Alex in the last question. As we invest in the platform to build out compute locations, we're doing the GECO build out. We built out 25 core locations last year. We entered into these long-term leases for colocation. And where there's underlying [commits] (ph), you have to straight line that. So there's some non-cash colocation expenses. So if you look at our [co-loc] (ph) cost line, that's been growing pretty substantially. So that's masking a lot of the savings that you're seeing from our third-party compute costs. There's also additional build out and support costs that go along with it as well. So that's why you're seeing that margin sort of holding flat to where they've been over let's say the last year or so, but I don't expect them to decline. Hopefully over time they should start to expand a bit, but as we're building out aggressively in the compute platform that does put a little bit of pressure on margins, but as we start to fill up those locations, we should start to see expansion in margin. Rudy Kessinger : Yeah, okay. And then on delivery, could you just talk about where some of the repricings came in with some of those contracts? And if I look at kind of what's implied for delivery in the rest of the year on an organic basis adjusting for some of those contracts you acquired, it looks like it kind of probably gets down to down 20%-ish year-over-year on an organic basis. What is the mix of price compression versus traffic growth? Is it flat kind of traffic on the network given all the things you talked about and 20% price compression or what is the combination there? Ed McGowan : Yeah, so we don't share those numbers for obvious reasons with the price compression because obviously there's customers that get certain discounts, others don't get as high discount because they don't have as much traffic. And also it's a competitive number. I'd want to know what my competitors are doing with that number as well. But if I think about sort of the mix of what's driving it. Pricing is always a factor. And if you don't get the commensurate traffic growth offset that, then you're going to decline. And that's what we're seeing. It's really the back-half story is a lower than expected traffic. Now, couple that with your, some of your largest customers renewing at the same time. You don't have that, that volume offset. It just exaggerates the impact at the back half of the year. So like I said, it's really more of a volume issue than it is an overall pricing issue. Tom Leighton : Okay, operator, I think we've got time for one last question. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Blakey from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tom Blakey : Hey, Mark and guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to go back, I think maybe to dive a little deeper on Rudy's question about gross margins. You talk about moving to more profitable solutions longer-term and made some headway here in one queue. In the past, you've kind of given us a framework about lowering CapEx, as a percentage of revenue for CDN. Essentially, 0% CapEx is needed, theoretically anyway, for security. Can you just walk us through what the -- not the near-term manned price components are, but longer-term structurally, what does compute look like at scale for Akamai? And have a follow up. Ed McGowan : Yeah, so good questions. What -- I'll start with what the components of CapEx are today. So we said 16%. About 8% of that is Software CAP, so that's probably going to be 7%, 8% sort of going forward. Don't expect much of a change there. That's kind of been historically in that range. Compute this year is about 4%. CDN and securities around 3%, and then there's always 1% call it first. You know, you're back-off if there's your IT systems and your facility related stuff. So in terms of how that's going to go throughout the years, we've obviously driven down our CapEx on the CDN business pretty dramatically. That used to be sort of 8% to 10% is what we used to talk about. So we've more than cut that in half. And I expect that -- that kind of low single-digit range will probably be where we stay unless we see just a dramatic increase like we saw during the pandemic. But there's no reason to believe that is to happen with what we know about the industry right now. In terms of the compute business, it's really a question of growth. Now we're expanding in terms of the number of locations right now. Obviously, revenue is growing very fastly, we made a big investment last year, and we talked about having room for revenue growth. And obviously, that enterprise revenue growth is quite substantial in terms of year-over-year and getting to more material numbers. Tom and I talked about being on a $50 million run rate just for that and growing it over 300%. Now, we've used kind of a metric of about a $1 of CapEx for a dollar of revenue. Not a perfect metric, but it's not a bad one to use. I've actually looked at some of the hyperscalers and some of the other public information that's available. It's a fairly decent proxy, obviously, as you're making major investments like testing an AI now. But I think that's a fairly decent place to put it for now and then obviously as we get more experience we'll update you from there. Tom Blakey : Okay thanks again for that review and update there. Back to Noname and the kind of setup here so we model it correctly and look at organic growth. Did that $20 million for the back half includes like a cross-sell or uplift from being on the Akamai platform? Is that just kind of annualizing what Noname's revenues are today? And maybe from a strategic perspective for Tom, like is with Noname also purchased to be more of a -- strategic asset in the context of not just API related posture management and bundling there, or is Noname going to be in -- its code base going be more of a hub for bundling more additional security services for Akamai? Tom Leighton : Yeah, I'll just do a quick answer on the second part there. Yeah, Noname is strategic, API security is strategic, and we're looking forward to integrating that more deeply in the Akamai platform and then building on top of it with new capabilities. And Ed, I'll let you talk about the financial. Ed McGowan : Yeah, so what we've baked in really is just essentially what we expect their contribution to be without a significant increase in sales from our revenue synergy. So there's an opportunity to drive additional revenue synergy throughout the back-half of the year. Assumption there is it closes sometime in June. Going to train our sales reps up. It always takes a little while for an acquisition to settle, and then you start opening up sales campaigns and we'll start closing some deals towards the latter part of the year. Hopefully we can do better than that but in terms of our thinking we just sort of layer in what that contribution will be and hopefully we can drive some revenue synergy in addition to that. Tom Blakey : Thanks. Thank you. Tom Leighton : Okay. Thank you, everyone. In closing, we'll be presenting at several investor conferences throughout the rest of the quarter. We look forward to seeing you at those. And thanks again for joining us tonight. We hope you have a nice evening. Operator you can now end the call. Operator : Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions, and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on August 8, 2024. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events, or circumstances, except as required by law. As a reminder, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial metrics today. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. I will now hand the call off to our Co-Founder and CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton. Tom Leighton : Thanks Mark. I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter, Akamai delivered continued strong momentum in compute, strong growth in our security portfolio, steady operating margins and healthy earnings growth on the bottom-line. Second quarter revenue grew to $980 million, up 5% year-over-year as reported and up 6% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.58, up 6% year-over-year and up 9% in constant currency. These results were in line with or above our guidance. Before I provide more color on our performance, I'd like to review how Akamai is evolving as we grow. As most of Akamai first made its name with the invention of content delivery services, and we're still the world's leader in that market today. We stand out for providing the scale and performance required by the world's top brands as we help them deliver reliable, secure and near flawless digital experiences. Recent examples include delivering the Euros football tournament and the summer games in Paris for top broadcasters around the world. As we've said in previous calls, our delivery business has been challenged in recent quarters by macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. Our plan for delivery is threefold. First, we will remain disciplined when it comes to the profitability of traffic that we choose to serve. Second, we will continue to leverage our market leadership position and installed base of major enterprises to generate cross selling opportunities. And third, we will continue to take steps to retain our market leadership while also reinvesting most of the cash flow from our delivery product line into the fast growing areas of the business. In Q2, delivery accounted for one third of our revenue, or $329 million. This is quite a change from five years ago when delivery accounted for two thirds of Akamai revenue. The diversification of our revenue across new markets through continuous innovation has long been a core part of Akamai's strategy for long-term profitable revenue growth. A little more than a decade ago, we expanded our business into security with the creation of web app firewall as a cloud service. We did this to meet what we recognized as a growing customer need in a way that was complementary to what Akamai was already doing for customers with delivery. The opportunity was clear to us because we listened to our customers. We created what has proved to be a very successful cloud service for web app firewall. And now, for the first time in Akamai history, security delivered the majority of Akamai's revenue, $499 million in Q2, up 15% year-over-year and up 16% in constant currency. This amounts to an annual run rate of about $2 billion per year. Of course, we greatly expanded our security product set over the years. We now offer market leading solutions for DDoS prevention, Bot management, account and content protection app and API security, and zero trust enterprise security led by our Guardicore segmentation solution. Customer interest in our security solutions is strong and we had many significant wins in Q2. One of the world's largest energy companies became a new zero trust customer with Akamai. One of the top three airlines in the US is moving from a Legacy VPN architecture to a zero trust architecture. With Akamai, we provided Akamai app and API protector to one of the largest providers of HR management software and services in the US and to German retailers Delife, Douglas, Wagner, and Zalando. EFAFLEX, the German maker of high speed industrial doors, purchased our segmentation solution, as did a major stock exchange and a leading cybersecurity company in Latin America. We provided DDoS protection to one of the largest banks in the world and to a government ministry in the Middle east and at one major electric utility in Southeast Asia. We replaced a well known competitor in a five year deal for our web app firewall, DDoS protection, Bot management, account, takeover prevention, and API security. We're especially excited about the most recent additions to our security portfolio. In Q2, we announced our new Akamai Guardicore platform, the first of its kind to enable zero trust security through a fully integrated combination of micro segmentation, zero trust network access, multi factor authentication, DNS firewall, and threat hunting. Its single agent and unified control console, powered by GenAI, are designed to strengthen and simplify enterprise security with broad visibility and granular controls. The new GenAI interface enables our customers operations teams to ask questions in a human language to gain information about their enterprise networks. The new Akamai Guardicore platform reflects our evolution as a security vendor, growing beyond point solutions to a broader and more comprehensive security offering. Customers tell us they want to consolidate security products and tools with vendors they can trust, and we think this will appeal to their needs. In Q2, we also closed the acquisition of no name security as we accelerate our momentum in the fast growing API security market. IDC forecasts this market will grow at a CAGR of 34% to nearly $1 billion by 2027. With no name, we believe that Akamai now has one of the most comprehensive API security solutions in the industry. Within two weeks of the close, Akamai offered no name customers our new Edge connector, an integration with Akamai web app and API protector that works with a click of a button. No name saw a significant increase in closed deals in Q2, including wins at some of the largest banks and insurance companies in North America and at leading software companies in Europe and Asia. We're also beginning to see a good up-sell motion with early no name adopters. For example, one of the largest US healthcare insurers more than doubled their no name contract in Q2 to over $1.7 million annually. About a decade after we entered the security market, we again expanded Akamai's future opportunity by developing a much broader offering in cloud computing. As many of Akamai has offered function as a service in our edge platform. For many years, this kind of edge computing has been used by thousands of our customers, and it is deeply integrated into our delivery and security services. But our customers asked for more. They wanted us to offer full stack cloud computing so that they could run their VMs and containers on the Akamai platform. And they wanted us to do it in a way that would be more efficient and less costly than comparable offerings provided by the hyperscalers. They wanted Akamai to do this because they were already delivering and securing their sites and apps on our platform. They liked our track record of reliability, and they knew they could trust Akamai to be a good partner. Many of them also liked the fact that we don't compete against them. Unlike the hyperscalers, adding cloud computing to our portfolio also makes good sense for Akamai. In addition to satisfying customer demand, we can reap the advantages from offering customers delivery, security and compute on the same platform. The synergies include improved performance, seamless integration and other operational efficiencies, bundling for cross selling and strong customer retention, increased margins for all of our services, deepening relationships with carrier networks, capacity to quickly detect and stop massive cyberattacks at the edge, unmatched visibility into enormous volumes of traffic and the security insights and threat intelligence that we gain as a result. If you step back and look at how the marketplace has evolved, you can see how the hyperscalers have worked to achieve a similar suite of offerings, although they've taken a different route to get there. They started with cloud computing and infrastructure as a service and then moved into security and delivery, validating our view that there is synergy in offering customers all three together. he hyperscalers also have a more centralized architecture, while Akamai has the world's most distributed cloud platform, with more than 4100 points of presence in over 700 cities across 130 countries. We believe that being more distributed provides customers with better performance, better economics and greater reliability. As we reported in our last earnings call, the initial response from customers to our new cloud offering has been very encouraging. The strong early momentum that we achieved in Q one continued in Q2, with compute revenue growing to $151 million, up 23% year-over-year and up 24% in constant currency. New compute customers added in Q2 include one of the world's best known media and entertainment brands based here in the US, the European cybersecurity company Sekoia.io, Clara Video, the video brand of the biggest Telco in Latin America, MwareTV, a technology platform for IPTV and OTT services and a cable satellite IPTV provider that reaches almost half the households in Australia. Customers are also leveraging our ISV partners, which we call qualified compute partners, to run low latency workloads on our compute platform. These include solutions for observability into workload behavior, cybersecurity and large scale events where the need to store very large sets of data makes Akamaya more attractive and cost effective option than competitors. Our media customers can now take advantage of a full suite of media workflow offerings on Akamai connected cloud, which provides valuable synergy with our delivery platform for more efficient image manipulation, decisioning and video transcoding. And with Akamai's latest qualified compute partner and customer Yospace, media companies around the globe can leverage their advanced ad tech and ad strategies at scale across the Akamai connected cloud. Customers are also building new apps on our platform where low latency data distribution and processing provides a better user experience for their customers at significantly reduced cost. One customer is training and testing the machine learning engines that power their security scanning product. Another is building an AI powered Chatbot application to improve their customer experience and streamline operations with intelligent, conversational customer engagement. Such AI powered applications are increasingly popular with recent advances in large language models. Akamai is also a very large user of our new cloud solution. As a result of migrating most of our own apps from the hyperscalers to Akamai connected cloud, we're seeing better performance and greatly reduce cost. In fact, we expect to reduce our spending on third party clouds to less than a third of what it would have been this year had we stayed on the hyperscalers, saving us well over $100 million in annual OpEx. It sure feels good not writing a nine figure check to your competitors every year, and this is a feeling that we look forward to providing to our large enterprise customers. In summary, Akamai has undergone a fundamental transformation. We transformed from a content delivery pioneer into the cloud company that powers and protects life online. Compute and security now generate two thirds of our revenue, and we believe that they provide Akamai with excellent potential for future growth and profitability. And we've achieved this transformation while successfully maintaining robust margins. Because both of our fast growing product areas, our large security portfolio, and our rapidly growing cloud computing portfolio, are built upon and enabled by the foundation of our business, our highly efficient and massively distributed delivery platform. Our near term operating margin goal remains 30%, and we see potential margin upside over time as the fast growing areas of the business expand our profitability. Looking back at the first half of 2024. We're pleased by our strong performance in security and compute. Looking ahead, we're very excited about our potential for future growth as we integrate noname and as our fast growing compute offerings continue to gain traction with customers. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our Q2 results and our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you Tom. Today I plan to review our Q2 results and then provide some color on our expectations for Q3 in the full year. Turning to our second quarter results, total revenue for the second quarter was $980 million, up 5% year-over-year as reported, and 6% in constant currency. Compute revenue was $151 million, up 23% year-over-year as reported, and 24% in constant currency. We continue to be very pleased with the level of enthusiasm in the market as more and more customers are leveraging our enterprise compute solutions. In particular, we are seeing a broad array of enterprise compute use cases including live transcoding, secure access, observability, object storage, real time log aggregation and insight spatial computing and deep learning AI models across many verticals including media, e-commerce, software and financial services. Moving to security revenue in the second quarter, security revenue was $499 million, up 15% year-over-year as reported, and 16% in constant currency. We're very pleased by the continued performance of our Guardicore Zero trust solution and highly encouraged by the traction we are seeing in our recently launched API security solution. It's worth noting that the no name transaction closed in late June and the revenue contribution in the second quarter was less than $1 million. Combined, compute and security revenue grew 17% year-over-year as reported, and 18% in constant currency, representing 66% of total revenue. Moving to delivery revenue was $329 million, which declined 13% year-over-year as reported, and 12% in constant currency. The decline in delivery revenue was primarily related to the revenue impacting items that I outlined last quarter and was in line with our expectations. International revenue was $471 million, up 3% year-over-year and up 5% in constant currency, representing 48% of total revenue in Q2, foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $5 million on a sequential basis and a negative $10 million impact on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $243 million, or $1.58 of earnings per diluted share, up 6% year-over-year and up 9% in constant currency, and our non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 29%. Moving now to cash and our use of capital as of June 30. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.9 billion during the second quarter. We spent approximately $128 million repurchasing approximately 1.4 million shares. We now have an aggregate of roughly $2.3 billion remaining in our share buyback authorizations. We also used approximately $450 million in cash in the second quarter for the acquisition of no name. As it relates to our use of capital, our intention remains the same to continue buying back shares over time, to offset dilution from employee equity programs, and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases. Before I provide our Q3 and updated full year 2024 guidance, I want to touch on some housekeeping items. First, regarding the close of the no name security acquisition, we expect this transaction to add approximately eight to $10 million of revenue in Q3, approximately $18 to $20 million in revenue for the full year 2024. We also expect it to be dilutive to non-GAAP EPS by approximately four to $0.05 for the full year 2024, and to be dilutive to non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 30 basis points to 40 basis points in 2024. As a reminder, our updated full year guidance includes the impact of the acquisition. Second, and specific to traffic, we expect a modest uptick in year-over-year traffic in Q3, primarily due to the Paris Summer Games. This event is expected to drive approximately three to $4 million of additional revenue in the third quarter, and while Q4 is typically our strongest quarter seasonally, we saw a more muted impact of that seasonality last year, and we expect to see a similar result this year. Third, the country of India recently announced plans to eliminate its digital service tax effective as of August 1, 2024. We are working with our tax advisors to determine the full impact of this tax change on our non-GAAP effective tax rate. Based on our initial assessment, we believe this could result in a small increase in our effective non-GAAP tax rate, and we have adjusted our guidance accordingly. Finally, the macroeconomic environment remains challenging and geopolitical tensions persist. Any negative developments could have a meaningful impact on our business. So with those factors in mind, I'll move to our Q3 guidance. For Q3, we're projecting revenue in the range of $988 million to $1.008 billion, or up 2% to 4% as reported, and 3% to 5% in constant currency over Q3 2023. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $2 million impact on Q3 revenue compared to Q2 levels and a negative $5 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 73%. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $307 million to $312 billion. We expect Q3 EBITDA margin of approximately 42%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $129 million to $131 million and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% for Q3. Moving on to CapEx, we expect to spend $166 million to $174 million. This represents approximately 17% of our projected total revenue. Based on our expectations for revenue and costs, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPs in the range of CPs. Guidance assumes taxes of $59 million to $60 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19% to 20%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 154 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we now expect revenue of which is up four to 5% year-over-year as reported, and up five to 6% in constant currency at current spot rates. Our guidance assumes foreign exchange will have a negative $20 million impact to revenue in 2024. On a year-over-year basis, we continue to expect security revenue growth of approximately 15% to 17% in constant currency in 2024, including the contribution from the acquisition of no name. And given the strong momentum and adoption from both new and existing enterprise compute customers, we now expect enterprise compute annualized revenue run rate to double from the $50 million we reported last quarter to over $100 million as we exit 2024. As a result, we are now increasing our overall expected compute revenue growth to approximately 23% to 25% in constant currency for the full year 2024. Moving to profitability, we estimate non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of our non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19% to 20% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 154 million shares. Finally, our full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 16% of total revenue. In closing, we are pleased with the traction we are seeing in enterprise compute and look forward to helping our customers migrate services to the Yakamai connected cloud. Thank you. Tom and I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. The first question today comes from Patrick Colville with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Patrick Colville : Thank you so much for taking my question. Frank and Ed, really great to be part of the hack. My story I want to talk about the business makes shift. I mean, that's where you opened your prepared remarks. Specifically, I want to focus on compute. The $100 million revenue you just called out from Akamai connected cloud is really compelling and great to see that ramping. When might that hockey stick to become an even greater revenue base? What's the trajectory of Akamai connected cloud over the coming quarters? And if we think out beyond that? Tom Leighton : Yes, great question. And I got to say, we were very pleased to see the rapid early adoption. that's a capability that we really just started selling in earnest this year. We had some very early adopters towards the end of last year. And, if we can get up to $100 million ARR by the end of the year, which we think we're going to do, that's great, for the first year of the product, and then we'll see where we are at the beginning. Next year, we'll give guidance in February for the year in compute, but we're very optimistic about strong growth in compute driven by the enterprise customers and our new capability. There's an enormous market there, obviously, and so we're really looking forward into tapping into that. Patrick Colville : Very helpful. Thank you. I guess the second part of my question I want to ask about delivery this year. You've been very clear about the headwinds to the delivery business in 2024. I appreciate you might not want to give guidance beyond 2024, wondering whether the headwinds we're seeing right now are cyclical headwinds or are they structural in nature? Thank you. Tom Leighton : Yes, I don't think what we're seeing today persists over the long term. traffic, I think, will grow, continue to grow maybe at a little bit of a slower rate, than it did certainly during the COVID times. But, delivery, I believe, is here to stay. We are intent on remaining the market leader by a good margin. It's a very profitable business for us. We're very careful about that. We're very efficient in what we do. And it's very synergistic, with our security web app firewall business and our emerging compute business. So I don't see these headwinds persisting over the long term. There are geopolitical considerations that we're worried about, for next year. But I don't think this is a long-term phenomenon. And in any case, given the very fast growth of our security and compute product lines, they've nearly trickled in revenue over the last five years. So now where they're two thirds of our revenue overall, I think the, what you see with delivery, with sometimes challenges, sometimes good, it has a lot less impact on the overall growth rate as we go forward. Ed, do you have anything you want to add to that? Ed McGowan : No, I think you covered it well. Operator : The next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan family. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on the solid quarter. And I wanted to ask you a little bit about kind of parsing out the guidance, particularly the full year guidance. If I'm doing my math right, the midpoint of the full year comes up by about $5 million for the full year. But we're adding or no names. It sounds like about $20 million in revenues for the full year. Is there a part of the equation that's coming down, a part of the business that you're getting more cautious on? That makes up that difference? Ed McGowan : No, Keith? Yes. So we included no name in our guidance last quarter as well. So there's nothing that's changed. If anything, the business has gotten a little bit better. So our guidance has come up a bit to reflect that. Keith Weiss : Got it, got it. And then on the expense side of the equation, the savings from moving sort of in house from the hyperscaler is $100 million is real savings. Congratulations on that. That's quite a feat. Tom, you talked about the ability to sort of start pushing that more into operating margins in the near future. Can you give us an indication of what near future means? 2025 near future, or are we thinking two or three years out or further? Tom Leighton : Well, Yes, the saving, operating savings we're getting, as Ed said, we've been plowing that back into the business by and large so that we can invest in growth. There's more savings to come there, but we really get the upward pressure on margins, the beneficial tailwinds on margins as the mix shift continues. As we add compute customers, that is good margin for us. And it's accretive security as we add customers there, it's accretive. Now, as Ed noted that today with the new security products, initially they're dilutive, but as we grow the revenue there, every customer we add, every deal we sign improves margins. So that over time, 30% is our goal, we're very close to that today, but over time, we think we have good potential to grow beyond that. Operator : The next question comes from John DiFucci with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. John DiFucci : Thank you. I have a question on Guardicore. So, segmentation broadly seems like it's becoming more relevant in the market. Customers are more accepting of it. It's no longer like a new thing, and it has been for a while, and you guys have been there, and you bought God of a couple of years ago, but frankly, it seems like an essential component to a zero trust environment. Not everybody has it. So can you talk a little bit more about how about this business, but really about your Akamai Guardicore Zero trust platform that you just launched a few months ago, and how that sort of fits in the ecosystem of some of an enterprise when they need to protect all their assets to establish that zero trust environment. Because it always seemed to me that this was essential, like I said, for zero trust. I guess if you can also, in addition to the technologies and what else it fits in with, can you also hit on your channel efforts regarding this platform? Because I know this is sold through the channel. I think, Ed, you said this before, but it seems like a really sophisticated solution. It's not just you're buying a firewall for somebody or something like that. If you can just talk a little bit about how. I know it's only, it's early, but how that's working through the channel? Tom Leighton : Yes. I think you characterized it very well. Segmentation is essential, I mean you got to lock the doors in the windows as best you can, but now we're still gets in. And I think really the most important thing an enterprise can do is lock down everything inside and that means Guardicore. It means having your agent on every application on every device. And you're right, most enterprises don't have it. When you go back a few years, and I think the community of large really disfavored segmentation. And that's because the way it was done back then was really crude. You did it in hardware, it's very inflexible, hard to do. And at the end of the day, if you did it at all, you had giant segments which defeated the whole purpose. You weren't very secure because the malware would get in and wipe out an entire giant segment and you had a big problem. And Guardicore solved that problem through software, very easy to manipulate, make updates much more secure, fine green controls. And so it's been an education process for us in the marketplace. We viewed it as something that was going to be essential and that, I think, is proving out, as you noted. And of course, with the ransomware headlines and disasters, it's not surprising to see why people are waking up to what they really do need this. So now the next question is with the platform. And there, what we've done is combine the Guardicore, which is protecting inside app-to-app device-to-device communication with the employee device to internal applications. And so we've combined what's called North, South and East, West. Now again, you go back a few years ago, they were different buyers and treated differently. But then we were thinking back then, boy, it's going to make sense to put this all together and sure enough, we're now seeing customers say, \"Hey, we want that on the same platform. We want a single agent, not 2 different agents and we got to deal with a single control panel so that the business logic can be applied to employee devices at the same way and the same time as it is to internal applications.\" And so that's what the Guardicore platform is all about. We actually also combine it with DNS firewall, multifactor authentication, threat-hunting capabilities so that you can tell when you've got now where it is, what's going on into a platform which customers are excited about. And I think it's important not to underestimate the importance of a single agent to do this because that's really important real estate. And the new control panel powered by Gen AI, it's actually pretty cool. You can converse in a human language, if you will, with your network infrastructure. You get much greater visibility probably much better compliance as a result, which means better security. Now your channel question, yes, Guardicore is all channel. And you're right, it is a sophisticated integration and deployment. It's not just like throw a firewall out there. And that's where the partners can really add value. And so in some cases, in many cases, the partner will derive even more revenue than Akamai will. And it's ongoing because you're growing your Guardicore, your segmentation footprint to include more applications and devices, and it's great for partners when they can add value and generate revenue. So it's a really good channel-friendly product. And of course, not easy to do per se, but a lot easier than the way segmentation used to be. John DiFucci : And if I could, Tom, because that all makes a ton of sense to me. But it also raises the question, like, what are people -- what do they do? What are the alternatives? Like I'm familiar with Illumio and as another company, I've seen called Truxport but like you said, like people don't lot of enterprises don't even have segmentation implemented. So a lot of do, but a lot don't. And so what are the -- are there other things that we're just -- that I'm just missing like I don't know, is Palo buy the whole Palo platform. Are they just saying, you don't need it? Or we have something that kind of does it? Like I'm just trying to -- because the opportunity is just seems really big here? Tom Leighton : No, I think it is a big opportunity. And very few, relatively speaking, enterprises have it today, the early adopters are the critical infrastructure companies because they really, really have to have it. And we do compete with Illumio. They're probably our leading competitor. We believe the Guardicore solution is a lot better. We actually have our own mini firewall in the Asia. We don't have to rely on the firewall in the OS, which sometimes won't be there, it might not be consistent. We can cover a lot of the legacy systems which that's important to enterprises to get more universal coverage. I think there is a ton of greenfield. And I wouldn't be there when one of the other competitors is talking about their platforms. They probably don't spend a lot of time talking about segmentation because they don't really have a solution for it. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thank you very much. Mark Murphy : Ed, what is your latest thinking on the FX headwind to the full year revenue forecast. I'm just curious if there's been any movement there from, I think, previously, you've been looking at that as, I believe, $40 million headwind. Ed McGowan : Mark, yes, not much of a change. The dollar moved around quite a bit during the quarter, up and down, but it's pretty much exactly the same. So for the full year, it's about $40. I gave the guidance already in the quarter in terms of the impact quarter-over-quarter and for year-over-year, but it's still about the same, just around 40 for the full year. Mark Murphy : Okay. And then, Tom, as a quick follow-up, you mentioned a pretty wide array of the workload types that you're seeing on your cloud computing platform. And you mentioned toward the end, deep learning and AI models. I'm wondering if you can double-click on that, for instance. What are the types of model? Are you seeing LLM, the text models or image models or something else? And is it possible to estimate what percentage of your cloud ARR might be relating to those newer types of AI workloads? Tom Leighton : Yes. Great question. I would say today, AI workload is probably a small fraction of the ARR. I think over time, potential for growth there. As we talked about useful in security, applications, chatbots, tailoring content for commerce companies, ad targeting, recommendation engines. I would say that the models are smaller because they're more focused. The giant models sort of are used to learn everything, your chat GPT, you can ask it any question at all, have it try to be knowledgeable about everything. Those are giant models and we're not really targeting that business. But for our customer base, they tend to be a lot more focused on what they're trying to do. Maybe it's a commerce site, maybe it's an ad site, maybe it's a security company. And they don't need to learn the whole world to really provide value. In fact, we see that with our own solution with the Akamai Guardicore platform with the control interface, powered by Gen AI. Really, it's a very specific application, which means that you don't need the gigantic model to really provide the value. And that means it doesn't have to run on this giant suite of GPUs, it can run just great on our platform, which has GPUs but primarily CPU-based, which gives us much better ROI. And that works great for what our customers are looking to do in terms of their AI applications. Operator : The next question comes from Madeline Brooks with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Madeline Brooks : Hi team, thanks for taking my questions. I want to continue on the discussion of Connected Cloud and you mentioned some nice wins in enterprise outside of your traditional CDN customers. But I guess I just wanted to double click on that and kind of get a little bit of color. What are those customers for nonmedia, non-e-commerce. What are the use cases that those customers are finding from Connected Cloud? And if you could just help us break out to growth of those customers maybe versus growth of your more traditional customers? Are they growing around the same in terms of their adoption of Connected Cloud? Tom Leighton : Yes, we're seeing growth both within the base and outside the base. I think, for example, with our qualified compute partner program with observability, a lot of companies need that to know what's going on with their applications. Security companies would need that. Now we also have a lot of media customers. And I would say that's probably the biggest segment today. We have, by design, a full media workflow ecosystem now supported through our QCP program on the platform and so a lot of media customers starting to take advantage of that. Outside of that, for example, OS and firmware patch storage, personalized waiting room experience, improved page performance with hints and so forth. We talked about with AI tailoring the site for a user based on what they've been doing so far. Real-time log aggregation and insights into your logs, observability, kinds of things. We even have a PBX, a telephone switching system running on it, 5G Internet gateway running on it. So it does broaden the base which is, I think, exciting for us in the future. But today, probably the biggest segment would be media. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Please go ahead. Alex Henderson : Great. First off, I think congratulations to an order on the great results out of both security and out of the compute. And I wanted to focus a little bit on the compute side of the business because I think, ultimately, that's the area that needs to be proven out to the Street more than anything else. Can you talk a little bit about the mechanics around what portion of the customer base that's converting to compute is coming from internal? What portion of the compute are true new customers? How many -- how much of the growth is coming from existing customers that are increasing their upsell? Just kind of look at it as if it was a traditional stand-alone business and give us some of those critical metrics that go into analyzing the success of that business? Tom Leighton : Yes. I'll take our first half and turn it over to Ed. And the answer will be pretty similar to the last question. I would say our biggest users and the biggest segment for compute today is our large media customers. And that's by design. And our -- a lot of our QCP, our Quality Compute Partners are media workflow companies. So that's sort of the biggest segment. I would say observability as a capability, a very large one as well, and that spans across all verticals and would include new customers. So we do have a bunch of customers in nontraditional Akamai verticals that are using compute. And I think over the longer run, that opens up a whole new market verticals for us. But the biggest chunk today would be existing Akamai media companies is the biggest. And Ed, do you want to add some color on that? Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. Alex, so as Tom mentioned, we're seeing growth in both existing applications for stuff that's been on the platform for a while, but the bulk of the growth is actually coming from new customers. The new customer additions is growing very, very quickly. We broke out some numbers for you last quarter, and that continues to ramp very nicely. And we're seeing a significant increase in the pipeline. We are seeing some new customers come to the platform. And what's interesting is we're probably seeing more workloads and repeatable workloads in areas even -- Tom talked about media, but outside of media. And we're seeing customers that may be relatively small CEM customers are fairly large compute customers. So I'd say it's across the board where we're seeing the growth, but it's mostly from adding new customers to the mix and then they start to ramp. Operator : The next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citi. Please go ahead Fatima Boolani : I wanted to be in on the delivery guidance and the expected performance in the back half. So appreciate you experienced a lot of the traffic degradation patterns in the first half. But I'm just curious why the trajectory of the business is actually worsening in the back half? And then I have a follow-up for Tom, please. Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So I talked a little bit about the expectations for Q4. Just based on what we're seeing now in terms of traffic growth and what we saw last year, we're not expecting the normal hockey stick to any significant degree like we've seen in prior years. And also keep in mind, we closed the transaction with StackPath and Lumen last year, and that's all delivery revenue. So that makes sure Q4 tougher comparison if you're looking at sort of year-over-year growth rates, that's going to skew your perspective a bit. And as we talked about on the last call, there were some dynamics going on with one of our larger social media customers. The good news there is we've got a good handle on that. That's sort of playing out as we expected. But as we talked about, those are the factors that as you put that into your model, why it may look like it's deteriorating a little bit. But I'd say the biggest issue is the fact that you're anniversary-ing the StackPath and move contribution from Q4 last year. Fatima Boolani : That makes sense. That's very fair. And Tom, for you, I think you've been very constructive around the compute opportunity. There are so many specific examples of the momentum you've been garnering in the compute franchise. But taking a step back as a broader strategy question for you, as you think about scaling that franchise and have it becoming an even bigger part of the overall revenue story. How are you straddling this notion of not using compute as -- or essentially ensuring compute ends up being wallet share accretive against your base as opposed to potentially managing a situation in which the delivery franchise sort of bumps along and compute sort of plugging the hole? Just what are some of the mechanisms you have in place to continue to drive the actual wallet share growth and accretion within existing delivery customers from where you are extracting a lot of net new compute demand for now? Tom Leighton : Yes. Compute is different than delivery. So it's not a situation where delivery revenue was going into compute. That's not the case here. And that compute opportunity is orders of magnitude bigger than the delivery opportunity. And so I think, over time, it becomes a much bigger business than delivery. And I think delivery does its thing and it's a very good business for us in terms of cash generation, in terms of cross-selling. And in terms of actually of the economics of the platform, so we can go out there and offer compute at and especially for chatty applications and applications where data is moving around at a much lower price point than the hyperscalers because we have the delivery platform, but it doesn't -- it's not a situation where it's plugging a hole in delivery. I think compute is a huge revenue growth driver for us in the future, independent of anything in delivery. Operator : The next question comes from Jim Fish with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead Unidentified Analyst : This is Quinton on for Jim Fish. Maybe touching on that first question there. A competitor in the space recently talked about pricing pressures from some of the largest medium customers getting worse over the past couple of months. Are you seeing those pricing trends in the market that's maybe driving some of that second half weakness alongside, obviously, the StackPath and Lumen impact? Or are you not really seeing these pressures given your decision to move away from these kind of lower margin delivery opportunities? Ed McGowan : Quinton, this is Ed. As we talked about, we had some large renewals this year. So obviously, those we've been through all those, and there is certain pricing pressure there. I'd say it's nothing different than what we've traditionally seen in the marketplace. I wouldn't say that it's significantly worse. I think the issue is just not as much traffic growth. So as you reprice a customer, you tend to see significant traffic growth. So the revenue declines don't persist as long as they have in a situation like this. So I wouldn't say if anything has changed in terms of the trajectory of the pricing. It's always been very competitive, it always will be. So that's really not the issue. The issue is just we're not seeing the type of traffic growth that we normally see. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. That's really helpful. And then obviously, it's still really early here with the Noname acquisition. But any update you can provide on the integration between Noname and your kind of existing Neosec API opportunity? And maybe how you balance that go-to-market of those two platforms and how you can kind of leverage a full suite to kind of grow the wallet here within a customer. Tom Leighton : Yes, we are now going to market with Noname. And as I mentioned, within 2 weeks of the close, we had a fully integrated with Akamai products, existing Akamai products, in particular, our web app firewall where a lot of the APIs would go through that. So I would say we're basically integrated today. We have some Neosec customers who we are maintaining over time, that will evolve into the Noname product with some of the capabilities from Neosec, so we get the best of both worlds. Ed McGowan : Yes. Just to add the -- just add the Noname acquisition came with a pretty sophisticated channel as well as a number of specialists. So we have both of those, so that's going to help drive some sales. And actually, from the minute we announced the close to when we closed or announced the deal ultimately closed, we saw a nice pickup in deals closed. So not no impact on the funnel and the teams already out there selling. So very excited about that. I think we've just enhanced our go-to-market capability as part of the acquisition. Operator : The next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead. Jonathan Ho : Hi. Good afternoon. As you listen to customers and what they need or want from the compute side of things. Are there any core services or capabilities that you feel like you're missing or you're going to add pretty soon that are maybe potentially catalyst for even faster adoption? Tom Leighton : I think probably the biggest difference today would be the size of the marketplace. Obviously, the hyperscalers have an enormous marketplace and we're getting started there. We're really excited that I think now we have a very competitive media workflow marketplace. I think we've got a very competitive observability marketplace. And that's something that we're going to be continuing to grow. We're also building out, as you know, our distributed compute capabilities so that we'll be in more locations than in many locations where the hyperscalers don't have a presence, which will give us an advantage in performance and also in countries where you've got data sovereignty laws. We'll be in a better position to handle that. But it's yes, it's ongoing. We're continuing to develop and improve the platform, including with storage, a lot of effort going on there too. So that's going to be -- that will be ongoing for the foreseeable future. But if you can tell from the results, we're in a position now, we can get out there and be selling it. And it's great to see the rapid early adoption. Jonathan Ho : That makes a ton of sense. Just in terms of the delivery business, as we continue to see this decline as a percentage of revenue, it seems to be carrying the business in terms of margins. How concerned are you over deleveraging effects and CapEx efficiency as we see sort of the two sides of the business move in opposite directions? Ed McGowan : Yes, I said it's not a huge concern there. The margins of the new products are very high gross margin products, so that will be helpful. Sure the compute business is a bit more capital intensive. But we've been able to drive down the CapEx of the core business and delivery pretty dramatically. So you're down low single digits as a percentage of revenue for that business. That will maintain as long as the delivery, as long as traffic is not growing significantly. And part of our strategy and being more selective of the type of peak traffic to average that we're taking on the platform is by design, is to make sure that we do maintain that efficiency as we're spending more CapEx in the compute business, and we're not taking on that sort of not as profitable peak to average type traffic so that we can maintain a low CapEx posture in the delivery business. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead Timothy Horan : Kind of a few part question on cloud. Can you use your own platform? It sounds like you're moving a lot of legacy services on there to create kind of, you think, unique services for yourself and new services or improve legacy services on that platform. And then secondly, if you look at Microsoft, Google Cloud flare, they're kind of growing cloud in the 30% range. Do you think you can kind of get there? And are you kind of maybe CapEx constrained to do that? Or just maybe talk about how you can kind of get up to your peers there. And what do you have to do in the SMB market to hit that type of 30% growth? Tom Leighton : Yes. On the first question, we have built capabilities for ourselves as part of our migration. So we're off of Snowflake and Data bricks which we had big spends there. Looking at over time, making our capabilities available to customers, again, a service that is more efficient, which I think is really important for customers. In terms of the growth rate, I would say that you want to compare the enterprise compute number, which we've talked about was a $50 million ARR at the end of Q1. We think that will more than double by the end of the year. That's sort of the number you want to look at that's comparable. We've got more in the overall compute number, but those are -- have products like image and video manager, legacy Akamai net storage, other kinds of things. which aren't as comparable for what you're looking at in terms of the hyperscaler growth. So if you focus on the enterprise compute, which is really going to be the growth driver for us, that's going in a very fast percentage now and, of course, on a much, much smaller number than the hyperscalers. Ed, do you have -- want to add to that? Ed McGowan : No, I think that's exactly right. And that's something that, over time, as that number becomes more material, we'll start to break that out for folks to make it easy for you to see where that growth is coming from. But Tom is absolutely right. That's where the big market is. That's where we're seeing the explosive growth, and we see that we think that can continue. Obviously, the pipeline is growing. We're seeing a lot more use cases than we expected. I see a great participation from all of our reps across the world. It's not just one geo. So we're very excited about it. Timothy Horan : And do you think you're capital constrained at all or product constrained at all in the enterprise there? Ed McGowan : No, I don't think there's a capital constraint problem. I mean you could envision perhaps as a customer that may come to us with a big task where you may have to do some build out if it's in a particular concentrated geography. But we got a very strong balance sheet. We produce a ton of free cash flow. So there's no issue from a capital constraint perspective. I think we can grow this business to a significant size over time, and I don't think capital is a problem right now. Operator : The next question comes from Rudy Kessinger with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger : Hey, great. Thanks for taking my questions on security. I guess in the second half, if I look at it adjusting out Noname, it looks like organic growth at constant currency is just about 11% to 12%. Obviously, it's been a slowdown versus the last several quarters. And in general, the security growth rate has kind of been pretty volatile over the last 5 to 6 quarters. Could you just give us the puts and takes on maybe some tough compares in the second half. I think you had some spike in DDoS strength last year. But also just going forward, just what's the kind of right growth range that we should expect out of the security business? Ed McGowan : Yes, sure. So just in terms of some of the puts and takes, just remember, last year, in Q3, we had little over $6 million of license revenue, that's a couple of percentage points. So that's going to make your Q3 compare a little bit more challenging. The other thing to keep in mind, too, last year, we introduced some new security bundles for web app firewall that did phenomenally well. So we've anniversaried that, so that makes sure our compare is a little bit more challenging. And then between Guardicore and API security as they start to ramp, we think APIs going to ramp very, very quickly. It's just a smaller number. So as you've talked about, the growth has bounced around a little bit over time. That happens as you bring new products into the market and they start to ramp up, think about when we brought [ Batman ] manager to the market. It was a small product and then go to hundreds of millions of dollars. I think the same thing you'll see with Guardicore and API security. Rudy Kessinger : Yes. Okay. And then on the delivery outlook, I guess, your -- I mean, fastly, I'll say it more directly, I mean, they certainly seem to indicate that outside, it was broader than just one social media customer has several large media customers that seem to be shifting traffic to lower-cost providers. It sounds like you guys aren't really seeing that dynamic or maybe it's not the year and it was already factored into the guide. Any comment on that? Ed McGowan : Yes. No, we're not seeing a phenomenon of someone moving to low-cost providers. As a matter of fact, there's two less of them in the market today. So we're not seeing that. As I talked about earlier, we have a tough compare with a [indiscernible] Q4. And then we've just seen just a lower traffic year. Gaming has been unusually weak, video traffic isn't as robust as it normally is. That stuff happens from time to time, but we're not seeing a shift to low-cost providers or any new low-cost providers in the market. Operator : Okay. The last question today comes from William Power with Baird. Unidentified Analyst : This is Yan Samilton for Will. Ed, just going back to that more muted Q4 seasonality you're expecting for delivery again this year. If I remember correctly, last year, you were pointing to weaker trends in retail, including an uptick in bankruptcies there and then also weaker in terms of gaming. And now I know it's probably still a little early to forecast though, but is it those same verticals where you're expecting weaker traffic again this year that you're informing your expectation? Or is it some others or maybe it's more broad-based? Ed McGowan : Yes. I'd say it's a combination of those two verticals. We've seen sort of over time the retail seasonal or to be less and less. Some of that has to do with the Zero overage product that we offer in the market. But just in general, it just hasn't been as robust as have been, say, 4 or 5 years ago. And then from gaming, yes, still weak. I haven't seen any major launches or we're not hearing anything from our customers that we leave me to believe that Q4 will be strong from that perspective. And then also, as I just talked about several times here, just traffic in general has been a bit sluggish from a growth perspective in general. So I don't see anything that tells me that, that's going to change going into Q4. So obviously, we've got a few months to go here before we get there. We'll update you when we talk again in November. But based on what I'm seeing today, just out of this worthwhile calling that out to folks as they build out their models. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Stoutenberg for closing remarks. Mark Stoutenberg : Thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at several investor conferences throughout the rest of the quarter and the rest of the year. We look forward to seeing you with those. We hope everyone has a nice evening tonight. Operator, you may now end the call. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day. And welcome to the Akamai Technologies Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call [Operator Instructions]. Please note that today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Stoutenberg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Stoutenberg : Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining Akamai's third quarter 2024 earnings call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements included on this call represent the company's view on November 7, 2024. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information or future events, except as required by law. As a reminder, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the Financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. I'll now hand the call off to our CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton. Tom Leighton : Thanks, Mark. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered a solid third quarter in which we achieved two significant milestones. For the first time, Akamai's total annual revenue run rate exceeded $4 billion and our security annual revenue run rate exceeded $2 billion. Our compute results were also very strong, growing 28% year-over-year in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.59 in line with our guidance. On last quarter's earnings call, we reviewed how Akamai is undergoing a fundamental transformation from a content delivery pioneer into the cybersecurity and cloud computing company that powers and protects business online. Security now delivers the majority of Akamai revenue and compute and security combined account for more than two thirds of our revenue. Since entering the security market a little more than a decade ago with web app firewall as a cloud service, we greatly expanded our security product set into an impressive portfolio, covering infrastructure, application and enterprise network security. We now offer market leading solutions to help protect against DDoS and DNS attacks, application and API attacks, account abuse and fraud and ransomware and data exfiltration attacks. We're already leveraging generative AI to enhance the security and ease of use of our Guardicore and WAF solutions. And we set ourselves apart from the competition with our extensive threat visibility and intelligence and our expert managed services that customers rely upon to protect their businesses. Customer interest in our security solutions remained strong in Q3 and we signed many significant contracts, including a $70 million agreement with one of the world's largest financial institutions, which included our Guardicore segmentation solution, API Security and Prolexic DDoS protection; a $6 million upgrade at one of the world's leading chemical producers that included Guardicore to increase visibility and better protect against ransomware; a $3 million expansion with one of the world's leading auto manufacturers that included Guardicore to protect their critical high performance computing clusters; a $5 million upgrade from another of the world's largest financial institutions to protect their apps and APIs from malicious activity; and a competitive takeaway for our new API security solution at one of the world's largest multinational technology companies. As a result of the strong early momentum, our new API security solution is on track to achieve an annualized revenue run rate of more than $50 million by the end of the year. And our Zero Trust segment, led by Guardicore, is on track to achieve an annualized revenue run rate of more than $180 million by year end. We're also seeing strong interest in our Prolexic service as a result of the large DDoS attacks that have been raging across Asia. Our State of the Internet report in September warned of how geopolitical tensions are increasing the risks of attacks. And we recently thwarted two of the largest DDoS attacks ever seen, one against a leading financial institution in the Middle East and the other against a popular generative AI service. In both cases, our customers didn't see any impact, thanks to our protection. The GenAI customer, a well known hyperscaler, told us that the enterprise grade protection we provide to their business is a true differentiator and it's why they partner with Akamai over competing vendors who have struggled when confronted with large attacks. As another example, a major financial institution in Australia called on us last month for emergency assistance when the competitor they were using for security failed in the face of an attack, resulting in a significant disruption to their business and painful news headlines. We also signed up one of the leading financial institutions in India as they sought to defend themselves from the increasing scale of DDoS attacks. I think it's worth noting that enterprise grade security is not just about scale and reach, which Akamai has plenty of. It's also about having the right people and expertise to partner with and support the most demanding enterprise accounts. And it's about having five nines of platform reliability. These are critical areas where Akamai excels. And there are key reasons why customers trust Akamai to keep them operating normally during even the most challenging circumstances. We've also continued to advance our security capabilities through innovation. For example, last month, we announced the availability of our new behavioral DDoS engine for Akamai's app and API protector solution. It leverages machine learning and intelligence from our global platform to analyze data from multiple sources to provide automated protection against application layer attacks. Turning now to compute. The strong momentum that we achieved in the first half of the year accelerated in Q3 with compute revenue growing to $167 million, up 28% year-over-year. We continued to add new compute customers at a strong pace and we remain on track for our new enterprise compute solutions to exit the year with an annualized revenue run rate of more than $100 million. In Q3, we saw enterprise compute wins in the US at one of the largest retailers, one of the world's largest SaaS platforms, a large e-gaming platform, a large sports gaming platform, a nationwide passenger railroad and a global weather forecaster. In Europe, we saw a large compute win with a major German travel platform. And a major telco doubled their prior commit for our enterprise compute solutions. In Latin America, one of the largest private banks in Brazil expanded their reliance on Akamai to adopt an ISV observability solution that provides insights into data to help improve user experience. And in APJ, we signed up an international domain management platform that enables domain owners to optimize and manage their domains using our compute solutions. Across the world, we're seeing strong interest in our differentiated cloud computing platform for cloud native apps, observability, better performance and lower cost. Retailers in particular have told us that they've achieved better performance and conversion rates for their mobile apps running on Akamai Connected Cloud, with one reporting $160,000 in additional revenue per day. We're also seeing more opportunities for our platform to support the use of AI for tasks such as image generation and processing, speech recognition, consumer analytics and prediction and generation of short videos for advertising. In September, we introduced new video workflow capabilities from our ISV partners that integrate our compute and delivery platforms to give media customers unprecedented flexibility to tailor media experiences to meet their user demands. And over the past year, we've greatly expanded our object storage capabilities to help customers get reliable, scalable and low latency workload performance at a fraction of the cost charged by hyperscalers. Customers have responded. For example, French premium television channel Canal+ expanded their use of our services last quarter, adding Akamai cloud computing and migrating their video assets to Akamai's object store. This enabled them to significantly reduce their costs while improving performance and reliability. And just this month, Akamai entered into a multiyear strategic partnership with a large video workflow ISV that includes a $17 million commitment for Akamai's enterprise compute services. In an evaluation of public cloud platforms released last quarter, Forrester named Akamai a strong performer and noted that Akamai offers, a market leading edge platform that provides businesses with a distributed platform to build, run and secure applications. The vision to lead as an [IAS] alternative by offering compute at the edge of networks for low latency workloads and strengths in edge development with a significant global fabric of edge locations and robust computing platform that developers can utilize to deploy applications closer to users. In summary, we're pleased with the momentum that we've achieved in compute this year and we're very excited about the enormous opportunity ahead. Now turning to delivery. As we've noted on recent calls, our delivery solutions have been weathering macroeconomic headwinds that have been felt industry wide. In the 25 years that we've been in the delivery business, we've seen numerous swings in traffic levels, such as when traffic slowed as the largest Internet companies adopted DIY a decade ago and as when traffic boomed at the start of the pandemic. Most recently, we've seen traffic growth slow as the streaming and gaming verticals have faced their own headwinds. Looking forward, we expect that traffic growth will eventually rebound just as it has in the past. Catalysts for potential future traffic growth include the analysis by Nielsen that 59% of video consumption has yet to move online, along with a lot of advertising, which will presumably follow the audience. More advanced video games and the growth of online sports, which is still in the early innings, are also catalysts to watch. When traffic growth picks up, we believe that Akamai is in a much stronger position than competitors to capture it. Given our scale and cost structure, we can add traffic very profitably, while it appears that many of our competitors are struggling to even stay in business. In the meantime, and as I've said before, our plan for delivery is threefold. First, we'll remain disciplined when it comes to the profitability of traffic that we choose to serve. Second, we'll continue to leverage our market leadership position and installed base of major enterprises to generate cross selling opportunities. And third, we'll continue to take steps to retain our market leadership while also reinvesting most of the cash flow from our delivery product line into the fast growing areas of the business. It's important to note that Akamai realizes strong synergies and competitive advantages by offering customers delivery in addition to security and compute. These synergies and advantages include improved performance and seamless integration, bundling for cross selling and strong customer retention, increased margins for all of our services, unmatched visibility from seeing enormous volumes of traffic and the capacity to quickly detect and stop massive cyber attacks at the edge. As you can see from our results, Akamai has come a long way in our evolution from the leading content delivery company into the cybersecurity and cloud computing company that powers and protects business online. We're very pleased to see our security business exceed $2 billion in annual revenue run rate and we're very excited about the enormous potential for future growth in cloud computing. But we still have more work to do to fully realize the potential of the fast growing areas of our business. As our next step, we plan to shift more investment into the development of our cloud computing capabilities and new security products, as well as into the go-to-market resources and partner ecosystem to sell these services to a broader portion of the enterprise marketplace. With the success of our new solutions in API security, enterprise security and cloud computing, we're now selling to enterprises who were not in the sweet spot for our delivery or cloud WAF services. And so we plan to add go-to-market positions for hunting as well as experienced specialists to support sales of the new products. Our new offerings are also much more partner friendly than our traditional delivery and cloud WAF solutions. And so we're also continuing to strengthen our partner ecosystem. In order to help fund these investments in the fast growing areas of the business, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate about 2.5% of the current roles across the company. This was a painful decision because it impacts our people whose innovation and drive have been an important part of our success. We believe that redeploying these resources will enable us to grow while still maintaining our near term operating margin target of about 30% and then be in a better position to climb above 30% as the fast growing areas of our business expand our profitability. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed, who will review the Q3 results in more detail and provide our outlook on Q4. Ed? Ed McGowan : Thank you, Tom. Today, I plan to review our Q3 results, provide some financial color on our restructuring charge and then discuss our expectations for Q4. I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue for the third quarter was $1.005 billion, up 4% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency, marking our first $1 billion quarter. Compute revenue was $167 million, up 28% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. These results included a $7 million onetime benefit related to the release of some deferred revenue in conjunction with the expiration of a long term legacy compute contract. As Tom mentioned, we continue to see very positive market momentum with our enterprise compute solutions and remain on track to exit the year with an annualized revenue run rate of more than $100 million. Moving to security revenue. In the third quarter, security revenue was $519 million, a 14% year-over-year increase as reported and in constant currency. During Q3, we had $3 million of 1 time license revenue compared to $6 million in Q3 of last year. During Q3, revenue from Noname was approximately $8 million in line with our expectations. It's worth noting that similar to Guardicore, our partner and channel ecosystem is the driving force behind the majority of new customer wins for our new API security solutions. Combined, compute and security revenue grew 17% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency, representing 68% of total revenue. Delivery revenue was $319 million, a 16% year-over-year decline, both as reported and in constant currency. Sequentially, delivery revenue decreased 3%, which is an improvement compared to the 6% and 10% sequential declines in the previous two quarters. As Tom mentioned, delivery has been impacted by recent macroeconomic headwinds that have been felt industry wide. As a result, we have seen a significant slowdown in year-over-year traffic growth, most notably in video streaming and gaming. While it's difficult to predict exactly when the industry will recover and growth will resume, we believe our business will be uniquely positioned to capitalize on the recovery. Our scale and cost structure enables us to attract and retain customers very profitably and our delivery business continues to generate very desirable cash flows. International revenue was $480 million, up 3% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency, representing 48% of total revenue in Q3. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $5 million on a sequential basis and a negative $3 million impact on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $244 million or $1.59 of earnings per diluted share, down 2% year-over-year and down 1% in constant currency. As a reminder, included in our Q3 results is a full quarter's worth of Noname's revenue and expense. And finally, our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 29%. Moving now to cash and our use of capital. As of September 30th, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2 billion. During the third quarter, we spent approximately $166 million, repurchasing approximately 1.7 million shares. We now have an aggregate of roughly $2.1 billion remaining in our share buyback authorizations. As it relates to the use of capital, our intentions remain the same : to continue buying back shares over time, to offset dilution from employee equity programs, and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases. Before I provide our Q4 guidance, I want to touch on some housekeeping items. First, as part of our new go-to-market approach and subsequent workforce realignment that Tom mentioned, we took an $82 million restructuring charge in Q3. This charge was primarily driven by our workforce reduction and related severance costs, along with the write down of intangible assets related to the Neosec acquisition. We estimate the workforce action will result in approximately $45 million of annualized savings going forward. We expect to reinvest most of those savings as part of the plan Tom discussed to refocus our go-to-market efforts around our fast growing compute and security offerings. Second, in previous years, seasonal factors significantly influenced our Q4 financial performance. This year, we are seeing weaker than normal traffic trends persisting into October. As a result, we do not anticipate an improvement in traffic growth for the remainder of 2024. Finally, Q4 operating expenses tend to be higher than Q3 due to increased sales commissions for reps who exceed their annual sales quotas. And this year, our annual employee merit cycle went into effect on October 1st. So with those factors in mind, I'll move to our Q4 guidance. We are projecting revenue in the range of $995 million to $1.020 billion, which is flat to up 3% as reported and in constant currency over Q4 of 2023. At current spot rates, including the significant volatility from yesterday, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $7 million impact on Q4 revenue compared to Q3 levels and a negative $5 million impact on a year-over-year basis. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 72% to 73%. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $321 million to $327 million. We expect Q4 EBITDA margin of approximately 40% to 41%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $131 million to $133 million. And we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27% to 28% for Q4. Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend $184 million to $192 million. This represents approximately 18% to 19% of our projected total revenue. The sequential increase in CapEx is primarily due to timing, as several projects were delayed from Q3 to Q4. Based on our expectations for revenue and costs, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.49 to $1.56. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $54 million to $57 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 153 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year. We now expect revenue of $3.966 billion to $3.991 billion, which is up 4% to 5% year-over-year as reported and up 5% in constant currency. At current spot rates, our guidance assumes foreign exchange will have a negative $22 million impact on revenue in 2024 on a year-over-year basis. We expect security growth of approximately 15% to 17% in constant currency in 2024. Given the continued adoption of our enterprise compute solution, we are now increasing our overall expected compute revenue growth to the higher end of our prior guidance or approximately 25% in constant currency for the full year 2024. Moving to profitability. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $6.31 to $6.38. Our non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 154 million shares. Finally, our full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 17% of total revenue. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our continued progress with our enterprise compute solutions and excited about the early returns for our recently introduced API solutions. Thank you. Tom and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Rishi Jaluria : Maybe, Tom, in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about some of the traction that you're having on the AI side, including with AI companies. Can you help us understand philosophically, how you're thinking about the role that GenAI could play in security on both sides of the equation, both from what happens? How you can leverage GenAI to make security offerings better but maybe more significantly, what does that do to attack surfaces and attack vectors, especially if GenAI is going to get in the hands of nefarious actors? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Tom Leighton : GenAI is already in the hands and being widely used by nefarious actors, and that's one reason why we're seeing a lot more attacks and penetrations. Probably, you've all seen the deepfakes very compelling but it's also used to generate the malware and train it to get around defenses. So it is increasing the need for defenses, defenses and depth. I think it's a big reason why you really need segmentation now and the Guardicore solution is doing so well. On our side of the house, we've been using AI and ML really forever in our security products. We use it for anomaly detection, bot detection. If it's a human logging into an account, making sure it's the right human and not somebody who stole credentials. We also use it to -- across the company really to be more efficient in the various operations we do. We're using it in -- already in two of our products, security products with GenAI as an interface. So it helps our customers manage their deployments of our security solution, gives them greater visibility. You can interface with your infrastructure and human language. Using our capabilities, you can ask what's that device there? Are the firewall rules up to date? You can ask questions like what do I need to do to bring my firewall rules within the last couple iterations so they're not too far out of date. And it answers and tells you. It's really very compelling and very interesting capabilities. So a lot of use of GenAI, I would say, at Akamai. Still early days. But unfortunately, the bad guys are using it too, very effectively. Rishi Jaluria : And then just quickly, Tom, you alluded to this in your prepared remarks, but obviously, seeing some higher profile shakeouts, including a long awaited bankruptcy of one of your long time competitors. Maybe help us understand both near term, long term, how we should be thinking about the impact on your business from consolidation? Maybe is there an opportunity for you to gain share of wallet, especially as the kind of stable player and leader in the space? And then longer term, with one less player that had been maybe aggressive on pricing, how do you think this shakes out in the overall pricing environment, specifically on the delivery side? Tom Leighton : Yes, I think consolidation in the delivery market is long overdue. And you've seen a lot of companies operating at losses in part funded by private equity or Wall Street. And it just didn't make sense. These companies were never going to make money. You still see some of it out there today with companies that are just really struggling, offering pricing which for them, loses money. And so I do think it makes sense to have some consolidation. And you're right, we've seen -- there was Instart Logic, StackPath, Lumen all gone. Edgio, which is the combination of EdgeCast and Limelight and Chapter 11, we'll see how that works out. But I do think this shake out makes sense. And I do think long run, it helps lead to a stabilization of the delivery market. As we talked about, we are very careful with our pricing. And we do turn away business that we don't think makes sense for us. And sometimes, other companies will step in and take that, they'll lose money in the hopes of showing some revenue growth. But I think it's not sustainable for them to do that. And I think the shakeout may be the beginning of something very positive and will help the delivery business over the medium to longer term. Operator : And the next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler. James Fish : You made a comment about shifting investments here on the go-to-market to investing behind hunters as well as sales specialists as well as the channel. Can you just talk about what caused you to make the shift now rather than at year end? How to think about the mix of that investment between the direct and specialists against kind of the indirect approach with the channel? Tom Leighton : I think we are really seeing good traction now. We already had traction, I would say, in Guardicore. But now with API security, we talked about achieving an ARR of $50 million at year end versus near zero last year. So we really, I think, proved that out and we're very excited about the future. And with compute, last year, we really weren't even selling enterprise compute. The platform just wasn't at that level. And this year, as we talked about, we are now beginning to sell it and seeing great traction to the point where we think that will be a $100 million ARR by the end of the year. So we've now, I think, proved it certainly to ourselves that this is worthy of more investment. Now at the same time, the new product areas are attracted to a much broader market of enterprises than our traditional leading products, which would be delivery and cloud WAF. And so there's a lot of enterprises and verticals that do use cloud computing, do need API security, do need enterprise security that works in the sweet spot for our traditional services. And so that says we do need to invest more in hunting now. We got to go after those accounts. And in addition, I think it's very helpful for us to have specialists, people that are really familiar with selling cloud computing and that will help our traction as we accelerate the growth there. So that's why we're doing it now and we didn't do it last year and why we're growing the resources there. And of course, these new products are also very channel friendly in ways that our traditional services weren't. Delivery in cloud WAF weren't just -- we had channel partners, but they weren't as friendly and as attractive. The new products, very attractive to the channel, and there's a real role for our channel partners to play. And of course with cloud computing, we've got a lot of ISVs now getting on the platform. So that's why we're making this investment now. James Fish : And maybe Ed, for you, as we think about the advanced security package changes that you guys made almost two years ago now. How penetrated is that across the security installed base, how much more room do we have to go with cross or upselling that unit? Trying to understand the year-to-date impact on security growth and anything as it pertains to the delivery impact as we think about those bundles. Ed McGowan : So we talked last quarter a lot about this as we had anniversaried the introduction of the package and had a pretty high penetration, obviously, especially with the -- early on with the early adopters of it. We're sort of the end of that at this point. So the way to think about it is you've got year-over-year compares that have us selling in both quarters. Operator : And our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Frank Louthan : Since you acquired the Lumen CDN last year, you're a little over a year ago, did you get any network elements with that? And is there any aspect of their new networks that they're building to support their AI partners that they're having conversations with you about, about implementing your capabilities and layering them on top of that network to help maybe deliver some of that AI traffic? Ed McGowan : So with the Lumen acquisition, there was no acquisition of any assets aside from the customer contracts. So there was no network acquisitions. And as far as any partnership discussions we have with Lumen, we're not prepared to talk about anything but there's nothing specific to what you mentioned there. Operator : The next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citigroup. Unidentified Analyst : This is Mark on for Fatima. Maybe just -- great to hear the momentum that you guys are seeing on compute, but maybe just on profitability. Why aren't we seeing maybe greater evidence of operating leverage given the compute outperformance, especially since the segment commands better relative gross profit characteristics to delivery, which is declining? Ed McGowan : So we're still in the scaling up factor within the compute business, so we haven't reached scale yet. And you're right to think that once we get to a much larger scale, we should start to see better flow through. You'll see, hopefully, gross margins expand a little bit and operating margin expand. But we're still in the investment phase of the business and haven't reached scale yet. Unidentified Analyst : And maybe just a quick follow-on. How should we think about CapEx trajectory going through '25 from sort of the '24 70% level going forward? Ed McGowan : So we're not going to provide guidance on this call for next year. But as we talked about -- last year was a pretty heavy investment year for CapEx related to building out some of the major data centers for compute. We don't anticipate anything like that going forward. But what I've said in the past is if we do see unusually large deals that come with more revenue, there may be some additional builds. But as we've talked about this CapEx level somewhere in this range is generally where we'd like to keep the business for now. Obviously, as compute gets bigger, that may change over time. But certainly, over the next couple of years, that's about the range we'd like to stay in. Operator : And our next question is from Rudy Kessinger with D.A. Davidson. Rudy Kessinger : Ed, I want to ask on delivery. It's basically implied in Q4 that delivery revenue is down 20%, 21% year-over-year by my math. I guess, it seems kind of hard to wrap my head around that if traffic is still growing. I know you're saying traffic growth is not as strong as you've seen in the past. But if traffic growth is still growing, just help us try to understand how delivery could be down over 20% year-over-year unless you're seeing much higher pricing pressure than you've seen in the past? And then as we think about going forward, maybe '25 is it fair to assume that delivery is at least a double digit decline going forward? Ed McGowan : So a couple of things to think about here. So if you remember, last Q4 we had the Lumen and StackPath acquisitions. And during that time, when it entered into the transition services agreement, we had all of the contracts even though we had anticipated some of those would go away. So it's a really difficult compare, Q4. And in terms of traffic growth, it is growing very slowly. So at rates that we haven't seen in the 25 plus years we've been in this business, so it's growing very, very slow. Pricing is getting a little bit better. But even if you have 5%, 10% price declines and your traffic is growing in low single digits, you're not going to see growth, you're going to see contraction. So it's just been a weak traffic environment. Pricing, as I said, is getting a little bit better. But it takes a lot longer for that to work its way through the system and we get a tough compare. So those are the factors. Rudy Kessinger : And then on compute, maybe it's a around in you CapEx. It looks like maybe at the midpoint, if you use the percent you're giving for the full year, up about $40 million for this year. Correct me if my math is wrong there. But if it is accurate, it seems like a little bit of a step up with not much of a raise in the compute guide for this year if I back out the $7 million in onetime that you had for Q3? Ed McGowan : Yes, it's about that, maybe just a little bit less shade less than that. But it's a combination of a bunch of things. It's not all compute. There's some compute in there. There's some related to delivery in terms of some of the places where we have outsized demand. So unfortunately, delivery demand isn't all in one place. It's not just one number, you have to build out in certain geos as you get demand in certain places. And there's also infrastructure services, infrastructure that we use to run the platform. And there's always some timing between quarters so a little bit slipped out of Q3 and a little bit came in from Q1. So I wouldn't read too much into it. Operator : And the next question is from Matt Dezort with Needham. Matt Dezort : I guess within compute, could you touch on some of the early use cases and verticals and how those are performing? Any cohort metrics you can offer, especially behind some of the observability in security and media customers you guys have talked about? And any other newer tips that you guys are seeing as driving more workloads to Connected Cloud? Tom Leighton : Yes, I would say the sweet spot early on by design in terms of revenue is media workflow but we are seeing compute sales across really all verticals and including new customers. And just to give you an idea of the range of our ISV partners who -- customers will buy solutions from them or from us on our platform. There's a couple of database partners, observability widely being sold, live encoding, transcoding, video packaging, WebRTC for interactive video, digital asset management, optimization of video, game orchestration, fleet management, DRM, Kubernetes, connectivity and auto scaling, server side ad insertion, AI inferencing and API performance and testing. And that's just the list of different ISV partners. So we really are seeing a lot of use cases across multiple verticals with a sweet spot in media workflow. And at this point, we really have a very good ecosystem media workflow partners, which is starting, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, really being well received in terms of our media customer base. They're looking for better performance, distributed compute at a lower price point and we're really in a good position to provide that today. Matt Dezort : And as a quick follow-up. Can I ask about some of the security pieces excluding Guardicore and Noname? How did some of the larger pieces perform in 3Q across WAF? It sounds like DDoS was really strong, you touched on a number of wins there. Did that drive any incremental upside in the quarter? And how do you think about that triumvirate going forward? Ed McGowan : So we saw pretty good strength across all different products, including -- you talked about Guardicore but even within the Zero Trust space, with our Enterprise Access product, we saw some pretty good growth there. We saw continued strong growth in WAF. We saw some acceleration in DDoS. You don't really get a big burst of revenue right away when you have attacks in a quarter. Typically, you sign up new customers and that revenue comes out over time. But it was pretty strong demand, pretty similar to what we saw in Q2 across the board. Operator : And the next question comes from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Erdi Wu] on for Mark Murphy. I wanted to ask a question on compute as well. It's really good to see that momentum. I think you guys specifically called out adding customers at a strong rate and now kind of getting customers outside that sweet spot, which is very interesting to hear. So I guess my question is, is that kind of rate of addition of those customers a little bit more than you expected? And are you seeing these kind of non-sweet spot customers kind of come in earlier than you expected as well? Tom Leighton : We're very encouraged with the adoption of our compute services, substantial increase in number of customers. And even though we planned and focused early on on the big media accounts that are already Akamai customers for using our platform, we're really seeing it across the base and a lot of new customers signing up, starting with compute that didn't use our pre-existing services. So we're very pleased to see the growth in compute. And of course, you've seen all year long as we've raised our targets for the year in terms of the enterprise compute revenue and the compute business as a whole. Operator : And this does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mark Stoutenberg for any closing remarks. Mark Stoutenberg : Thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be attending several investor conferences throughout the rest of the quarter. We look forward to seeing you there. Again, thanks for joining us tonight. We hope you have a nice evening. Operator, you may now end the call. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",
