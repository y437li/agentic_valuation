It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino : Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to our conference call. Coming off a record year in 2013, we are continuing this momentum, with first quarter revenue growth of 22%, AOI growth of 56% and free cash flow, up 138%. And all four divisions delivered revenue and AOI growth for the quarter. As we look forward, all signs point to us delivering on our growth targets for 2014. In concerts, our deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was up 14%, and ticket sales through May 2nd are up 5% year-on-year. In Sponsorship and Advertising, our contracted revenue through April was up 10% over last year, and in ticketing, our net renewal rate continues at over 100%, and at Artist Nation, we are on track to grow market share and come up 30% more shows in 2014. I will now provide you with update on our core growth strategies. We expect to continue growing our global market share this year. Following our success of adding 10 million fans in 2013 concerts. Our research shows, continued strong fan demand for all live events on a global basis, with a continued strong pipeline of great artists. We expect the Live Events business to continue being a robust growth industry, and having the two leading brands of Live Nation and Ticketmaster position us strongly in the center of this growth. And as we head into this summer, the business looks strong again, as evidenced by selling 500,000 tickets in three days last week for the Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 tour alone. And we will continue to grow market share three ways. First, we will continue growing our share in touring from clubs to stadiums. We expect to promote over 80% of the top 25 tours globally this year. Secondly, we will continue to grow our festival portfolio, with 5 million fans across 63 festivals, Live Nation is the largest festival producer in the world, and we expect to grow this fan base by 10% this year. Our portfolio of 18 electronic festivals continues to be quite strong, led by Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, which is the largest electronic festival in the world, with over 400,000 tickets sold for a three day festival. And third, we will continue our market expansion and enter new markets. Collectively, our global concert platform has never been stronger, as we will promote over 23,000 shows in 40 countries, with 3,000 artists in 2014, and we continue to add more markets, festivals and shows to this platform. Our artist management business is becoming increasingly strategic to our pipeline of the concert business. This division now, in 2014, will promote over 30% more shows than they did in last year. So we are continuing to see this division as a feeding to our main concert division, which ultimately drives our on-site sponsorship and ticketing business. Our artist management division is a global leader, managing over 250 artists, and we expect to continue adding to this portfolio, as it supports our core business. The third driver of our business is the rapid growth of our sponsorship advertising and digital business. Our advertising business continues to grow rapidly, the 13% increase in ad units sold during the first quarter, as we increase total traffic to our platform by 14%. This growth was driven by large commitments from major brands like [indiscernible] Ford and O2, and from our digital platform growth. We continue to offer unique proposition for advertisers, who want to engage with fans at scale on digital and on-site. In last week, we took a major step forward in transforming our advertising business towards a true media and content company, with the announcement of our Live Nation channel on Yahoo! While others have streamed shows in the past, only Live Nation, with the scale of 23,000 shows globally, can consistently deliver programming and establish a network with an ongoing advertising base. With this channel, we company-sell the advertising. So our advertising team has new ad units to sell, and we are attracting large commitments, that will drive advertising revenue from day one from this channel. I expect that our venture with Yahoo! proves successful. You will see us further leverage our content in Live Nation brand accelerating the growth of our advertising business. And in Ticketmaster, our focus continues to be global growth, in developing new features and products to gain share and conversion. Top of our list for 2014 continues to be our integrated inventory product, Ticketmaster Resale. In a recent survey, over 90% of fans indicated they would find it valuable to see all of their ticket options in one location. A service we are uniquely positioned to provide, and now do. With 60 teams from the NFL, NBA and NHL and over 2,000 concerts now officially offering fans all verified options at Ticketmaster, we continue to see rapid adoption of both content and fans. Looking at our most recent results for the month of April, we grew our global resale volume at 40% relative to April 2013, and we are tracking towards what we expect to be $1 billion in resale GTV from the launch last September through this year. Growing market share, while we invest and evolve the Ticketmaster platform and product remains on plan. We are building this new platform in a modular fashion, and expect several key products to be deployed this year. For consumers, the new platform is powering the Ticketmaster Resale product, as well as other features on mobile, that will enhance search, purchase and checkout. And we will also deploy new products for our venue clients, with additional analytics and marketing products in 2014. I remain confident that the investment to date has been key to delivering Ticketmaster's renewal, as well as providing a foundation for new products and features, that continue growing Ticketmaster's global business; with Ticketmaster Resale being the first proof-of-concept. We will continue to see operating reductions that we need to deliver our strategic plans. These cost reductions will start to have a meaningful impact in 2014, and will be important contributors to Ticketmaster's profitability this year. Given our momentum coming out of 2013, our strong early success with Q1 and solid leading indicators, I am confident in 2014, we will deliver our fourth consecutive year of revenue, AOI and free cash flow growth. Grow the profitability of each our businesses; stay on track to deliver on 2015 financial targets; operationally continue to invest and build all of our businesses, to set them up for continued growth. I will now turn the call over to Joe Berchtold, our COO, to take you through an update on the divisions. Joe Berchtold : Thanks Michael. First, Concerts; Live Nation Concerts revenue for the first quarter was up 29%, and AOI improved by 80% versus 2013, driven by an 11% increase in global attendance at our shows. In North America, attendance was up 30%, with a 34% increase in arena attendance, led by tours with Justin Timberlake, Imagine Dragons and Luke Bryan. Internationally, attendance was up 8%, driven by an 18% increase in arena attendance. Europe, particularly France and the U.K., led this growth with tours, with Depeche Mode, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Beyonc\u00e9 and Drake. Through May 2nd, global ticket sales for all shows are up 5% through the same time in 2013, and the global growth has been across all venue types, with nine artists already selling over 500,000 tickets for the year, led by One Direction, Justin Timberlake, Luke Bryan and Miley Cyrus. Through April, we sold approximately half our tickets for the year, and based on sales to-date in our pipeline, we expect to deliver continued attendance growth for the full year. We expect that this growth, along with improved performance in our festival business, will deliver strong growth in our 2014 concerts profitability. One other point to note on concerts is the seasonality of the business this year, with a significant shift from Q2 into both Q1 and Q3. As I mentioned, arena attendance was the primary driver of our growth in Q1, thanks to a 10% increase in arena show count. In Q3, we expect to see strong growth in both festivals and stadium attendance, with all growth in festival attendance projected for the third quarter, and stadium attendance projected to increase by over 50% for the quarter. As a result, Q2 will be impacted by the shift out of arena activity into Q1 and festival and stadium activity into Q3. On Artist Nation, for the quarter, revenue was up 44% and our AOI was $5 million compared to a loss of $1 million last year, driven by the artist management business. In 2014, we expect improved AOI from the artist management, Artist Nation division, from a growing roster of artists under management. Turning to our Sponsorship and Advertising business; for the first quarter, revenue for the division was up 13%, with sponsorship sales up 13% and online revenue up 12%. AOI was up 8%, and AOI growth was slightly lower than revenue for the quarter because of headcount increases, particularly for online advertising, where we have added staff in anticipation of building our online content. We expect this additional headcount to deliver strong growth in online advertising in the second half of the year, as we expand our programming with Yahoo!, launched additional content verticals, and build on our current Live Nation and Ticketmaster sites. Similarly, we expect festival sponsorship to continue growing rapidly, and for the full year, to increase by over 15%. At this point, we have sold approximately 75% of our expected sponsorship for the revenue for the year, and half of our planned online advertising sales. This puts us on plan to deliver our expected growth for the year. Finally, Ticketmaster; for the quarter, ticketing revenue increased 9%; AOI was up 17%, with primary ticket sales up 3% for the quarter, and growth transaction value of the primary tickets up 9%. The concert segment was the primary driver of our ticket growth, both in tickets sold and for the increased gross transaction value, given the pricing on concert tickets is generally higher than average ticket pricing. Geographically, our markets were fairly consistent with North America volume up 2% and gross transaction value up 8%, while international volume was up 3% and gross transaction value up 10%. On mobile, we continue to see a rapid shift of consumer behavior, now accounting for 16% of all tickets sold in the first quarter, up 33% from the same period last year. In North America, ticket sales grew by 26% and accounted for 18% of overall ticket sales, while in Europe, they grew by 69% and accounted for 13% of overall ticket sales. Based on the ticket sales in the first quarter and projections for the full year, we are currently expecting low single digit growth in ticket sales for the year, with AOI growth slightly higher than ticket growth. Overall, given the strength of our first quarter performance and more importantly, our visibility into the rest of the year, we believe we will again grow our businesses in 2014, and continue on track to deliver our three year plan in 2015. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Kathy Willard, to take you through more details on our financials. Kathy Willard : Thanks Joe and good afternoon everyone. We had a strong start to fiscal 2014, with growth across all of our operating segments. I will provide further details on the first quarter results, and then summarize our current expectations for the full year. For the first quarter, revenue was $1.1 billion, up 22% over the same period last year. This increase was led by concerts, which improved by 29% compared to the prior year, from an increase in arena shows globally, and higher overall attendance. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter grew 56% to $83 million as compared to $53 million in 2013, and this growth was led by our concerts and ticketing segments. Concerts AOI improved 80% to a loss of $2.6 million, due to higher overall attendance, along with increased average attendance per show. Specifically to arenas in North America and Europe. Ticketing AOI was up 17% to $70 million, due to increased ticket volume and higher average pricing. Sponsorship and Advertising AOI was up 8% to $26 million, with growth in both North America and Europe; and Artist nation AOI was up $6 million from the management business. The improved performance in our AOI drove a 63% improvement in our operating income for this first quarter, as we reported an operating loss of $12 million, compared to a loss of $33 million last year. And the growth in our AOI, translated to the bottom line, as our net loss for the quarter, improved by $31 million over 2013, to a loss of $32 million. The improvement in the net loss was driven by our higher operating income in the first quarter, lower interest expense, due to the refinancing of our debt in Q3 of last year, and a discrete one time tax benefit of $7 million, related to deferred tax liabilities recorded from an acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2014. Cash flow also expanded with our AOI growth. Free cash flow was $34 million in the first quarter, compared to $14 million last year, with the improvement driven by our higher AOI, with some timing impacts on interest payments in the first quarter of this year. And cash flow from operations was $366 million for the year-to-date, up $95 million over 2013. This improvement is due to the increase in AOI, higher deferred revenue from ticket sales for future events, and timing of artist deposits, which were lower in the first quarter of 2014 compared to last year. As of March 31, we had total cash of $1.6 billion, which includes $569 million in ticketing client cash and $697 million in net concert event related cash. Our free cash was $363 million. Total event related deferred revenue was $885 million as of March 2014, as compared to $774 million in March last year. Due to an overall increase in ticket sales for 2014 events, which are up 10% as compared to March 2013. This deferred revenue in concert ticket sales to-date, give us confidence, that this will be a strong concert season. Our total capital expenditures for the first quarter were $21 million. We spent approximately $11 million on maintenance capital expenditures and $10 million on revenue generating addition. We currently continue to expect that our total capital expenditures for 2014, will be app $130 million for the full year, with under half of that spend on revenue generating projects. As of March 31, our total current and long term debt, including capital leases was $1.8 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding debt discount and including debt premiums, is 4.3%. Our debt covenant currently requires a maximum leverage ratio of 5.25 times, and we are comfortably in compliance of less than 3.5 times. We delivered strong results for the first quarter of 2014. Looking forward, we expect to drive growth across each of our businesses, and increase overall profitability, while continuing to invest in our long term growth strategies. We expect the positive trend this quarter to continue throughout 2014, and we currently expect to deliver solid growth in concert AOI. As Joe mentioned, we had an increase in early arena shows, shifting event activity on a comparable basis from the second quarter to the first. Additionally, we currently expect to have higher stadium activity in the third quarter, which will shift more activity out of Q2. The growth trend in sponsorship and advertising AOI is expected to continue in 2014 at historical rates. We expect ticketings AOI to be slightly up compared to 2013, as we grow our secondary ticket sales and deliver cost savings. We expect Artist Nation to grow its profitability this year as well. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Amy Yong with Macquarie Capital. Andrew DeGasperi : Yes hi, this is Andrew for Amy. I just had two questions, the first one, if maybe you can quantify the synergies that you expect from the replatforming of Ticketmaster this year? And also, can you comment on StubHub's recent initiatives, including the all-in pricing and concert series with Pandora? Thanks. Michael Rapino : On the first, with regards to not so much synergies, but the cost savings as we continue our replatforming, as we have talked several times now. The replatforming project is really an ongoing one that we have broken into a modular basis, so we can start both getting the consumer and venue benefits through new products as well as taking some costs out. So I would say, that our expectations at this point for this year is about a 10% -- sorry a $0.10 per ticket reduction in our costs for our fee-bearing tickets in North America. Andrew DeGasperi : Great. And the second one? Michael Rapino : On the -- I don't have a ton of input on what they are up to, and their strategy. But all-in pricing, we have had all-in pricing available to our clients for the last couple of years, depending on the artists, the team, they want to put all in pricing at the front of the proposition. We do that, we leave it in the hands of the client, while at times, it is -- the position is all in, but we break out the pieces to make it transparent. So we don't think all in pricing, either way, changes much on the purchase intent, but we have it as an option for the clients, if they want to position it that way. But we don't think it does much either way. I don't know what they are up to on their Pandora concert series, I assume they are just looking for some brand extension, but we are very thrilled with the progress we are making on our secondary market share. Andrew DeGasperi : Great. Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee. Vasily Karasyov : Hi, thank you. I was wondering if you could clarify the metric that you provided, that you have a 40% increase in secondary market, total value I believe. When you disclosed at the Analyst Day, I think last year, that you estimate that you have 10% of secondary tickets. Was that true for April last year, or was your share less than 10% at that point? Joe Berchtold : I think when we talked about the 10% share that we were looking at the year in its entirety, as you can tell from the numbers that Michael gave, we have been substantially growing our activity each month, since we have been launching our Ticketmaster Resale last fall; because of the seasonality difference, sports league on at different times, we wanted to give that April-to-April comparison, so that you have an understanding of versus April of last year, before we launched Ticketmaster retail to April of this year, the most recent full month that it has been going, that we increased our global secondary growth transaction value 40% year-over-year. Vasily Karasyov : And do you expect to provide this update every quarter, or do you think its going to be a one-off kind of illustration? Michael Rapino : I mean, we will try to provide the information we think is most relevant. So that you all and our investors can take a read on the progress that we are making. Vasily Karasyov : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Doug Arthur with Evercore. Doug Arthur : Joe, I want to go back to -- you're giving guidance sort of low single digit concert ticket sales for the year, based on your read right now, and then you made a comment about AOI for the year of somewhat better. Were you referring -- then you were talking about a dramatic, significant increase in concert profitability. So is the somewhat better AOI description for the entire company, I just want your clarity on that? Joe Berchtold : I think we had said on concerts, that we would have a strong increase in concerts division AOI, off of the continued fan growth that we have this year. We obviously, just from our current profitability of our concerts division, will tend to increase AOI to a higher percentage than our fan base. I think the overall message that we were trying to give on a totality, is that we continue on plan with what we have been consistently laying out, and we think that we are off to a very strong start, that gives us some good tailwind to deliver those results this year. And -- indicator to support that. Doug Arthur : And so, the first quarter, which is obviously seasonally small, you're up 56% in AOI. I guess the commentary strongly suggests that you're going to give some of that, if not a fair amount of that back in Q2 and then, kind of recapture on that in Q3. I am just trying to get a read here of kind of --? Joe Berchtold : I think that's roughly right. As you said, Q1 is seasonally low, when you look at the overall level of activity for concerts, just relative to the overall year. But I think in general, you got it right. We had a really strong Q1. We have a really strong Q3, and what we have seen just from a show-count perspective is, I gave the detail on, just seasonally less. Nothing more, nothing less than that, just timing. Doug Arthur : Okay. And then finally, on Artist Nation, I mean, this is -- you have been in a year long, kind of reshaping of that business, revenues were up 2% in 2012. They were down 12% in 2013. So now we are looking at a big pop in the first quarter. I know, a lot of that can't be timing associated with the concert tours. But are we having -- is this kind of a completely new platform at this point, and should we expect strong revenue growth for the year, or is that not the read? Michael Rapino : I think what we are trying to be very clear about is, Artist Nation on itself is the division of 15 or 16 management companies, that manage over 250 artists. We spent the year taking out a lot of services and non-core businesses that weren't core to the artist management business; VIP business, merchandise business, graphic artists, things that were in that division that we didn't believe could grow within there. So we took those out, and we have a very strong single minded Artist Nation division, that it wakes up every day, managing great artists, and furthering their careers. What we did say is, we don't believe that division has high growth in it organically. We believe that we are going to run it better, and we are going to add a few artists and continue to change up the portfolio and add some artists that we think have a long term perspective. But the most important thing was that division is kind of over the last year, when the silos got broken down. We were able to embrace that division to a level we hadn't heard historically. And that division's main goal is, with 250 artists, you can now capture and co-op into touring with you, supporting your ticketing proposition and supporting your sponsorship division. There is nothing better than 250 fabulous artists feeding your main pipeline. And that is the structural change that has happened, is that division now reporting directly to me, is much more integrated in our sponsorship, our ticketing and our concert division. So we believe, having 250 strong artists, as a high margin business, generates nice AOI, is a stable and strong business on itself, but more importantly, the numbers we keep telling you, but over the last two years, since we have kind of taken it over, we have doubled the amount of shows that those 250 artists do, that are now touring with Live Nation versus our competitors. So we believe, its an incredible, strong division on its own, but when linked to our core business, can drive profitability in our core concert business on its own, and then ticketing and sponsorship. So if you took last year's number and we were up 25%, we are going to be up 30%. If those 250 artists combined have a few thousand concerts, and now we have gone from promoting 300 of them to 600 of them, that's a great supply chain; and we believe that if we add value to that division, we will continue to gather more concert market share from that division, if we have the best product out there. And that, in itself, even in the core business, you don't see reflected in the Artist Nation financials, but you do obviously see it reflected in our increased market share in our concert division. Doug Arthur : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from David Joyce with International Strategy and Investment Group. David Joyce : Thank you very much. Your attendance per event was up again nicely, both North America and internationally. How much would you attribute that to the Ticketmaster replatforming and increased conversion, and how much would you be attributing that to macroeconomic trends or other factors? Joe Berchtold : I think a couple of factors David. Clearly we believe, that as we continue to develop new products at Ticketmaster, online, the Ticketmaster plus the mobile; we are continuing to give more kind of a better experience for consumers and a better experience that makes the purchase easier. It is always going to help conversion some, is one. Two is, we continue to be very focused on shifting more of our marketing spend to digital and social platforms, using that database that we have on fan interest, fan behavior, historical purchase patterns, what they have on their iPhones, to do a better job, making them aware, getting them interested in the show. And then, third would be, kind of, what's the mix of artists that you have in some of the macro environment. David Joyce : Thanks. And on the type of events, that are growing for you. The festivals, the summer, for example, is that an area where the growth in sponsorship advertising revenue might be more focused, given that you've talked about that being an area where there is more [indiscernible] upside? Michael Rapino : Yes, absolutely. We have always been very strong in Europe with our festival platform. Our festival platform has been our main driver to our advertising business in Europe, and as we are adding more and more festivals in America and Canada and Australia, we know that our advertising proposition gets stronger, and we have seen that already come to life, with our Insomniac acquisition for some of our new countries festivals, or Made in America with Jay-Z festivals are a great platform for advertisers, and we will continue to build up that portfolio. David Joyce : Thanks. And just finally on the Artist Nation strength, with the increase in commissions there, was that related to the artists performing or at arenas or was it more clubs, how would you characterize where the growth opportunities have been coming there? Joe Berchtold : Part of it is timing for us, with the activity. But in general, its just where our artists, the managers are -- where those artists are active in a particular quarter, there is nothing magical about it. Michael Rapino : And just on the economics of that, as we have said many times, the artist is making most of its money on the road. So if my business in general, on a global basis is continuing to grow and Maroon 5s and Rihannas have more and more opportunities to tour, make more money, then the largest part of your commission is going to be your touring business. So a manager going forward is going to have an increased business, just off the basics that his artist is a good touring artist, the tour -- the artist is going to have more revenue and more growth in the future. David Joyce : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Rich Tullo with Albert Fried & Company. Rich Tullo : Hey guys. Got one question; in regards to seasonality, it looks like you ran about 5% ahead of my model on first quarter attendance. Looking at seasonality as a percentage of total revenue for the year, I guess this is for Kathy. When you talk about the second quarter, are we talking at something like 100 to 200 basis points was transferred into the first quarter and something like 100 basis points will be transferred into the third quarter? Joe Berchtold : This is Joe, I don't think we are getting that specific. I think what we said is, we had a strong first quarter that we were very happy with. All the leading indicators that we have locked through [ph], point to continued strength through the rest of the year, and we are just trying to, every year, round this time we have a conversation that says, what does the seasonality look like, because we manage it for the total year, not for the given quarters. And this year, its particularly strong in the third quarter, as I talked about festivals and stadiums. Strong in the first quarter, and so by definition, some of that has to come out in the second quarter. But in totality, everything pointing to ongoing growth and strength. Rich Tullo : Yeah, there is a question about that -- Joe Berchtold : Now -- Michael Rapino : We know we are trying to fill out, we got it. We are trying to help you, but we are just going to not -- we'd only get caught exactly on 100 shows versus this month versus next, in an overall thesis right now. Rich Tullo : All right. Okay. I am not asking you to point the wrong finger here, but to point the finger on the EDM, are you thinking about festivals, in terms of more of an experiential marketing, and an advertising plan, versus just kind of a sponsorship and pouring rights. I mean, is that where we are headed with this, and if that's the case, is that going to be kind of an announcement data point, or you are just going to let the numbers surprise, if this transpires? Michael Rapino : Not even quite sure what you're asking, but I could try to answer what I think you are asking. But help me out here, what are you asking about EDM exactly? Rich Tullo : Well I mean, it just seems to me that the opportunity with sponsorships is more than just banners and pouring rights, right? The opportunity is to develop a one-to-one communication between the concert grower and the advertiser, in ways that is not necessarily available in a two-hour venue? Michael Rapino : Absolutely. I think if you look at our business, its what we have been doing for many years. I mean, our business model, whether its an EDM festival or country festival, stadium show or a house of blues, our main job is to create that 23,000 show flywheel that spits out 60 million to 70 million consumers on-site. And from that scale of consumer base, we built 800 plus sponsors, and many of those sponsors are much deeper than a banner ad as you know. They are very integrated programs like the Ford Rider series, which is a whole content program, online series we created for Ford to the American Express front of the line, through the Starwood upgrade, while you purchase a ticket to stay at a Starwood hotel, through upselling a Hertz rental car. So we have got an incredible sponsor base, who want to participate in many of the different genres, and you know, the beautiful part of what our model is, is diversity. A 19 year old or 30 year old or a 40 year old, doesn't live in one genre. Most 19 year olds love Taylor Swift, when they are feeling love sick and they want to party with the latest EDM artist, and they head over to a Rihanna show for pop. So our basics is, when we talk to sponsors, its about the scale of the 19-year old we have, and the amount we can touch, incredible sponsorship programs for 800 sponsors, and then the way we are going to touch and communicate to those customers, is why we always believe in our Ticketmaster strategy, is we have 400 million consumers buying an average of $163 ticket directly for us. We know their name, we have their credit card, we have a communication platform with them. We have now on-site apps at Live Nation and Ticketmaster that are doing more and more for you on-site, and you can see in the future, the value we can bring to the Live Nation Ticketmaster app, whether its upgrading your seat when you are at the venue, whether its buying T-shirts cashless, ordering drinks. So we have already got the scale. We have got the LN and Ticketmaster brands and mobile applications that are talking directly to you ongoing. We have 800 powerful sponsors, who want to participate in that. So we are not obsessed with any specific genre around creating a one-on-one. We are very obsessed with having massive scale, that lets us talk to a lot of consumers about a lot of shows. Now within those brands, House of Blues, Insomniac, lot of our European festivals, they all have their own apps, their own websites and their own customer bases, that they do a great job on a one-to-one basis, talking directly to them, that's kind of a sub-brand. So we have a lot of sub-brands, but we have the scale of the master brands, that really is how we have unlocked the 800 sponsors, and are unlocking our 400 million plus database. Rich Tullo : One quick little question. It might not be an easy question to answer, but what percentage of the growth we have been seeing over the last, let's call it 18 months, has been from social marketing, which are doing evidently very well. Deals like Yahoo!, if you could provide a little color on that, and what percentage is coming from the expansion of the big data from Ticketmaster. I mean, can you quantify it or qualify it inn any way? Michael Rapino : We are not breaking that data out specific, it\u2019s a lot of our secret sauce; because no one else in the industry would have the breadth of resources and data that we have. But we have said it out loud over the last couple of years that we believe the greatest opportunity we have, is 23,000 shows and a Ticketmaster, well over 100,000 events on sale, the greatest opportunity we have to grow this business, is to sell 10 more tickets to each event. You sell an extra 10, 20, 30 tickets to -- our 20,000 shows or Ticketmaster's 100,000 plus shows, those are millions of dollars to the bottom line, incremental high margin. And we believe the route to get there, was always the unsophisticated industry becoming more sophisticated with the way it markets and talks to its customers. So taking the three year ago historic unsophisticated industry that spend all their money on print and radio and [indiscernible] shotgun, to this year, we are tracking well over 40% of our marketing spend is now -- lets call it one to one digital, advertising directly to those 90 million Rihanna fans, when you have a Rihanna concert. Talking to them directly through our database, and finding like minded Rihanna facts and activating them. You look three years ago, we sent a billion emails a year, with basically the same campaign, and in 2013, we sent over 1.5 billion emails, and we had over 900 campaigns, customized to different customers to different targets with different offers. And most of those are ending up in a young kid's mobile phone, with some rich video or visuals, and the open rate of conversion is incredibly encouraging. So we do believe that yes, a lot of it is just us, using our data, our customer research and converting our marketing spend to be much more efficient and try to find those 10 or 15 casual fans, that are thinking to go to a Rihanna, but we weren't hitting them with a billboard on sunset, we are hitting with a very direct marketing campaign, and we have got tons of engineers working on algorithms, to figure out how to keep finding a casual and non-buying Rihanna fan, and get her to the next show. And we think the data will be the sweet spot and the unique differentiator on how we bring more and more fans to those current shows. Rich Tullo : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from John Tinker with Maxim. John Tinker : Thanks. Terrific quarter. Congratulations. Could you just clarify a little more, how your deal with Yahoo! is going to work? Are you going to own the content that's streamed, or do the artists own that? Michael Rapino : Sure. Thanks John for asking. We are wildly excited. We spent the last couple of years, talking to a lot of different distributors, the obvious ones on, could we repackage some of our content, and not just provide it as a production fee, to help someone else's platform. But could we partake in the branding and the advertising. Kathy and Melissa saw the vision. The deal is in the simplest context, is they have agreed to underwrite the cost to deliver the content and shoot it. Obviously, we have already invested in the show, so we have done our part. We will then co-sell the advertising units, and we will show that on a 50-50 basis, once Yahoo! has recovered its cost basis. We are very encouraged, because we are highly subscribed already, talking to advertisers before we launched it. That's why we you saw me referencing my script, that we will -- this will be a positive revenue channel, almost A-1, and we get our Live Nation branding, which is very important to continue to show 800 sponsors and others, that we have the potential to take these 23,000 shows behind the scenes, on the stage and etcetera, to bundle up some great content. The deal is with Yahoo! The content is owned by both of us for the first, kind of broadcast of it, and then we will revert the rights back to the artist after a certain time period. So part of the value to the artist and keeping kind of the cost upfront low, is let us shoot your show. We don't plan on paying you. We are going to bring incredible audience to your show. We are going to shoot it quality, and we are going to let you reuse that content, when that was done. John Tinker : Great. Thank you. Michael Rapino : Thank you, John. Operator : And we will take our final question from Doug Arthur with Evercore. Doug Arthur : Yes. Joe, I just want to go back to you, some of your nuance comment on the third quarter. The -- Joe Berchtold : Hey Doug. Doug Arthur : Well the thing is, in the first quarter, the number of shows, the attendee per show were all sort of kind of on-trend. The big delta was the revenue per attendee was up 16%, it has been trending down year-over-year for the last few quarters. So obviously the arena, you have mentioned newer size of the arena impact in the first quarter. Is it -- the revenue per attendee, obviously, its hard to calculate a couple of quarters out? But I mean, is that something that could be based on the skew of shows you're seeing right now for Q3, and obviously at the festivals, etcetera. Could that be a positive surprise in the third quarter or is it too early to tell, get that refined on the mix? Joe Berchtold : So a couple of things. First of all, the first quarter as you said, there is obviously some mix in there; and the first quarter what you have, is really indoor, so you're seeing arenas, and theaters and clubs. But if you skew towards arenas, you will see just from that mix issue, some increased attendants per show and increased revenue per attendee, generally those ticket prices are going to be higher. So that's part of what you will see in the first quarter. As I talk about the third quarter, when I talked about being strong in the third quarter in particular, were festivals, and seeing our festival growth in the third quarter in stadium, and a lot of our stadium growth in the third quarter. Both of those venue types, just at a broad level, are high ticket price; because you are buying the more expensive full day ticket to the festival, and on average, your stadium pricing is going to be higher than your arena or amphitheater. So you should see some positive revenue per ticket or per ticket pricing from a mix in Q3 yet. Doug Arthur : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Rapino for closing remarks. Michael Rapino : All right. Thank you everybody and we will talk to you all in Q2. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Live Nation entertainment first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon. Welcome to our second quarter 2014 conference call. As we are now well into the third quarter, I'm confident we will have another record year in 2014 and deliver our planned revenue, AOI and free cash flow growth for the year and into 2015. All of our businesses continue to grow as we see strong global demand with all positive indicators on consumer spending for a lot of events. Against this backdrop, we are building global market share in Concerts and Ticketing, attracting new brands to our Sponsorship & Advertising platform, and have now fully aligned Artist Management with the rest of the company. As a result, our revenues are up 7% for the half and AOI, up 6% with all 4 divisions growing both top line and AOI through the first 2 quarters. To provide you an update on our core growth strategies, first, growing our global concerts market share, we have sold over 42 million tickets for shows this year, up 3% from this point last year. On the touring side, we're promoting 21 of the top 25 global tours this year, continuing to differentiate Live Nation as the partner of choice for touring artists. In festivals, we are continuing our strength in Europe and now building a much stronger portfolio in North America, where we now have 7 festivals that can attract over 100,000 people, up from just one such festival 2 years ago. This includes the Electric Daisy Carnival in Vegas with nearly 400,000 fans last month, making it the largest single weekend festival in the country. And globally, we will promote shows in 40 countries this year. We expect to have our strategy for Central and South America in place by the end of the year, establishing our next growth platform. Increasingly feeding the concert pipeline is our artist management position, and we expect over 40% growth in major artist shows promoted by Live Nation this year. With our repositioning of this business now complete, we have been in growth mode this year, adding such artists as U2, Lady Gaga, Alicia Keys, Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears, and are now managing over 250 artists. The Sponsorship & Advertising business continues to grow. We look forward about 80% of our plans, Sponsorship & Advertising for the year. Contracted sponsorships revenue is up 11% from this point last year, and we're now driving online advertising growth needed to deliver on our full year growth expectations. Sponsorships growth is coming from continued success for both festival platform and the additional and expansion of strategic relationships with major brands, including Budweiser, SAP, Kellogg's, Hertz and Citi. On the advertising side, we have a two-part strategy. First, we are growing advertising from the traffic coming to our site, up 23% in the past quarter as we added more content in Live Nation.com and relaunched our EDM content and insomniac.com. And second with Yahoo!, we now have launched our Live Nation channel, streaming a concert a today. Going forward, we see great opportunities for additional programming with Yahoo! and other distribution partners, which we believe will drive continued advertising growth. And finally, Ticketmaster is now delivering on its potential. With our technology investments powering new fan products and setting the foundation for continued growth. Our top product focus for the past year has been TicketMaster-Plus. And in July, we expect a 90% year-on-year increase in global secondary GTV, driven by a 600% increase in secondary concerts activity. This product has now been widely accepted by fans, teams and artists alike, and as a benefit to them, selling more tickets and keeping the secondary value within the content ecosystem. And as a result, we expect to capture over $1 billion in resale GTV since our launch last September through the end of this year. In primary tickets, we have sold $10 billion worth of tickets in the first half, and we continue to see a rapid shift to mobile ticketing, with nearly 40% growth in mobile ticket sales this year and 17% of tickets now purchased on our mobile platforms. As we have improved the ease by which the fans can buy, transfer and sell their tickets, and with 60% of tickets in North America now able to enter a show with a mobile bar code, we expect this to continue driving mobile growth and further Ticketmaster's distinctive proposition both fans and venues. As a result, we expect to deliver a net renewal rate of over 100% at Ticketmaster for the fifth straight year since the merger, clearly demonstrating that our investment at Ticketmaster are paying off and the confidence our partners have in the future of Ticketmaster. 2014 continues to be on track and I expect the company will deliver our fourth consecutive year of revenue, AOI and free cash flow growth and grow the profitability of each business. Longer term, I continue to see great ongoing growth opportunities for the company. The underlying demand for Live continue to be strong globally, and as one of the few truly borderless businesses we have numerous opportunities to increase our market share, and we have now shown that we can effectively drive scale in concerts and from that build our Sponsorship and Ticketing businesses, therefore, growing revenue, AOI and free cash flow. I will now turn it over to Joe to take you through the update of the divisions. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael. First, concerts. As I indicated on our last earnings call, with the timing of shows this year, our Q2 had lower show count than Q2 2013. As a result, revenue declined 2% and AOI is down 13%. Specifically, as I previously indicated, we had a substantial shift of arena activity from Q2 into Q1, so arena attendance for the quarter is down 14% though up 6% in total for the first half. Similarly, we're expecting our festival activity to weigh more heavily to Q3 this year and give us mid-single digit festival attendance growth for the year, despite Q2 festival attendance being down for the second quarter this year. Looking more broadly at other indicators, we're confident we will increase our market share and fan base this year. First, as Michael said, all of our tickets sold for the shows this year is over 42 million as of July 21, up 3% from this point last year. Our attendance per show was up 4% in the first half, led by arenas and stadiums. Also, as of the end of the first half, for the first time in the company's history, we sold over 2 million tickets per a single act, One Direction, which is in the midst of a highly successful global stadium tour. And this is indicative of the broad demand for concerts across all genres, venue types and markets. With our list of top-selling artists continuing to be diverse with such artists as Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, Luke Bryan and Lady Gaga. As a result, we're also seeing tremendous growth in our stadium business, which we expect to be up over 50% for the third quarter. And with this demand in the third quarter, we expect to achieve record attendance at our shows of 23 million fans in the 3-month period alone, which will put us up 4% through the first 3 quarters relative to 2013. And as a result, we believe any short-term timing on shows will be more than caught up over the next 2 months. And for the full year, we expect to build our market share, grow attendance and deliver double-digit AOI growth in concerts. On Artist Nation. For the quarter, both revenue and AOI are down on the division, driven by a combination of timing with our managers and their acts and are discontinuing some services in the division compared to last year. Despite this, revenue is up slightly for the first half and AOI remains up double digits year-to-date. And looking forward to the full year, on the strength of these new managers and artists that Michael discussed, we expect AOI to grow double digits for the business. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business. For the second quarter, revenue was flat and AOI up 4%, while for the first half, revenue is up 4% and AOI up 6%. The first half strength was driven by our sponsorships business in particular, as we had strong increases in our electronic festival and strategic sponsorship basis. The online part of the business is more heavily weighted in the second half this year with programs like Yahoo! as we discussed on our last earnings call. And we have been investing to get our full sales infrastructure in place in advance of this growth. At this point, with about 80% of our expected Sponsorship & Advertising sold for the year, we expect to deliver AOI growth for the year -- full year consistent with the past couple of years. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketing revenue was up 10%, while AOI was down 1%. And for the half, revenue was up 9% and AOI is up 7%. Our primary ticket sales were up 2% for the quarter and up 1% for the year through July 21. Secondary ticket activity has been particularly strong, as Michael noted, and is up over 30% through the first half with similar growth expected through the rest of the year. There was a slight margin impact for the quarter and half driven by our increased spend on consumer facing web and mobile products for both primary and secondary ticketing. We expect this to come back in the second half as we continue to scale the businesses and deliver margins in ticketing for the full year consistent with last year. Looking then in totality of ticketing for the full year, we continue to expect low single-digit growth in primary ticketing volume, strong growth in secondary GTV and low mid-single digit growth in ticketing AOI. Overall, 2014 is shaping up well as we expected. Beyond sales and concerts and ticketing sales trends overall give us visibility into the back half of the year, and we're confident that we will again grow our businesses in 2014 and continue on track to deliver our 3-year plan in 2015. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to take you through more details on our financials. Elizabeth K. Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with our results for the first half of 2014. Revenue for the 6 months was $2.8 billion, up 7% compared to last year, driven by concerts revenue increasing by 8% from higher arena, amphitheater and global touring activity. Ticketings revenue grew 9% in the first half due to higher primary and resell ticket volume, along with higher average ticket prices. AOI for the first half of the year was $225 million, up 6% over last year with improved performance across all of our segments. Concerts AOI increased 17% to $35 million from higher amphitheater, global touring and EDM results. Ticketing AOI was $147 million, up 7%, driven by higher global primary volume and average ticket prices due to mix of ticket types and improved secondary ticket sales. Sponsorship & Advertising AOI was up 6% to $75 million, driven by growth in strategic sponsorship programs and increased sales for EDM festivals. And Artist Nation AOI was up 12% to $8 million, driven by higher Artist Management activity. Corporate costs were up $3 million for the first 6 months, but we expect that these costs for the second half of this year will be more in line with the costs in the second half last year. Operating income was $43 million for the first 6 months versus what would have been $34 million in operating income last year without the $31 million higher gain on disposal of assets due to the sale of our New York theater and insurance recovery from hurricane damage that we received in 2013. Our 2013 reported operating income was $65 million. Net loss for the first half was a loss of $10 million, compared to what would have been a loss of $36 million in 2013 without the higher gains on disposal. Net loss on a reported basis for last year was $5 million. Turning to the details for the second quarter. Revenue was $1.7 billion this quarter, down 1% from last year, driven by concerts revenue decline of 2% from the shift of arena shows into the first quarter this year. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $142 million, down 11% year-over-year. Concerts AOI was down 13% to $37 million, impacted by the shift in arena activity the first quarter. Ticketing AOI was down 1% to $77 million. We saw growth from higher volumes across primary and resell, along with higher average ticket prices in primary, but the AOI was impacted by the investments in our technology products, along with not having the legal settlements we received last year. Sponsorship & Advertising AOI was up 4% to $49 million, driven by new and expanded strategic sponsorship programs and increased sales for EDM festival. And Artist Nation AOI was $3 million, down $5 million from last year due to the timing of artists tours and the discontinuation of certain services in this segment. Operating income was $56 million this quarter versus what would have been $71 million last year without the $26 million higher gain on disposal in the quarter. On a reported basis, our operating income was $98 million last year. The decline in operating income after the effect of the higher gains was primarily driven by the lower AOI in the quarter. Net income was $23 million this quarter versus what would have been net income of $32 million in 2013, again, without the higher gains on disposal. Net income on a reported basis for last year was $58 million. For the first half of the year, free cash flow was $110 million as compared to $117 million last year, impacted by the timing of payments and noncontrolling interest holders, which were $16 million higher in the quarter -- I'm sorry, in the 6 months. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $76 million versus $103 million last year with the decline coming from lower AOI and the timing of distributions to partners. Given our expected growth in AOI for the full year, we expect that free cash flow for the year as a percentage of our AOI will be roughly in line with 2013, up from the levels we have seen in 2011 and 2012. Cash flow from operations was $338 million for the first 6 months, down $42 million the last year due to higher payments for event-related expenses for concerts in the second half of the year, without the benefit of the cash related to the ticket sales of third-party buildings, since we don't receive those moneys until the show happens. As of June 30, we reported total cash of $2 billion, which includes net proceeds of $515 million from the May 2014 issuance of new senior notes and new convertible senior notes, and before the repayment of the $220 million of original convertible debt. Additionally, total cash includes $577 million in ticketing client cash, and $555 million in net feature concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $910 million. Total event related deferred revenue as of June 30 was flat to last year at $858 million. As we have noted, we expect increased stadium activity in the third quarter, and as of June, our total ticket sales for stadium events in the second half of 2014 are up more than 50% over last year. Since we do not receive these events ticket sales at venues in which we don't own or operate, these stadium ticket sales are not included in our June balances for deferred revenue, cash or in cash flow from operations. Our total capital expenditures year-to-date were $61 million with $32 million set for maintenance CapEx and $29 million on revenue-generating additions. For the full year, CapEx is expected to be approximately $135 million, which is consistent with our expected rate of about 2% of revenue, and around half of this will be spent on revenue-generating projects, including Ticketmaster technology products. In July, holders of $29 million of our 2.875% convertible senior notes put their notes back to the company for repayment. We are now in the process of redeeming the remaining $191 million of these notes and expect to complete the process by late September. As of June 30, our total debt was $2.3 billion, which includes the $220 million of convertible senior notes. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding debt discounts and including the debt premium is 4.2%, and without the addition of convertible debt, this weighted average cost of debt would have been 4.3%. Our debt covenant currently requires a maximum leverage ratio of 5.25x, and we are comfortable in compliance with this as of June 30. After adjusting for the expected repayment of the $220 million of convertible debt, our debt leverage ratio is comfortably less than 4x for the period. Looking forward, we continue to expect to deliver growth in revenue, AOI and free cash flow in 2014, and to grow the overall profitability of each of our segments, while continuing to invest in and to build our businesses to set them up for continued growth. Thank you for joining us today. And we will now open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Vasily Karasyov with Sterne. Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Just to clarify that did I understand correctly that you say that some of the year-over-year declines in the quarter for some segments, that's expected and nothing changes with the full-year guidance and your 3-year guidance? And then I would like some commentary please on where potentially could you go for acquisitions, now that you have so much cash on the balance sheet. And should we expect the order of magnitude of potential deals to be outside of historical range than where it was in the past 3 years? Michael Rapino : Thank you. Yes, to the first question, yes. As most of you know, we had a record year last year in attendance and concerts. We had a high bar, and we expected this year to beat last year from overall revenue, and then ultimately AOI and free cash flow. When you're looking at the year versus last year, we had an exceptionally strong Q1 this year. We knew last year was a strong Q2. Have lots of certain tours on the road at that time, and we knew that we're going to have a very strong Q3 this year. So we knew in totality we look at the year in total, whether Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 tour in June or July, we're not sure at the beginning of the year, but we knew our Q3 was going to be very strong. We weren't obsessed with leading our Q2 last year, we didn't do the activity there, but we know on a year-on basis we're going to end up exactly as we planned, growth AOI, revenue, free cash flow and finish off another record year. As far as... Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Acquisition? Michael Rapino : Yes, as far as acquisitions, you're going to continue see us look on a global basis. I referenced that this is a unique industry, it's borderless unlike most media entertainment with many regulations that they have around the world and what markets they can own what they can't. This is a borderless business. And that's why we're in 40 countries and counting. Our products called the tour, Jay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9, our global brands and becoming more and more global daily, thanks to the world wide web and connected world. So we're going to continually build out our platform in markets, and you're going to see us make sure that we protect our portfolio of festivals and grow those, and continue to look at any acquisitions that will further our ticketing portfolio. So open and always looking for the accretive deal that can help grow our business long-term. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Tinker with Maxim. John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division : Could you just talk a little bit about that ticketing margins in the quarter? And given that StubHub now appears to be stumbling a little bit from layoff. What is the kind of margin we should be expecting or should think about from a secondary ticket sales, which obviously, I think you highlighted were up 30% the first half of the year? Joe Berchtold : John, this is Joe. So on the margins for the second quarter, as I said on the call, it's simply a matter of a little bit of lumpiness in terms of some costs that we have with product development focus for both the primary and secondary products. And in totality, you should see margins for ticketing consistent with last year's margins. Secondary, at the end, obviously, builds our volume, builds our scale, which is great. It's not structurally different from primary, and it's overall economic so it becomes the same ballpark of contribution margin and AOI. But obviously, as we continue the strong growth in that business, it continues to give us more scale at Ticketmaster, which then, over time, will drive both the AOI and the cash. So we're very happy with how it's done. Michael gave the numbers on a [indiscernible] blockbuster July that we have, which is really a concert-driven month if you look at the seasonality of the sports weeks. And overall with 30% growth through the first half and that kind of in totality expected for the full year, it's clearly very, very strong growth. John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division : Just a quick follow-up. The Concert business with Yahoo! which I think is most innovative. Which line are you reporting that revenue in? And secondly, what -- how material is this in terms of absolute dollars? How many listeners might you get? Joe Berchtold : So the streaming of the concerts feel that the advertising against those shows is part of the Sponsorship & Advertising segment. Obviously, the concerts themselves, because those are -- all our concerts is in the Concerts segment. And given the timing of the rollout of the shows, it started in July. So it obviously is going to be a second half set of economics. We obviously expect and Yahoo! expects to have attractive Sponsorship & Advertising against the shows well in excess of the cost of the shows. We haven't broken out specific viewership at this point. We may later on, but we haven't done that yet. More broadly, we look at this as this is the launch of our first show. And we're shipping out to where we're not just monetizing the $30 million odd unique to comes to our Live Nation and Ticketmaster platforms every year. But we're truly monetizing the 23,000 shows and 60 million fans we have, working with other partners that have tremendous distribution reach and taking that monetization to another level. And we expect this we deploy more programs that just collectively builds up to be a significant scale and is one of the key drivers of our ongoing strong growth in the Sponsorship & Advertising business. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong - Macquarie Research : Two questions. First on Advertising & Sponsorship. You're 80% sold out at this point, and it's July. Can you just help us think through the cadence of the growth for 3Q and 4Q? And, obviously, 3Q is seasonally strong and you have the Yahoo! deal, but if could you just help us think through the cadence of the growth and also the margin profile for 3Q and 4Q? And then my second question is on Artist Nation. Can you just help us walk through the reduction in the quarter related to the VIP and the outsourcing? And is that something that we should be thinking about going forward? And then I guess, the 2 acquisitions that you made in the Artist Management business. Joe Berchtold : Sure. So on the -- let me work backwards, on the Artist Nation, I think we stopped doing some VIP and other programs in that business. The concert business decided that it was better to do it in-house as part of their touring activities. So it's within -- still the overall Live Nation activity is occurring, it's just a shift, really, from your perspective. There was a bit then of other just tiny seasonality on some of the merchandise sales side and the overall Artist Management, but again, that's just timing similar to our concerts timing a bit first versus second versus third quarter. We expect that piece of it to catch up without any issues. On the advertising and sponsorship piece. So when we say 80% sold, that is against the total Sponsorship & Advertising that we expect to be sold for the year. We sold about 80% of it today. That's pretty consistent with what we would have sold last year in terms of the percent total sale. It's early front half loaded for the sale of it, the execution and revenue recognition of that Sponsorship & Advertising then takes place in a cadence over the course of the full year. I think for the second half, we gave the numbers, and we expect our total AOI growth to be consistent with the past few years. I think as we start to see some scaling on the advertising side of it, you see the margins in the back half looking more like the margins would have last year. I think in totality, I don't have all the numbers in front of me, that would put us sort of slightly lower margin, but still in the kind of the 65% to 70% range for the business for the year. Elizabeth K. Willard: And Amy, on that Live Nation activity, we moved that out in third quarter of last year, so you'll be consistent year-over-year from that plan. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Joyce with International Strategy and Investment Group. David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : A couple of things. On the excess free cash that you have now after the convert redemption, how quickly do you expect to deploy that? Is the majority of that going to go through the Latin American opportunities you've mentioned earlier, or perhaps by the end of the year? How should we think about that? Michael Rapino : Well, there's no timeline. Our job has been to grow the business over the last few years, start to generate some considerable cash flow that we can invest back in the business. We've been doing that, and we are always running around the world looking at opportunities in all of our markets that we think can help grow our business. So no timeline. If the opportunity is right, and we think it's an asset that can help leverage our core businesses within, we would look to do something. But we have a strong global platform. We're going to grow this business organically and the rest of the acquisitions are opportunistic if we think they can help accelerate growth in any of our course. David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : All right. And separately, the international events independents were down in the low double digits in the second quarter. Is that primarily where you're seeing the shifting of events? I know you've talked about having more stadium events in the third quarter, so does that mean the stadium events were internationally based? I was just wondering if any festivals of note were shifting into the third quarter. Michael Rapino : No. I mean, generally, when we look at the year, we tend to have a good view on the year obviously, by March and April, we tend to know kind of what is exactly going to be going on throughout the year from a stadium to a festival to an arena tour. And nothing inconsistent in any business that we didn't predict, meaning whatever is soft or down slightly in Q2 was probably up in Q1 in the arenas in Europe. We will be stronger in Q3 in the back end festivals in Europe. So again, just on an annual basis, we see a totality of all the different segments will be growing. David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : And finally, I don't think you've mentioned it, but when do you think you'll be done with the sort of incremental or the doubling of expenses on that Ticketmaster replant forming? Has that been accelerated somewhat? Joe Berchtold : David, it's Joe. With regards to the stand on Ticketmaster, I think, at this point, we feel like we've gotten through the bulk of that spend as it relates to revamping the core search inventory management system checkout, and we now deployed major product using the new technology meaning the TicketMaster-Plus. What we're also seeing is that as a technology business, you have to continue to deploy great new products, and you see TicketMaster-Plus with their view from the seats and other innovations and the mobile coming out with new products. So as Kathy gave you guidance on with overall CapEx levels, I think you'll see some continued investment in Ticketmaster as we go forward given the nature of its business today. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Evercore. Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Kathy, the number that jumps out to me is the SG&A number in totality up 10% and particularly, I mean you site some acquisitions as driving big increase in SG&A at Artist Nation. Was that -- I mean, is the SG&A in line with your expectation? And is this part of the whole timing issue where you continue to spend, because you expect to get a lot of the revenues back in the third quarter? Can you just put some perspective on that? Elizabeth K. Willard: Yes, there's some FX impact, which we've called out. That's impacting that, but yes, it's timing within Ticketmaster, it's timing at some third-party consulting, in corporate. And yes, it's in line with where we expected this year to be at this point. And obviously, another thing I mentioned, I guess was the, we had some legal settlements in Ticketing last year, which we have reduction on those costs. And so year-over-year, there is an increase on that. Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Okay, right. And then in terms of the specific increase in Artist Nation, I mean could you site some acquisition-related reasons, but I mean that really jumped up a lot in that smaller segment. Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think there's some timing there in terms of some payouts that we had with some managers on some of these acquisitions that made it much lumpier than you would normally expect SG&A to be. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rich Tullo with Albert Fried & Company. Richard Tullo - Albert Fried & Company, LLC, Research Division : Real quick. With the cash available expanding to $910 million, you have the convertible call coming up. Does it make -- since your leverage ratio is way down, does it make any sense to take on some debt and restructure the balance sheet a little bit and buy back some stock? Elizabeth K. Willard: Rick, I think that's what we did in May, getting ready for that convertible coming up. And because we felt the market was right, and we've got good pricing on it, we borrow that from now, which is obviously driving a lot of that free cash, which is the $500 million that we just recently borrowed. Richard Tullo - Albert Fried & Company, LLC, Research Division : Second question. Have you guys been investigating at all the ability of Live Nation to take some real assets and turn them into REITs? Joe Berchtold : Yes, we've analyzed this over time. It sounds good on theory, but we don't actually really own real estate. Both of the business you see when we say we own and operate is just city leases. So Jones beach in New York, we don't own that asset we're just having it leased to operate it, and all the economics are in the operation of it. So if you tried to take any of those assets and put them in another REIT, you have no core business operating revenue coming back to you. So we have looked at it over the years, we don't have enough assets that would produce the return we would expect. Operator : We'll take our next question from Martin Pyykkonen with Rosenblatt Securities. Martin Pyykkonen : I don't know if you said this, but as far as Q3 that we're now another point here in Q2 was hard fewer concert arena shows. Can you at all quantify how much more you have as far as the shows, the number shows and/or for Q3? I'm not talking about ticket goals. And then looking into Q4, I speak if I remember it last year this time, Q4 was looking pretty good from a show inventory standpoint. I'm wondering how that looks this year and what you're sort of factoring into your guidance for the full year, probably can back until you just maybe pull out Q4 even though it's far off, I'm not talking again about tickets sold, or the outlook for ticket sales in the Q4, just for show inventory. Michael Rapino : Yes. So on Q3, what we said is we expect to sell sorry about 23, sorry about that -- have attendance of about 23 million fans. So collectively through the first 3 quarters we're up 4% year-on-year. I believe last year's Q3 attendance was just over 21 million. I don't have the exact number in front of me. As regards to Q4, we think it's solid, there's still of pieces of that in motion, but we think -- we'll be solid and will lead to what I said is a double-digit growth in concerts AOIs for the full year. Martin Pyykkonen : Okay. And just, I know it's not a big number in the big picture for you, but the alley form was in your backyard almost about 6 months now starting with the eagles. Can you talk at all about what your sort of market share is, number shows are actually going on there with respect for capacity utilization. And I'm assuming you have pretty good market share. Obviously, it is in the area a bit more dedicated to stable and so forth. Any color on the alley form in terms of how that is going for you and how meaningful. Michael Rapino : When we back for the MSG, the call. We're -- MSG in general is a great partner to us both in New York and L.A.. They are long-term and continued Ticketmaster and TicketMaster-Plus clients, and we have been very successful and in form this year promoting a lot of concerts in that venue. So any place the ticket is sold under Ticketmaster with our concert the economics are good for us. So the venue has been a success for us, we've sold lots of tickets, and it's good to have another option in any market for our content. Operator : And we'll hear again from Rich Tullo from Albert Fried & Company. Richard Tullo - Albert Fried & Company, LLC, Research Division : The last time you talked about market share in the secondary market, you're around 10%. Are we approaching a number like 20%, 25% now? Joe Berchtold : Well, we said it's up 30% for the first half and expect it to be 30% for the full year. So maybe 30% to 10%, it's not quite that high yet. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time. Michael Rapino : All right. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2014 conference call. I'm joined today by Joe Berchtold, our COO; and Kathy Willard, our CFO. We had a great third quarter, and 2014 is on track to be another record year, delivering revenue, AOI and free cash flow growth. For the first 9 months of the year, revenue was up 9% and AOI is up 11%, with all divisions growing both top line [ph] and AOI. Our business model of building the leading concerts platform as a flywheel, driving our other high-margin businesses is working. We are continuing to build share in Concerts and Artist Management and driving growth in Sponsorship and Ticketing. The Live business continues to have a robust outlook as artists are now fully reliant on touring as their main earnings driver, and the best means to engage and connect with their fan base. The ongoing flow of new artists continues to reemphasize the business as fans, more than ever, find the Live experience from club shows to stadiums to festivals a top entertainment choice and the best means to celebrate their favorite artist and share the experience with friends, both on-site and online. The connected world and mobile access allows fans to become the greatest marketing boom for artists and concerts. Our research shows 64% of concertgoers engage in online activities at the show, and 76% of concert attendees in the U.S. who took photos or videos at the concert post them online. All of this is generating billions of earned media impressions on social media for our shows. At Live Nation, we see great continued runway ahead given the fragmented global landscape in concerts management and ticketing. And as our scale grows, we continue to drive increasing economics in our business model with higher profits per show, more advertising and improved ticket conversion. I'll now provide you an update on our core strategies. First, we continue to grow our global concerts market share. Fan demand remains strong globally, and we are continuing to grow by taking share, building 22 of the top 25 global tours this year, including Jay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9, One Direction and Luke Bryan. We also further growing our festivals portfolio, and we are expecting nearly 5 million fans across 65 global festivals with 8% growth from 2013, and we continue to add more markets to our global footprint by promoting concerts now in 40 countries, adding an office in the Philippines this quarter, and we increased our attendance per show. Artist Management is now operating in full gear as we have attracted a number of new managers to this group, repping acts including Madonna, Lady Gaga, Alicia Keys, Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, Nicki Minaj and Lil' Wayne. The Sponsorship & Advertising business continues to deliver strong margins and growth to drive our overall AOI. At this point, we have sold over 90% of our planned sponsorships and advertising for the year, and contracted revenue is up 10% from this point last year. The success of our Live Nation channel at Yahoo! demonstrated the potential we have in further monetizing our concerts platform, creating compelling content that we can widely distribute and drive advertising revenue. We have now delivered over 100 continuous days of a live show a night with millions of viewers tuning in to watch. With this proof of concept successful, we look to expand and grow our live streaming and content products to further provide advertisers with a focused suite of products from Live Nation. We believe we have great growth opportunities as we improve the advertising experience for brands that want to reach that highly desirable music fan, on-site and on all screens, in a highly targeted fashion. Our combination of on-site access, engaging content and data provides a unique and compelling network for advertisers. And finally, Ticketmaster, finally continues to deliver on its 3 priorities : First, our TicketMaster+ product is working even better than our expectation of a year ago. It has been activated from over 13,000 events since it's launched last September and year-on-year, global secondary GTV is up 44% year-to-date. The broad adoption of the platform by fans and teens gives us confidence that we'll capture over 1 billion in new sale GTV since our launch last September through the end of 2014 with continued growth momentum into '15. Second, our mobile platform continues to grow rapidly as we make ongoing improvements to the mobile experience for fans to buy, transfer, sell and scan their tickets. The number of tickets sold on mobile platform is up 33% for the first 3 quarters, accounting for 18% of total ticket sales. And at the same time, we remain committed to delivering the best fan experience on every platform and lowering our cost structure as we do so. We continue to deploy new products this year, but we will continue to reduce our costs by up to $0.15 for tickets this year, ahead of schedule and over -- and halfway to our achieved goal of $0.35 per ticket. As we near the end of 2014, Live Nation has never been in a stronger position. We have built the best live platform in the world and we are successfully leveraging our platform to build adjacent high-margin businesses. We are on track to deliver our 3-year strategic plan for 2015, and have great confidence in our longer-term growth opportunities in our core lanes of Concerts, Advertising and Ticketing. I'll now turn the call over to Joe who will take you through an update on these divisions. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael. First, with Concerts. In the third quarter, Concert revenue increased 11%, and AOI was up 17% compared to 2013. We had record fan attendance for the quarter as expected, with 22 million people attending our shows. The growth this quarter was driven by North America and, notably, a tripling of our stadium business. Looking more broadly at our full year-to-date, which does a better job of smoothing out timing. We've had a record 46 million fans attend our shows, delivering commensurate record profitability. We've seen that having a broad portfolio of markets and venue types continues to pay off for us as this year, we had a high volume of stadium shows and strong performance in amps and across festivals to grow the overall business. We're also continuing to increase our profitability for fans with pricing per ticket up 6% on a global basis and per-fan spending in our amphitheaters and festivals up 6% as well. Looking at the fourth quarter and full year, we continue to expect to deliver double-digit AOI growth in the concert business. The fourth quarter looks to continue our trend of a bit lower arena activity, but we still expect to end the year with record attendance as we continue to build our global market share. On Artist Nation. Our Artist Management business had another great quarter as well, with revenue up 18% and AOI up 73%. Again, here, we expect to see a bit lower activity from timing in the fourth quarter, but overall, for the year, project revenue and AOI growth along with a strong lineup set for 2015. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business. For the third quarter, Sponsorship & Advertising revenue was up 4%, and AOI up 6%, consistent with our year-to-date performance. Our top focus for the year has been on taking our advertising business to the next level, leveraging our content platform to create products we can monetize through third-party platforms. Our live streaming show is the first example of this success with more to come soon. Now the second focus has been continuing to build the breadth and depth of our strategic sponsorship relationships, and we now have over 50 sponsors spending over $1 million each a year with Live Nation. As we look to 2014 in total for Sponsorship & Advertising, given where we are with contracted revenue, we continue to expect AOI growth consistent with the past few years with a strong fourth quarter and more back-end activity this year. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketing revenue was up 8%, while AOI was up 7%. And year-to-date revenue was up 9% and AOI is up 7%, as we have processed over 300 million primary tickets totaling over $15 billion in gross transaction value, up 5% year-on-year. And as Michael said, our secondary ticketing gross transaction value is up 44% year-to-date. These growth rates, along with our expectation of, again, delivering a net renewal rate of over 100% for the year, indicates that Ticketmaster's platform is continuing to deliver a great value proposition to both fans and venues. For fans, our integrated primary and secondary is not only driving growth in our secondary business, but increasing overall conversion. In general, we have seen that fans are 30% more likely to buy a ticket when they see both primary and secondary tickets together, versus just what's left of their primary options. And at the same time, our mobile offerings are making it easier for fans to buy and manage their tickets and our continued rapid transition is further reinforcing Ticketmaster's multi-platform leadership. Our venue clients also continue to see the benefits of our ongoing technology investments as we have had a big push into mobile products for them as well this year, growing our mobile box office and mobile reporting products. Looking at Ticketing for the fourth quarter and full year, we expect to maintain our momentum of continued secondary growth, capture improvements in our cost structure and have another strong fourth quarter of on sales for 2015. Collectively, we expect this to deliver mid-single-digit AOI growth for the business for the full year. Overall, we had a great third quarter and expect to deliver our fourth consecutive year of revenue AOI and free cash flow growth and grow the profitability at each of our businesses. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to take you through more details on our financials. Elizabeth K. Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with our results for the third quarter. Revenue was $2.5 billion, up 11% from last year. Concerts revenue was also up 11%, primarily due to more shows and higher attendance in North America from several successful stadium tours, along with increased sales in amphitheaters. Ticketing revenue was up 8% driven by higher domestic resale fees as a result of the continuing success of our TM+ product, along with increases in primary ticket revenue. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $258 million, up 17% from last year's $221 million. Concerts AOI was $83 million, up 17% from the strong stadium activity in North America. Ticketing AOI was $86 million, up 7% from the growth in domestic primary and Resale revenue. Sponsorship & Advertising AOI was $88 million, up 6%, driven by growth in international venue and festival sponsorship and domestic online advertising. And Artist Nation AOI was $22 million, a $9 million increase over last year from higher management commissions from existing managers and the additional several new managers. Operating income was $151 million this quarter, 19% higher than the $126 million reported last year, driven by the growth in AOI. And net income in the third quarter was $105 million versus $44 million in 2013. The improvement in net income was driven by our higher operating income, lower income tax expense this quarter associated with deferred tax benefits from acquisitions and the loss on debt refinancing we had last year. Now for the 9-month results. Revenue was $5.3 billion, up 9% over last year. The increase was driven by a 10% growth in Concerts revenue due to more shows and higher attendance in our North American amphitheaters and strong stadium tours along with increased global touring activity. Ticketing revenue was up 9%, driven by higher domestic primary ticket volume and fees, along with higher Resale tickets fees. AOI for the 9 months is $483 million, 11% higher than last year, as we grew profitability in all of our business segments. Concerts AOI increased by 17% to $117 million from increased amphitheater and stadium activity in North America. Ticketing AOI was $232 million, a 7% increase from the growth domestically in primary and Resale ticket sales. Sponsorship & Advertising AOI grew 6% year-over-year to $163 million due to the growth in North America sponsorships in online advertising, along with increased venue sponsorships internationally. And Artist Nation AOI grew from $20 million for the first 9 months of 2013 to $30 million in 2014 from higher management commissions. Operating income was $194 million for the 9 months, 27% ahead of the $153 million we would have reported last year without the $38 million higher gain on disposal of assets, an increase consistent with our AOI growth. On a reported basis, our operating income was up $3 million from $191 million in 2013. For the 9 months, net income was $96 million, up from $39 million reported last year, with the growth coming from operating income along with a $27 million decrease in our income tax expense driven by a reduction in taxable foreign earnings and deferred tax benefits associated with acquisitions. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $198 million, 19% higher than last year, driven by our higher AOI. Free cash flow for the 9 months was $308 million versus $283 million last year, with the growth primarily due to the increase in AOI less higher CapEx and noncontrolling interest distributions. As we noted in our last quarterly call, we still expect that free cash flow for the year as a percentage of AOI will be roughly in line with our 2013 results. Cash flow from operations was a negative $14 million for the 9 months compared to $265 million last year. This swing came from 3 of our working capital lines, all reflecting short-term timing impacts. Accounts receivable were up about $90 million, following the very high volume of stadium shows in this quarter with several in the latter part of the quarter not yet settled at the end of September. Prepaid expenses and other assets were also up about $90 million, driven primarily by artist advances for tours in 2015. In general, we are more than willing to extend advances to more tours as we continue building our global Concerts business. And accrued liabilities and AP were down about $130 million, largely from the timing of ticketing client on sales versus last year. All 3 of these factors are merely short-term timing and, in general, Concerts remain an attractive working capital business. We expect much of this timing anomaly to work its way through the system by yearend with more comparable levels of receivables and payables at that point. As of September 30, after redeeming the $220 million of our original convertible debt and completing our largest quarter of the year in terms of show activity, we reported total cash of $1.4 billion. This includes $532 million of Ticketing client cash and $186 million of net future concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $640 million, up approximately $100 million from this time last year. Total event-related deferred revenue as of September 30 was $319 million, slightly higher than the $313 million we reported in September last year. Our total capital expenditures through September were $89 million, with $47 million spent for maintenance CapEx projects and the remaining amount spent on revenue-generating projects. For the full year 2014, we continue to expect that total capital expenditures will be approximately $135 million, around 2% of revenue. After redeeming the full $220 million of our original convertible debt this quarter, our total debt was $2.1 billion as of September 30. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding the debt discounts and including the debt premium on our term loans and notes, was 4.3%. Our debt covenant currently requires a maximum leverage ratio of 5.25x, and we are comfortably in compliance of below 4x as of September 30. In the third quarter, we delivered the strong results we expected and we are excited about the growth we delivered across all the business segments. Looking forward to the end of the year, we continue to expect to deliver growth in revenue, AOI and free cash flow and to grow the overall profitability of each of our segments while continuing to invest in and to build our businesses to set them up for continued growth in the future. Thank you for joining us today for an overview of our record third quarter results. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee. Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : I had a question on the secondary tickets market. Can you please quantify what percentage of the -- or what portion of the revenue growth came from secondary? I think in the 10-Q, you said that the majority of your growth came from there. And if you could give us an idea about the margin profile of that revenue, how different it is from the primary. Michael Rapino : If I'm not -- so we said the secondary growth was up 44% year-to-date. I'm not sure I fully understood the question. But the margin profile, as we've said, is very consistent with our primary tickets. We have margins that we expected, over time, as that business scales, to be consistent with kind of that rather mid-20s range. Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : My question was if you look at the revenue growth year-on-year, what percentage of that revenue increase came from secondary? Michael Rapino : Yes, we haven't -- we are not breaking that out. Operator : We'll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong - Macquarie Research : One question and then one follow-up, if I could. First, I was wondering if you could actually comment on some of the acquisitions that have been talked about in the Industry Rag [ph], including C3 and also Greek Theatre [ph]. And I guess, now that you're wrapping up your CapEx spend, what are your priorities for free cash flow? And then just one really quick housekeeping question. Can you just give us, Kathy, what the right share count is given all the different convertible activity that's been going on and what the right number we should be using going forward? Michael Rapino : Amy, it's Michael. I didn't -- we don't -- we've historically just not commented on our acquisitions until we close them. I think it would be fair to say, we've been very vocal on our priorities over the last couple of years, that we are continuing to grow our global Concerts business, whether that means the festival channels, like we did with EDM. We've been very clear that we've been underserviced in our festival business in the U.S. There's a big hole for our business, which really drives our Ticketing and then Sponsorship, and we're going to continue to grow internationally. So I can't comment on the rumors, but it would make sense that we would be looking to acquire a strong festival company in the U.S. that we've outlined already as a priority for us for cash flow, and we're going to continue to rally it. There is a lot of great global opportunities and sizable ones in the Ticketing and Concerts space that would continue to supercharge our growth if the price and the return was at the right level. Elizabeth K. Willard: And Amy, on the share count, on basic level, I'd used the number on front of the Q, which is the 200.7 million. On a diluted basis, you're right. It's because of the timing of when we bought in that convert. The diluted is a little bit high, and if you want use the diluted we use, I'd take out about 8 million shares, which would take you down to more like 213 million on a diluted basis, on a comparable basis. Operator : All right, and we'll take our next question from John Janedis with Jefferies LLC. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the Sponsorship segment? Growth seems a little below trend year-to-date and I'm wondering if there's anything timing for us to think about or maybe any change in renewal rates. Michael Rapino : Yes. That's why we tried to give you some very specific numbers in terms of being up 10% on a contracted revenue basis relative to last year, to give you some comfort but even though what we have recognized thus far year-to-date is at a lower trend, we gave you that, we're over 90% sold and we're up 10% year-on-year. So we think that should give some comfort that we will continue to grow at that historical rate that we've done in the past few years. So it will be more fourth quarter backloaded this year. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Joe, on that 10%, for example, is the average length the same? Or is that a bit extended? Joe Berchtold : There's no material change in the duration of our average sponsorship deal. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. One related question -- or unrelated question I should say. I know it's early, but is there any evidence that your channel in Yahoo! is driving growth or efficiencies across other parts of the Live Nation platform? Michael Rapino : Well, in the ecosystem, we're -- we know that any way we can continue to add ad units to our advertising businesses, how we very clearly outlined how we continue to grow. So one of the holes in our portfolio to date has been that video. So Yahoo! was able to provide us enough eyeballs with our content. So my advertising team now, when they're walking in to deliver against those RFPs, has an ad unit on video. So our Sponsorship business was sole benefit of that strategy. And then on a secondary point, we don't have any evidence yet that, that scale that would've mattered. But we do know from our research that the average fan, when he's debating about going to a concert, the casual fan, he spends a couple of weeks shopping. And we know that the #1 way that you can get a casual fan to press the buy button is by a live video of that artist, is a very stimulating conversion tool. So we do know is the more we scale and bring a high-quality live experience to the fan and add a buy button, we know it's also a great conversion mechanism for our core business. So it will be core benefit. It's a sponsorship ad unit, and a longer-term benefit is conversion around the ticket. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Tinker with Maxim. John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division : 8% festival attendance growth, how much of that was organic? Michael Rapino : That will be all basically organic because we had the full year in. So we started -- we launched -- as we do every year, we organically launch across the globe from our various 30, 40 markets, we launch 8 to 10 festivals a year and organically see which one of those ones are able to sustain M.I.A. in Los Angeles. We launched the country one in Detroit and we launched a few across the U.K. and Europe. So mostly organic and continuing -- we'll continue to do both organic and bolt-ons to remain as the leader in the Festivals segment. John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division : And as a follow-up, as the festival business tends to have a -- can have a margin of 25% as opposed to the promotion business, which can be sort of 2% to 4%, at some point, would you see your margin in the Concerts division starting to tick up as festivals become a bigger percentage? Michael Rapino : Well, first of all, our revenue is so big on our main line business that affecting the bottom line margin on our business, even with 65 festivals or 100 festivals, is always just a hard math game because of our massive growth across our 25,000-plus main line shows. But your core -- the core to the question is why we're in Sponsorship and Festivals. Remember, a concert may have a 4% margin business at the door, but the -- an amphitheater concert may be 4% on the door, but still it's a 20%, 30%, 40% margin business when you add sponsorship to it. So we know that when you have any type of concert where you control the environment, your sponsorship is going to be highly accretive to that proposition. So festivals in Europe are driven by sponsorship, and so our U.S. ones and they are a key product, if you want to call, to grow your core Sponsorship business. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from David Joyce with International Strategy & Investment Group. David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : I was wondering if you could provide some more color as to your recent acquisitions in Belgium. Does that provide you now the full complement of assets and activities there? If you could talk about what else you've got in that country. And then secondly, how does Eventjoy fit into your Ticketing product set? Michael Rapino : Yes. Belgium is a perfect example of why our model and our scale works. We have a very large Festivals and Concerts business in Belgium. We have not had a concert -- hadn't had any Ticketing business in Belgium so we are always weighing the options of buying the large one, starting our own or finding a smaller acquisition that provides us a faster ramp-up, and Belgium was the perfect example where we were able to find a relatively inexpensive backroom. And overnight, we have our content now with our Ticketmaster support from U.K. to be now a legitimate ticketing and concert business in Belgium. So we're always looking where we have content. In those 40 markets around the world, we would have an ongoing business development assessment on launch it or buy it and what's the best return, and Belgium is an example where that came to life and you'll continue to see that model and those -- of those 2 extremes come together. Eventjoy is similar to what we originally did with TicketWeb. We believe that Ticketmaster+ is a -- obviously, a fabulous mainstream brand that's going to continue to do and service its mainstream clients. We have a great company in TicketWeb that's out there every day fighting other competitors on the GA [ph] club business. And we knew that we need a do-it-yourself product to be able to enter that subspace. We wanted again to enter at a fairly low risk to understand the category. And then the magic with our scale is we like to go in low cost, learn and then provide the scale of Ticketmaster to excel the growth. So Eventjoy, a really strong product team. We like the individuals. We like the product. We're going to learn a lot about that space this year, and we're already looking at ways that we can help attach the fire hose to propel that business in that space. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Ben Mogil with Stifel Financial. Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Michael, so on the cost savings, which, I think, you sort of moved from $0.10 to $0.15 on the North American Ticketing side, can you talk about what sort of drove the push forward, if you will, about it? And then on the $0.35 target, do you see more upside from there? And then sort of as a follow-on, what about the international front? Can you give us the time line there around the ticket savings? Michael Rapino : I'm going to let Joe take that one. Joe Berchtold : Sure, yes. So Ben, as you've indicated, we previously guided to $0.10, and just our overall technology investments that we're making are letting us move a little faster than we had thought, 3, 6 months ago, and we're taking now more costs aggressively as we can to capture that for everybody. So combined with what we had already captured before this year, this is why we said we're more than halfway through the $0.35 target. And we think that overall, we are on target or on track with next year's getting to a run rate of $0.35. I don't think we're ready to declare that as something that will exceed at this point, but we certainly understand that, over time, one of the keys to Ticketmaster's success is we are truly omnipresent in all the channels of online, mobile and so on as having a very efficient cost structure-wide platform. And then our plan is, yes, that as we get that technology fully deployed in the U.S., we then take that to our markets internationally. Again, I don't think we're ready for the public declaration on the timing of that, but that is absolutely the plan. Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And so maybe on -- and just the U.S. because, obviously, you're further ahead there. When do you think, and you don't have to give me like an actual date, but approximately, when are you thinking you can kind of take the training wheels off the new system and kind of close down the legacy systems? Michael Rapino : Yes. So I think as we've talked, this is redoing it as we go, modules being replaced like by new modules. So there are no training wheels in the approach that we've taken. We are redoing the pieces as we go. I think we'll have complete products in our Concerts segment before long that won't have any of remnant core components of inventory management or e-commerce to them, and then we'll roll it out, aligned with the timing of the sports leagues to those teams over the next couple of years.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2014 conference call. Live Nation continues to be the global in the live event industry with another record year. In 2014 the company grew AOI by 10%, revenue by 6% and free cash flow by 9%. We continue to see the tremendous power of live events with strong consumer global demand. Live is truly a unique entertainment form it cannot be duplicated, it is elevated not threatened by technology and it\u2019s borderless. Fans around the world can now discover, follow, share and artist creating a greater demand for live shows. Technology is also transforming ticketing. Ticket sales are continuing the rapid shift to mobile with 35% growth in 2014 to 18% of total ticket sales leading to a higher fan engagement conversion and a better purchase flow. We believe the Live business will continue to have a strong growth for years to come, as connected fans drive demands, artist are motivated to tour and mobile technology drives conversion. Starting with our Concert division, in 2014 we built on a record 2013 are growing concert's revenue 5%. We again grew our global market share as we promoted the majority of 22 to the top 25 global tours. At the same time, we continue to expand our global footprint in the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia while also building our portfolio of marquee festival assets with the acquisition of Austin City Limits and Lollapalooza. Our Artist Management Business, AOI grew by 50% as we attracted more managers to Live Nation including U2, Madonna, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Britney Spears, Alicia Keys. And it drives our Concert business as Live Nation promoted over 700 shows in 2014 more than double that of 2012 with a high percentage of these artist activating TN plus. For this expanded concert base, we again grew our advertising business at a double-digit pace to 10% increase in AOI for the year and our highest margin business at over 70%. And our online business AOI grew even faster at 15%. This growth was driven by two initiatives. First, we\u2019ve remained focused on growing our fan network, increasing traffic by 17% for a total of over one billion visitors throughout the year. And second, we\u2019re not monetizing our content, notably our deal with Yahoo to stream our live concert everyday, which has driven increased interest by advertisers to our online platform to have an incremental business. Yahoo and Live are just the beginning of our entry into the media space, driving advertising with high-quality, live music related video offerings that will continue to expand and drive advertising growth. Our unique ad platform has enabled us to attract new strategic sponsors such as Pepsi, Coke and SAP last year. With these additions, we now have approximately 60 companies that spend over $1 million each year on the Live Nation platform driving over $200 million in revenue and additional 700 companies that also advertise on our platform generating over $300 million in sales revenue. We believe, we can continue to up-sell and convert these 700 sponsors as we grow our average deal size. Ticketmaster continue to build on its global leadership with the introduction of new products that instantly scale on Ticketmaster\u2019s platform and drive revenue. In 2014 these new products help drive a 7% increase in gross transaction value of primary tickets to $23 billion and a 55% increase in secondary GTV. Our most successful new product launch has been Ticketmaster Plus with over $1 billion of secondary GTV since its launch in the fall of 2013. The number of events activated in 2014 increased 500% to 10,000 events listed on Ticketmaster. Secondary growth for concerts in particular has been very strong with 350% year-on-year increase, demonstrating how Ticketmaster can leverage Live Nation concerts as a top customer to immediately establish scale and new products. And despite the strong growth, only 6% of our Ticketmaster event 2014 were activated with secondary inventory. So we have substantial run rate for growth ahead. At the same time we have shifted our product focus for event discovery, purchase and ticket management to mobile. As a result in the fourth quarter of 2014 for the first time, we have more visitors to our mobile sites than desktop. There remains tremendous growth opportunity for Ticketmaster traffic and conversion. The shift to mobile will more effectively link fans with shows and Ticketmaster\u2019s ability to drive mobile app installation as it continues to be the number one place to discover and buy tickets. Our commitment to our venue client is surprise them with the best service and products in the industry, and this continues to bare out as we achieved the net renewal rate of over 100% for the fifth straight year. In addition to enabling better products as a result of our technology investments we were also lowering our operating cost. And by the end of 2014, we reduced our cost per ticket in North America by almost $0.25 per ticket ahead of our planned time table. Demonstrating Ticketmaster's low cost business it had the second biggest sales day in its 30-year history last Friday selling over one million tickets. The top day four years ago and we expect this year to be like that. We\u2019re confident that our business model and it\u2019s scale provides ongoing growth potential during these continued opportunities to consolidate global concert business and we\u2019ll use that scale to start drive fan monetization, advertising, and ticketing. In 2012 we've grown revenue by 18% AOI by 20%, and cash flow by 31%. Looking forward to see this growth of sustainable and repeatable given the breadth of believers and friends working for us. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Joe, who will take you through additional detail. Joe Berchtold : Hey Michael. Looking first at our concerts business segment for the full year looking at the specific markets in North America attendance grew by 6% to our 40 million fans with show count of 2%, and attendance per show of 3%. While the amphitheaters, festivals and theaters and clubs all attracted more fans in 2014 stadiums were the strongest driver of fan growth with a record 76 stadium shows led by sellout tours with One Direction, Jay-Z, and Beyonce, Rihanna and Eminem. Internationally, attendance declined by 14%, which we believe was simply a matter of tour cycles and geographic mix with nothing to indicate any consumer issues. The attendance decline came from arenas and stadiums, which both experienced a substantial drop in show count. Notwithstanding the show count decline, our attendance per show at both arenas and stadiums was up for the year 1% and 7% respectively and globally our festivals continue to be a solid growth driver of 9% to almost five million fans. Looking at the fourth quarter, our results reflected a significant drop in arena shows and shift of activity to the third quarter that we previously indicated would be happening. If you look at the aggregate numbers we have 20% of our concerts revenue in Q4 this year versus 24% in each to the past two years. Again consistent with our previous projections of a shift in activity through the third quarter due to stadium activity and arenas timing. As a result we had 41% of our concert revenue in the third quarter of 2014 up from 37% or 38% in the past few years. As we look to 2015, our ticket sales so far this year remain on pace with last year and we expect the global touring pipeline to be at least as strong as it was in 2014 albeit with a return to a more traditional balance of stadium and arena shows. And in particular we expect our international markets to see material increase in touring activity. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business, our sponsorship and advertising business delivered 5% revenue and 10% AOI growth for the year closing with a very strong fourth quarter that grew AOI by 24%. As we look to 2015, through the end of January, we had double-digit growth and confirmed bookings for those sponsors and advertisers and as a result for 2015 we expect to continue delivering AOI growth at historical levels for the business. For the year, Ticketmaster revenue was up 11%, while AOI was up 9% and for the fourth quarter, our revenue was up 15% and AOI up 16%. In primary ticketing, Ticketmaster benefited from a further acceleration of concert on sales into Q4. As a point of comparison, 29% of total concert ticket sold at Ticketmaster in the year were sold in the fourth quarter of 2014 up from the more typical 26% to 27% for the past few years. In secondary ticketing we saw an acceleration of our GTV growth in the fourth quarter, driven particularly by the NFL concerts in our international markets. And as Michael noted, with our cost savings programs, we were able to drive our fourth quarter cost to achieve an almost $0.25 per ticket cumulative reduction in operating cost for our North America tickets. And through all this we continued our technology investments for future products, which we expect to be the norm for this business going forward. Based on ticket sales through the first six weeks of the year, in 2015 we expect to have low single-digit growth in primary tickets and ongoing double-digit growth in secondary ticketing. And as a result, we expect to continue the trajectory we\u2019ve been on with highest single-digit AOI growth in 2015. So in summary, as we look to 2015, we remain confident we will deliver our three-year plan as we\u2019ve laid out. A few points to note, first from a phasing standpoint we expect the third quarter to continue growing in its size as a percent of full year AOI. On the other hand, we expect that first quarter will return to generating its share of AOI more in line with what we saw in 2011 through 2013 as opposed to the spike we saw in Q1 last year. Secondly, on FX rate, given our 2015 was obviously set based on 2014 actuals, our revenue in AOI are both about two third U.S. dollar denominated and a one third mix of Euro, Pound, Canadian dollar and all other currencies in net order. In 2014 currency fluctuations did not have a major impact on our results about 1% of AOI. Part of the reason we haven\u2019t been impacted much is because we hedge our cost exposure against our revenue base. So our exposure is mainly in the value of profits we bring home from overseas, not in our actual cost of goods versus our revenue and obviously over the past few months, currency fluctuations have been much more volatile with risk of greater impacts in 2015. But at this point we feel very good about the underlying operating strength of the businesses around the world and see these fluctuations simply a cyclical point in time and not reflective of anything structural in the business. I'll turn the call over to Kathy now to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard : Thanks Joe and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by summarizing our key financial highlights for the year. Revenue was up 6% to $6.9 billion. AOI is up 10% to $555 million and free cash flow is up 9% to $327 million and in addition our concerts related deferred revenue at yearend is up 7% to $464 million. Now let me take you through some more other details. Revenue for the full year was $6.9 billion, up 6% over last year's $6.5 billion. All of our segments delivered revenue growth for the year, with the largest growth coming from concerts, up 5% and ticketing up 11%. Adjusted operating income in 2014 grew 10% to $555 million, compared to $505 million last year. Concerts AOI was $51 million, compared to $60 million in 2013, due to fewer stadium and arena shows internationally. Sponsorship and advertising's AOI grew 10% to $213 million from the higher online advertising and growth in sponsorship. Ticketing delivered AOI of $326 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year, due to increased primary and secondary ticket sales. And Artist Nation AOI was $48 million, a 50% growth from the $32 million in 2013, driven by higher management commission. Our overall AOI margin was 8% in line with 2013. Normalized operating income for the year was $161 million, an improvement of 7% over last year on the same basis even with the $38 million benefit in 2013 from the gain on disposal of assets and after deducting the non-cash accounting charges in 2014 largely coming from the goodwill write off of our international concerts business, our operating income for the year was $7 million. We delivered net income on a normalized basis for the year of $22 million compared to a net loss of $27 million for last year. This normalized net income equates to a positive EPS of $0.09 for 2014. After deducting the non-cash charges, net of the non-controlling interest share, our net loss for 2014 was $91 million and EPS was a loss of $0.49. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.6 billion, down 3% over last year, driven by an 11% drop in concerts revenue with a shift in activities in the third quarter this year as Joe netted. The rest of our operating divisions delivered double-digit growth in revenue for the quarter with the increase in ticketing revenue driven by higher primary and secondary ticketing volumes globally and the increase in sponsorship and advertising revenue coming from more online advertising deals. AOI for the quarter was up to $72 million. Concerts AOI was a loss of $67 million, compared to a loss of $40 million in 2013. The fourth quarter was impacted by fewer arena shows internationally along with the timing of our global touring activity. Ticketing AOI in the fourth quarter was $94 million, up 16% from last year's $81 million with the growth in primary and secondary ticket sales in both North America and Europe. Sponsorship and advertising's AOI for the fourth quarter was $50 million, up 24% from the prior year, coming from the increased arena activity. And Artist Nation AOI was $18 million, up 49% from last year with higher management commissions. In the fourth quarter, our normalized operating loss was $41 million in line with the fourth quarter of last year and after deducting the non-cash charges, our operating loss was $187 million. Lastly, our normalized net loss for the quarter was $81 million after deducting the same non-cash charges, net of the non-controlling interest share, our net loss for the quarter was $186 million. Moving on to cash flow, for the full year free cash flow was $327 million, a 9% increase over the $300 million last year. The increase for the year was due to our higher AOI, net of the increase in distributions to non-controlling interest. Our free cash flow as a percentage of AOI was 59% in 2014, in line with our targeted AOI conversion. Free cash flow was $19 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $17 million in 2013. Cash flow from operations was $269 million 2014, as compared to $417 million last year. The decrease year-over-year is primarily due to higher artist advances made towards the end of 2014 as we bought more 2015 tours supporting our growth and global market shares. As of December 31, we had total cash of $1.4 billion, which includes $534 million in ticketing client cash. Our free cash, which excludes the event related cash for future shows was $494 million as compared to $445 million in 2013. And as I noted, our deferred revenue per concerts was $464 million at the end of the year, an increase of 7% over the $434 million last year. Total capital expenditures for 2014 were in line with our expectations at $134 million of which $60 million was spend on maintenance items. Revenue generating capital expenditures totaled $74 million with higher investments in technology and development of innovative new products, along with an increase in venue related projects as compared to last year. Our total debt was $2.1 billion as of December 31, and our weighted average cost of debt, excluding debt discounts and including the debt premium is 4.3%. Our debt covenant requires a maximum leverage ratio of five times and we're comfortable in compliance of below four times at December 31. We\u2019re excited that we delivered another record year of operating results with growth in revenue AOI and free cash flow and we\u2019re looking forward to another strong year in 2015. Thank you for joining us for the call today. We\u2019ll now open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. David Joyce : Thank you. I was wondering if you can provide more color on the Ticketmaster savings that you're running ahead of schedule would you be at a run rate perhaps by the middle of this year or is that sort of going to be dependent on the phasing of the ticket sales goes this year? Joe Berchtold : Hey David, it\u2019s Joe. I think at this point we\u2019re just comfortable saying it\u2019s going to be -- we\u2019re going to get it out over the course of the year, not going to give you anything specific to the quarters, obviously as we get into the higher volume quarters it makes it all easier to get to that number. But we\u2019re sticking to over the course of the year. David Joyce : Thanks and I appreciate the help on sizing and thinking about the FX, but could you talk what the impact was on the concerts in the fourth quarter? Joe Berchtold : Oh yeah I gave you -- what I gave you was for the full year, it was about 1% of AOI almost all of that was fourth quarter impact and given that most of our revenues was in concerts you could assume that was a large driver. But again we hedge the input versus the output, so when we commit to an artist to do a tour in Europe, pay him in U.S. dollars, we hedge at that point to dollars again the revenue we get from the European ticket sales. So we\u2019re not just exposed again the revenue, most of it is a profit exposure if you will. David Joyce : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong : Thanks. Two questions just first on your guidance, when you talk about how the growth is sustainable and repeatable. Is this a 60 number or 60 number can you just help us think about kind of the growth CAGRs and elaborate on the guidance? And my second question is on acquisition for festivals. Anyway to think about the synergies either top or bottom line synergies with Austin City Limits and Lollapalooza. Thanks. Michael Rapino : Thanks Amy, on the guidance a few years ago, we had given a three-year plan and a target to get to our $600 million goal. And we're obviously in the last year of that three-year plan. We believe we\u2019re on track to deliver our goal. Obviously there\u2019s always inquiries about will you give further guidance beyond '16 or beyond '15, it's not something that we\u2019re going to get in a habit of, but I wanted to kind of give you kind of an overview there that if you look at what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish over the last three years, cumulatively regardless of exactly what year was up slightly versus the other. And you were trying to build a model '16, '17 and '18, our message there is to you getting from a $300 million-ish to $600 million was because we built a better business, we\u2019re investing in the right levers and we\u2019re monetizing it. And we do some tuck in acquisitions in every now and then a C3. So we can kind of repeat history going forward and we would expect to deliver if we were sitting here somewhere in the year 2019 and looking back over the last three years, our goal would be to continually deliver that kind of ongoing growth. And then on the festival question Amy, what we said is that when we buy a festival, our expectation is that it is going to be accretive to our business within the second size of our festivals after we buy -- so often when we buy a business, because the planning for the next festival are already well underway. There is a limited amount of impact which will impact it, but the limited amount again by the cycle after that we\u2019ll have our sponsorship team our ticketing organization, our operations team totally working alongside the acquisition to make sure that we\u2019re getting to that accretive level. Amy Yong : Great thanks and congrats on the year. Michael Rapino : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee. Vasily Karasyov : Thank you. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could give us a breakdown of the adjusted operating income growth in this sponsorship and advertising segment. What percentage of that is organic meaning it grew not from its positions, but what you had prior to the year start? And how dependent are you on continued acquisitions of festivals, promoters and so on in order to see this growth rate sustained into the future? Joe Berchtold : Our $300 million in advertising sponsorship revenue I don\u2019t know off the top 95% of that is organic. You have -- the scale that we already have when we do a bolt-on like C3 or we -- which is not in last year's numbers anyways. But when we do a bolt-on or addition, it\u2019s adding some incremental tickets and some incremental volumes on our quest to continually go from 5,000 shows to 22,000 shows to 30,000 shows. But our high margin advertising business has been growing at double-digits off its base organic business. Vasily Karasyov : And do you feel like you still have headroom to go in terms of growth there on organic basis that does that we\u2019re not monetizing it fully right now or you depend on growing attendance? Joe Berchtold : No we think we have if you do simple math and you say how big is the size of the price various reports will tell you that there\u2019s $18 billion, $20 billion spent corporate America on sports and music. So break that down and give you somewhere in a $1.5 billion to $2 billion spent in the music space. If you look at the size of our business and we\u2019re generating $300 million out of the $1.5 billion we know that we don\u2019t have to go compete against NBA or Sport. So our main line advertising just to get a bigger piece of that advertising space, but it is dedicated to music. A key function of that is we\u2019ve been doing very well over the last many net multiple years. And just to keep adding incremental ad units so staying out with the market. So nine years ago was a sign in amphitheater and then we elevated our staff and started selling strategic deals. And then we hired a digital team and started building an ad network and then last year we started monetizing our content and this year we started mobile advertising. So we think we got a 400% plus sales team so we got a group credible diverse set of skills there. They know how to sell content and how to sell digital and how to sell strategic and local and we think our assets are still undervalued and we will continue to be able to roll that high margin business as one of the core drivers of our business in terms of no capital required just monetizing the scale. Vasily Karasyov : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our final question from Martin Pyykkonen with Rosenblatt Securities. Martin Pyykkonen : Yeah, thanks couple of quick things, Joe you mentioned a few things in terms of outlook for the New Year, but I was wondering if you could kind of considering you have visibility obviously in the festivals you might buy and touring that things that haven\u2019t been announced obviously. Can you project any mix by venue Q2 and Q3 and Q3 in particular in that what extent that might vary from 2014 if at all and unless I missed it, I don\u2019t think there was any specific comments about the EDM segment, is that something you expect to be up this year in 2015 and any way you can scope any magnitude even if it\u2019s not on official number. Thanks. Michael Rapino : Yeah I\u2019ll give you kind of a general on the pipe, every year we always say that we have such scale that while I\u2019ll be sitting here in a year from now telling you that I had 22,000, 23,000 shows, yes. We have no fear that our global staff are the best at it. We\u2019ll continue to get our share of the market and slightly more. Last year, we had an exceptional in the U.S. only an exceptional stadium year. Had a lot of big stadium tours out last year. We don\u2019t see that repeating this year. But we\u2019re already seeing a much stronger arenas business this year, because the artist have decided maybe I\u2019m not going to go in stadiums, but I\u2019ll do longer U.S. states will come to life. I think you\u2019ll also see some artist debate whether with the FX cost and the cost of business that they do a few more shows in America versus traveling overseas. So we would look at the pipe it will be consistent from a show count, total ticket number year-over-year we see it still being given again it was a record year this year, which would be the record year the year before. So the benchmark continually gets higher, but we think we will repeat history. We think we\u2019ll have a strong arena market this year. We think festivals in Europe will be stronger this year than last year. And we think the EDM business, we have continually within Somiak taken a very disciplined approach to how we grow Electric Daisy to main festival in Vegas. We launched one last year in Mexico. We launched one in London. We\u2019ll continue to launch a few more of those on a global basis this year. And we continue to think EDM is a great channel and to be in the portfolio and it\u2019s providing some great advertising sponsorship opportunities as well as in 2015 the first year we\u2019ll officially move in Somiak all over to the Ticketmaster platform. So we start to get the double benefit of feeding the ticketing and advertising pipe. Martin Pyykkonen : So you characterized EDM just out of the words of your mouth, but the demand is still vibrant as far as the end market, I mean there\u2019s no concern from you sampling on that part and sounds like? Michael Rapino : No I would characterize it as I think it\u2019s a strong, stable, global business, but the reality of EDM is when you\u2019re not hitting mainline arena stadiums and festivals like country, rock and roll, pop and urban it's always going to be a small percent of our total business, because it\u2019s more about 10 great festivals of summer that matter versus 4,000 shows that happen across America that matter. So great small niche business, but given it operate kind of outside of the traditional venue platform, it allows to be more eventism and smaller to the total business. Martin Pyykkonen : I just had one quick question on ticketing, not so much again in number. But as you look at secondary ticketing revenue mix, I\u2019m assuming in your plans you would have that increasing as a percentage of mix over time. Should we be thinking of that as margin neutral or margin accretive or margin negative in terms of mix or secondary ticketing revenue relative to primary ticketing revenue over a multiple quarter few year time period? Michael Rapino : I would think of it as fairly margin neutral it\u2019s the same overall business concept is primary, which is we got some cost of acquiring rights that selling ticket season have service fees around the same 20%ish and you got operating cost against that to put you in low 20s kind of AOI rate. So there\u2019s nothing structurally different between primary in terms of the pipes of margin you should see. Martin Pyykkonen : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Michael Rapino : Thank you.",

The release, reconciliations and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Investor Relations tab on investors.livenationentertainment.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino : Thank you and welcome to our call. Live Nation has continued growing its business in 2015, with first quarter revenue up 4% on a constant currency basis, led by strong growth in our Ticketing business. More importantly, four months into the year, we now have enough data from leading indicators to be confident that we remain on track to deliver our 2015 plan, with continued top and bottom line growth, as we build global market share in our core Concerts, Advertising and Ticketing businesses. We have built the industry's most scalable and unparalleled live platform, bringing 400 million fans together to that magical two-hour event. Concerts remain a strong flywheel for our high-margin on-site, Advertising and Ticketing business. And this year, we expect to deliver record operating results by growing each of these businesses. Starting with our concerts business, we have now sold approximately half of our projected tickets for the year, and through April we are pacing 4% ahead of last year\u2019s ticket sales. We continue to be the world\u2019s leading promoter with approximately 20 of the top 25 global tours, including U2, Maroon 5, Luke Bryan and Ariana Grande. Along with attendance growth, we are also expecting to grow on-site revenue this year, as our sales initiatives focusing on the high-end fans continue to pay off. At the same time, we are expanding our global footprint, most recently, with the acquisition of the Bonnaroo Music Festival, which advances our position in the North American festival market. In 2012, we had none of the top five festivals, we now have four of the top five. Overall now, we have 68 festivals, with 5 million fans, making Live Nation the largest global festival producer. Given their strong appeal with fans and artists, we see festivals as an important high-margin growth channel on a global basis, providing the most cost effective platform for monetizing fans across advertising, on-site and Ticketing. And our Artist Nation division continues to attract new clients and continues to be a strong feeder to our core Concerts business. In Sponsorship & Advertising business, we again grew at a double-digit pace, with over 20% growth in both revenue and AOI this quarter on a constant currency basis. Contracted net revenue is up 17% at the end of the first quarter, and we have now sold over 70% of our planned advertising for the year, putting us ahead of schedule. This gives us confidence that we will continue growing our AOI in advertising at double-digit rates. Through the first part of the year, we have made great progress building our advertising scale and for the first time, comScore has ranked us as the third largest music focused advertiser network in the United States with over 60 million unique visitors a month. This firmly establishes Live Nation as one of the advertising platforms of choice in music, which we believe will now help accelerate our ad sales growth. Our content strategy is also advancing with the renewal of our Live Nation Channel on Yahoo! Live and also expanding into streaming of festivals on the channel. And we are on schedule to launch our Live Nation television channel with VICE later this summer.  We also refer to building our base of major advertising clients with a 10% increase in the number of companies that pay us over $1 million a year and a corresponding 18% expected increase in revenue from these clients. With all these pieces coming together, Live Nation is better positioned than ever to continue building its advertising business. Ticketmaster continued to build on its global leadership as a ticket marketplace this quarter, benefiting from product improvements and increased conversion rates as we increased our global share with a 14% growth in site visits, driving an 8% increase in combined primary and secondary Gross Transaction Value. As a result, during the quarter we had three of the top ticket sales base in Ticketmaster's history. We have deployed a number of mobile product enhancements during the quarter, improving the mobile responsiveness of our websites, increasing the functionality to buy, transfer, and resell tickets and enter venues with our apps. As a result, we are rapidly growing our mobile business, with a 20% increase in mobile visits and a 35% increase in mobile ticket sales. We are seeing rapid adoption of our mobile apps, up 43% from the first quarter over 2014 to over 17 million installs at the end of the first quarter this year. Looking ahead, we are optimistic that these trends will continue and accelerate as we improve our online mobile and API products to continue increasing the inventory of Ticketmaster's marketplace. In summary, 2015 is shaping up to be another year of growth and record results for the company, and we remain confident we will deliver the final year of our three-year plan. With strong leading indicators in Concerts, Advertising, and Ticketing, operationally we expect revenue and AOI growth in each of these businesses and overall for Live Nation this year. And more fundamentally, we continue to see a wide set of both organic and acquisition opportunities to continue growing each of our businesses beyond 2015, directly building on the success we achieved to date. With that, I'll pass it over to my COO, Joe Berchtold, who will take you through some of the divisional details. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, Concerts. Revenue for the quarter was flat on a constant currency basis and AOI was down due to a decline in attendance, which was expected coming off a high level of Q1 arena activity last year.  Given Q1 is traditionally our slowest quarter in Concerts, what matters most at this point of the year is our pipeline shows and ticket sold to date for shows occurring this year. Our show count for the full year is tracking towards mid-single-digit growth rate, led by double-digit growth in our arena shows. And as Michael said, ticket sales for shows occurring this year are up 4% through last Friday, setting us up for lower to mid single-digit growth in attendance this year. And based on these indicators, we expect to deliver double-digit AOI growth in Concerts for the year. At Artist Nation AOI fell in Q1, but this swing reflects the fluctuations and timing inherence in the business and we continue to expect solid performance through the rest of the year, keeping us largely in line with last year's results. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business, revenue of constant currency grew by 22% and AOI grew by 20% for the quarter. Online activity in North America was particularly strong, growing AOI 35% with major clients, including Pepsi, Hilton, Pennzoil, and Paramount Pictures. In our emerging markets, AOI more than doubled in the quarter, led by Thailand, Korea and Australia. And with this start to the year along with the growth in contracted net revenue, we are confident we will grow Sponsorship & Advertising AOI by double-digits this year. Finally, Ticketmaster, for the quarter Ticketmaster revenue at constant currency was up 11% and AOI was up 16%. Primary ticketing GTV was up 4% for the quarter led by strong concert ticket sales which drove double-digit growth in March. In secondary ticketing, we are now active in 13 countries. We increase the number of events activated on TM+ by 150% and as a result drove secondary GTV up by 75% for the quarter. Along with this ticketing growth, we continue to make progress on our cost reduction program and remain confident on our operating costs for North America ticket in 2015 will be at least $0.35 lower than it was in 2012. So based on ticket sales at this point in the year, we expect to have low single-digit growth in primary ticketing and double-digit growth in secondary ticketing in 2015. And with this ticketing volume, along with our cost reductions, we expect to deliver high single-digit AOI growth in Ticketing for the year. So, in summary, four months into the year, we feel very good about delivering 2015 on plan with regards to timing. Looking at Q2, we expect AOI performance as a percentage of full year AOI to be largely in line with 2014, which puts our overall AOI a bit more into the second half this year relative to last year. And finally, on FX impact during the first quarter, we saw revenue impacted by about 5% and AOI impacted by roughly 6%. I will now turn the call over to Kathy Willard to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard : Thanks, Joe and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin by summarizing our key financial highlights for the quarter. Revenue at constant currency is up 4% to $1.2 billion and flat as recorded at $1.1 billion. AOI is $73.9 million at constant currency and $69.6 million as recorded and free cash flow is $24 million. One of our most important leading financial indicators is our Concerts related deferred revenue, which is the monies we've received to date on tickets sold for events in feature at owned or operated venue. At the end of the first quarter, this deferred revenue was $919 million, an increase of 4% over the balance in March of last year of $885 million. Overall, revenue for the first quarter was driven by growth in Ticketing with both primary and secondary delivering strong results year-over-year. Concerts revenue was impacted in the quarter with the shift in arena activity as compared to last year as we discussed at year-end. The timing of concerts arena activity is also the main driver of our adjusted operating income results overall for the first quarter of 2015. As Concerts AOI for the quarter was a loss of $12 million compared to a $3 million loss for the same period last year. And as Joe noted, both our Ticketing and Sponsorship & Advertising businesses delivered higher AOI this quarter. During the first quarter of 2015, we reported an operating loss of $24 million compared to $12 million loss last year from our AOI results including the $4 million impact to foreign exchange rates declined this year. Net loss for the quarter was $58 million versus loss of $32 million last year, driven by a $21 million non-cash adjustment to certain working capital accounts, based on changes in the exchange rate. Free cash flow was $24 million this quarter compared to $35 million in the first quarter of 2014. This is due to our AOI results along with the $7 million increase in maintenance capital expenditures associated with point-of-sale enhancements to our venues and timing of other spend this year. Cash flow from operations was $343 million through March and was impacted by higher payments for event related expenses for shows later in the year as compared to last year. As of March 31, we had total cash of $1.6 billion, this includes $608 million in Ticketing client cash and $638 million in net concert event related cash, driven by our higher deferred revenue. Our free cash was $360 million. Our total capital expenditures for the first quarter were $26 million compared to $21 million last year. We spent $60 million on maintenance items and $10 million on revenue generating additions. We expect that our total capital expenditures for 2015 will be in line with the guidance we have previously given at approximately 2% of revenue. As of March 31st, our total current and long-term debt, including capital leases, was $2 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.3%. And our debt covenant currently requires a maximum leverage ratio of five times, and we're comfortably in compliance at below four times as of March. For the full year, we expect to drive growth operationally across each of our businesses in both revenue and AOI, while continuing to invest in our long-term growth strategies. In summary, we currently expect AOI for the second quarter to be consistent with last year as a percentage of full year AOI with more growth in 2015 coming in the second half of the year as Joe noted. We expect to deliver double-digit growth in Concerts AOI. The growth trend in Sponsorship & Advertising AOI is expected to continue and to deliver double-digit growth again in 2015. In Ticketing, we expect high single-digit AOI growth overall for the year. And Artist Nation AOI is anticipated to be in line with last year. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Amy Yong with Macquarie Capital. Amy Yong : Thanks. Congratulations. I have a really quick question just on the acquisitions that you've been making, and perhaps how we should think about their accretion going forward. So just thinking about C3 and Bonnaroo, and -- how should we think about the top and bottom line synergies on these two acquisitions alone? And I guess now that you have four of the five top brands in the U.S., should we expect more acquisitions internationally or perhaps other areas? If you could just help us think through kind of geographic expansion, that would be great. Michael Rapino : Thank you. This is Michael. Hi, Amy. In our investor presentations in the Liberty once in the fall time, I think now at least for the three years, we've always put up this kind of this global festival slide where we've shown the top 20 festivals in the European market and in America. And we've been pretty clear that festivals are a high margin, great channel to be in. We currently have always had a very strong presence in Europe, been the leader in festivals, T in the Park and Reading and Leeds and Lowlands of Holland and the list goes on. We're a little underdeveloped in America, probably because we focused a little too long on our amphitheaters. So, we over the last three years had a mission to make sure that we could fill that hole in an area where we have undeveloped market share. So, Insomniac, C3, a bunch of organic festivals in the country we started and now Bonnaroo. So, we look at the festivals from an acquisition perspective. They are a tough business to kind of organically get from zero to 80,000 people like Bonnaroo. You can waste a lot of money and fail a few times trying to get that magic in a bottle. So, we really look at the -- on a global basis, there is about 25, 30 festivals where they just become kind of iconic. Rock in Rio in Brazil, Fuji Festival in Fuji, and some of the ones we've acquired. So, we're always on the look on any of these marquee global festivals. If we think that buying that festival is a better return on capital, we've been trying to start two or three of them and making our way to that level. We know that buying these ones tend to be a better and shorter return on capital been trying to build them. Now for us we take an asset like Bonnaroo or Electric Daisy, once we plug that into our Ticketing platform, plug it into our Yahoo! platform like we just did with one of the C3 festivals and plug it into with our Advertising business, we've had great success taking those business and making them very accretive very fast and increasing AOI in those businesses by kind of bringing some scale and professional management and advertising to them and growing them at double-digit rates kind of another first couple years. So, we think we have a strong global portfolio. We will be opportunistic if we think there's other ones available that we can add to our platform. And if we think we can buy them and effectively add our synergies and make them instantly accretive acquisitions, we think those are good opportunities we will continue to pursue. But we would not be as kind of desperate as we were three years ago when we were sitting here with a very underdeveloped U.S. platform the sponsors and our Ticketmaster business were kind of yelling that we needed to get into. So, we're proud and happy with our current portfolio. And we find these very accretive acquisitions given that we get to scale them across our synergistic platforms. Amy Yong : Perfect. And then Joe, just thinking about Ticketmaster a little bit more, as you start gaining share on the secondary side and start reaping some of the cost savings, how do we think about longer term margins for that business? Joe Berchtold : Amy, sure. I mean, as we talked structurally and fundamentally, the secondary business has economics that are pretty consistent with the primary business. Obviously, when it's been a lower scale, it's been working its way back up toward primary. But in that same range, I would say is how you should think about the secondary business as it gets to a level of scale. Amy Yong : Got it. And on the cost savings side? Joe Berchtold : Sure. On a cost savings side, that's largely associated with our primary ticketing platform. So it's really those ticketing -- those tickets that the operating costs come out of. Amy Yong : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from John Janedis with Jefferies. John Janedis : Thank you. Can you guys talk a little bit more about sponsorships? Is the driver of growth digital, or is it much broader? And are you anywhere near having any kind of capacity issues? Michael Rapino : Thanks, John. Our businesses, at the end of the day has been an ad business that we continue to look at elevating our ad units. Originally, we were just an on-site kind of sponsorship business. If you were a major advertiser and you wanted to touch consumers on-site, we were kind of your best slot. Then we turned and built as our scale delivered outside of amphitheaters and more globally, we started to develop a commerce and digital business. So, at this current state, when we\u2019re talking to Madison Avenue, it\u2019s couple combinations. First and foremost, we\u2019re just a great now digital network to make an advertising buy-on, if you want to reach this demo with our scale. We have lots of inventory available still. We look at all of our assets and what is still available. And we have great runway ahead of us to continue to monetize a lot of unused ad units. A lot of the ad units are also a combination of on-site and digital, where most of our bigger deals our holistic programs where an advertiser is looking to launch a program, have a kind of a global or a large reach to our platform, but then really make it come to life like American Express does by delivering absolute direct value to access to concerts to their customer. So, we sell local, we sell regional, and we sell digital. We\u2019re seeing -- as everyone else is, we\u2019re very, very excited that our business is moving to mobile. We\u2019re keeping that audience and like everyone else, are looking at all ways that mobile advertising will continue to be a big part of our next new ad unit. So we see lots of inventory available. We have now the reach on-site of over the 60 million customers that advertisers want to be associated with. And now with the 60 million plus on a digital basis, we are able to sale local sponsorship, national access and digital reach programs with capacity left on all of those. John Janedis : Thanks. And maybe separately, you touched on mobile. I was hoping to dig a little deeper in terms of the mobile app. How many more shows do app users attend compared to non-app users? And over time, can we see much of a margin benefit as a result? Joe Berchtold : So, John, this is Joe. We haven\u2019t released any details on the specific segments for folks that we have in terms of how they do their purchasing. So I can\u2019t get into that right now. On the economics -- our economics are the same whether somebody buys online or via app, both of those are obviously lower cost than more direct methods of sale. But our economics are the same, service fees are the same, margins are the same. John Janedis : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question comes from John Tinker with Maxim Group. John Tinker : Thanks. Two brief questions. One, could you just touch on Artist Nation and the increase in SG&A? So that was the negative comp, and talk about that a little. And, secondly, in the fast moving world of music streaming, can you just give us your views on where that\u2019s going and how you\u2019re involved because you still have a relationship with Jay Z, but he\u2019s buying Tidal, and exactly how you fit into that? Michael Rapino : You\u2019re good, Tinker. Yeah, we will stick to our knitting right now. We support Jay and all of our artists and any of their endeavors. And we will do everything we can to help Jay succeed and those artists. But we think we have a great runway ahead of us just doing exactly what our core business is. On a global basis, we have lots of opportunities to scale and continue to grow our concert business, new ticket markets, new ticket products, and then later on the advertising on top of that. So we think that our best strategy is to use our resources to keep right down the fairway, continue to consolidate and organically grow our core business. And we will leave the streaming hardware to others right now, and we'll worry about selling concert tickets.  One of the advantages of Ticketmaster and our new platform we've been working on, obviously, Ticketmaster Plus was the first new product that we were able to introduce having a more robust platform. But we do also look at a lot of these opportunities with Apple and others that we now have a platform with an API and an ability to distribute a buy button. So we look at some of these streaming sites just as great distribution outlets that we currently will either have an affiliate or a buy button strategy to increase our reach and increase our conversion, but not a core business that we would be looking to tackle at this point. A \u2013 Kathy Willard : And John, on your first question on Artist Nation SG&A, that's really driven by the fact that we've been adding some key managers to the business, and so it's just timing of those costs coming in versus when the artist -- the activity is coming in from the artist in terms of commission. Q \u2013 John Tinker : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. Q \u2013 David Joyce : Thank you. I was wondering on the sponsorship front, what portion is strategic at this point, meaning revenue that\u2019s likely straight line versus event correlated, and how should we think about that trending as you expand your platform globally? A \u2013 Joe Berchtold : So, David, this is Joe. We talked at the end of year that roughly $200 million in revenue was coming from our largest relationships, which meant over $1 million per year in revenue from those relationships. Those relationships generally now withstand the gamut. As Michael was talking, as we take the combination of the 60 million fans that go to our shows and the 60 million unique, so most of those folks are doing a combination of digital and traditional sponsorship. I think you can take from the magnitude of those relationships. There is some steadiness to them, but, certainly, it's not all contracted revenue with those folks. Q \u2013 David Joyce : Thanks. And on the Ticketing front, how much of -- the margins were better than we thought this quarter, how much of that is due to the replatforming expense saving may be happening a little sooner than your year-end plan versus just your volumes increasing, so some of good operational leverage. A \u2013 Joe Berchtold : Yes, it was exactly both of those things, David. As I alluded to, we had a very good March, a little better than we were sitting here talking to you at the end of February than we knew it was going to be. So there was some volume pick up their relative to expectation, and, yes, we are doing great on getting the cost savings and that's in part why we are confident. We'll have it fully in place this year. Q \u2013 David Joyce : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ben Mogil with Stifel. Q \u2013 Benjamin Mogil : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow up on Amy's question, and Michael, you were talking about the festival business, and your comment that you can burn through a lot of money trying to get a festival started, and we've certainly seen that. When you look at festivals you've bought and when you look at festival business, in general, there's been some high-profile expansions where people went to a second weekend and that didn't work out or people took a festival that was in city A and moved it to city B and that didn't work out. Generally speaking, are you finding that people are too ambitious about their festival expansion? Are you finding that some festivals are one weekend is good enough? Curious your views on how scalable some festivals are? A \u2013 Michael Rapino : There is no one right answer here. I mean, Festivals range small city one up to big ones and they may look easy to replicate and grow, but it's not that simple. We look at Festivals at the end of the day, there are hundreds of little Festivals happening at all times that are generally a labor of love, not generally much of a real business. Our business at the end of the day on a global basis is we like those Festivals with scale, 30,000 plus. Obviously, because then they become truly advertising units and also most of where the talent leverage we have is on that end. So, you know, I think if anything, lots of people out there as Festival producers, very few make it to the top of the Bonnaroo, C3, Coachella, Insomniac level. And we think those are the ones that we want to be participating in and provide us the best return on our capital. And we generally don't look to launch and take a lot of risk every year on launching a lot of them. We organically launched three or four every year in a very structure risk adverse manner. Seeing if we can self brew some of them. But at this point, it's an expensive game to scale from scratch. And given we already own 60 for many years in our European platform, adding on a few quality high-profile ones in our U.S. platform was just kind of a continuation of a long strategy we started in Europe. I would not want to be sitting here today trying to figure out how to buy and/or build 60 festivals with over 5 million customers. That would be a very expensive proposition. Q \u2013 Benjamin Mogil : And going through the C3 deal and the Bonnaroo deal, do you see the M&A environment, because of the changes with AEG and what SFX is going through, its privatization, do you see the environment as a buyer, better, if you will? A \u2013 Michael Rapino : You know, I think with built a fairly unique global business at this point. We tend not to chase deals. We tend whether it's a management company or in the case of Superfly and I think their comments they mentioned this week to the press. We tend to believe we are a place where an entrepreneur who maybe has already had some success. When looking at the scale that we can bring to their resources can take Bonnaroo, C3 or Insomniac to new levels, we kind of think we're in a unique class in that point. So whether it was Insomniac or C-3 or Bonnaroo, I would I don\u2019t think in any case if there was much of a bidding war. I think others were interested, but I think those founders believe that we probably could provide the best opportunity to grow their businesses and using our assets. Q \u2013 Benjamin Mogil : That's great, Michael. Thanks for the color. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our final question today from Rich Tullo with Albert Fried & Company. Q \u2013 Rich Tullo : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Nice quarter. My question is, what percentage or if you could provide a little color on the ads and sponsorships, is derived from the website and content deals versus what we would call traditional, if that exists, sponsorship in the concert business? And just a little follow-up on the VICE TV, is that a YouTube channel or a traditional cable TV channel? A \u2013 Joe Berchtold : So, Rich, this is Joe. On the sponsorship versus online, we talked at the end of last year on those numbers, it was roughly two-thirds, call it, sponsorship, traditional delivery, and about one-third of it was online, to give you the general mix. And in terms of the VICE Channel, we have not -- we haven't announced exactly how that Channel will be distributed, so those announcements will be coming up over the next month or so and it will be launched this summer. Q \u2013 Rich Tullo : And is there any way to provide a little color on the growth of the online product versus anything else, because I would suspect that, that is growing, excluding the lift from sponsorships, is growing quite fast? A \u2013 Joe Berchtold : Yeah. No, I gave you my numbers that North America online was up about 35% AOI. So, yes, online is growing strongly. As Michael said, we've also built a network of over 60 million unique, and that brings us into a whole another class with Madison Avenue and top three music related sites. So we absolutely expect some good portion of our growth will be driven by the online this year. Q \u2013 Rich Tullo : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Live Nation has continued growing in the second quarter and for the first half, with revenue up 12% and AOI up 6% on a constant currency basis in the second quarter. The increase in revenue was led by our concerts business as we continue attracting more fans to more shows globally, which in turn drives AOI growth in our advertising and ticketing businesses through first half of the year. With the majority of our tickets sold for the year, we are confident that we remain on track to deliver our 2015 plan, and all key leading indicators reinforce our expectations of continued top and bottom-line growth as we build global market share in our core concerts, advertising and ticketing businesses. We have built the industry's most scalable and unparalleled live platform, bringing 450 million fans in 40 countries to that magical two-hour event each year. Concerts are the flywheel for our high-margin on-site, advertising and ticketing businesses and this year we expect to deliver record operating results, increasing revenue and profitability for each of these businesses. Starting with the concerts business, we have now sold approximately 75% of our projected tickets for the year, and through July we are pacing 7% ahead of last year's ticket sales. This is our top leading indicator that we will increase concert attendance again this year. We continue to be the world's leading promoter for about three-quarters of the top 25 tours, including U2, Imagine Dragons, Luke Bryan, Kid Rock and One Direction. The strength of our global platform continues to deliver growth as we have increased year-on-year attendance. In the second quarter over a million more fans attended our shows. For the full year we expect to grow our fan base by over two million fans, which on its own would be one of the top five promoters in the world. Along with attendance growth, we have also grown per-fan on-site revenue this year by 18% to over $20 per fan in our amphitheaters and festivals as our new sales initiatives, particularly those focused on the high-end fans is paying off. At the same time, we continue building our global platform for the future, most recently adding Marek Lieberberg to establish our concerts business in Germany. Germany is one of the top three concert markets in the world and Marek has a history of promoting more than 700 shows for over two million fans each year. Adding these shows to Live Nation can make us the top promoter in Germany, and moving those two million tickets to the Ticketmaster platform in Germany will substantially increase our scale and market position and ticketing in Germany. With this move, Live Nation now has a promoting presence in all major Western European markets, along with our presence now in nine Asian markets, we are the only promoter able to provide global and regional touring support at scale for artists. Our artist managers continue to provide a strong pipeline of shows to our concerts and sponsorship division. In the sponsorship & advertising business, we have delivered strong growth through the first half, with both revenue and AOI up over 20% on a constant currency basis. Our key leading indicator for advertising, contracted net revenue is up 19% on a constant currency basis as of the end of the second quarter and we have sold 80% of our planned sponsorship for the year. This now gives us confidence that our AOI growth rate in sponsorship & advertising for the year will be in the low teens, an acceleration from recent years. Our online advertising continues to build rapidly, growing revenue by 36% and AOI by over 30% at constant currency for the first half. We now have over 65 million unique monthly visitors to our sites and broader network, making Live Nation one of the top three online music networks. On the content side, we have entered the second year of streaming live shows with Yahoo! Live, with an increased focus on festivals this year, including EDC in Vegas, Wireless and Creamfields in UK and Voodoo in New Orleans. Our Live Nation TV channel with VICE Media is launching this month in beta and to provide live music fans and advertisers a channel dedicated to live music content, delivered by VICE's unique story-telling ability. With the growth of our Festival businesses we are also continuing to build our base of major advertisers, increasing the number of companies that pay us over $1 million a year by 15%, now delivering a collective $200 million to Live Nation in 2015. With all parts of our advertising business now performing and growing rapidly, we expect a record level of AOI growth in 2015, with continued strong runway. Ticketmaster has continued building its global leadership as a ticketing marketplace this year, with 7% growth in traffic leading to a 10% increase in primary and secondary GTV. A key driver behind this growth in site visits and GTV has been our mobile first strategy, building our products for ease of use and viewing on mobile devices. Mobile now consistently accounts for more than half of our traffic, both in North America and internationally. And year-to-date we have deployed 27 updates to our apps globally as we are enhancing the fan experience. As a result, we continue seeing growth in mobile ticket sales, up 21% through the first half, and now accounting for 21% of all ticket sales. Our app install base continues to build as well, now at 19 million, as more fans are seeing the benefit from improved search and ticket management functionality. I am confident that 2015 will mark the true point of conversion of Ticketmaster to a technology company. We have the right leadership and technology teams in place, building a marketplace and delivering products with great fan features while also capturing cost savings for the business. With all this, Ticketmaster has never been better positioned. After growing the business in the first half of the year, we expect 2015 to be another year of growth and record results for the company and we are confident that we will deliver the final year of our three-year plan. Based on the strong position of our leading indicators in concerts and advertising and ticketing, operationally we expect revenue and AOI growth in each of these businesses and overall for Live Nation this year. And more fundamentally, we continue to see a wide set of both organic and acquisition opportunities to further grow each of these businesses beyond 2015, directly building on the success we have achieved to-date. With that, I will turn it over to Joe Berchtold, our COO, for more details. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. Live Nation Concerts revenue in the second quarter was up 14% and AOI was up 9% on a constant currency basis. The revenue growth was driven by a 7% increase in attendance at our shows for the quarter, led by our festivals and arenas. Festival attendance was up 77% for the quarter to over two million fans as we increased the number of festivals in the quarter from 18 to 23 and had some activities shift into Q2 from the third quarter. Arena attendance was up 35% to over five million fans at 600 shows, up from approximately 450 shows in 2014. Looking forward to the second half, we're confident that we will deliver mid-single digit attendance growth and double-digit AOI growth at constant currency for the year. As Michael said, ticket sales for shows this year are up 7% through July, and our pipeline of shows in the second half, particularly the fourth quarter, is very strong and we expect to increase our show volume to about 24,000 this year. At Artist Nation, our Artist Management business, AOI fell in Q2 as we invested to launch new service lines. For the second half, we expect the business to perform more in line with the second half of last year, with timing weighed more to the fourth quarter. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business. Revenue for the second quarter grew by 20% and AOI was up by 23% at constant currency, continuing its strong performance from the first quarter. Online advertising was particularly strong, with overall AOI growing 29% at constant currency as we continue to benefit from the structural shift towards digital advertising, particularly advertising targeting millennial audiences. Looking at our different markets, European online grew by about 55% and North America was up about 20%. Sponsorship revenue was up 22% for the quarter at constant currency, with both North America and Europe up consistently and Asia now contributing a material impact on our growth. With over $250 million in sponsorship and advertising now contracted for the year, we're confident enough to increase our expectations for the full year to low-teens AOI growth at constant currency. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster revenue was up 2% and AOI was flat as global GTV increased 6%, all at constant currency. Primary GTV for the quarter was up 4%, with a slight decrease in tickets sold. Recognized ticket fees were negatively impacted by the increase in deferred ticket sales for Live Nation Concerts as seen in our 20% year-on-year increase in event-related deferred revenue, up to over $1 billion. Given the flow-through of these deferred tickets along with the expected on sales, we continue to expect low-single digit growth in primary ticket volume and mid-single digit growth in primary GTV for the year. Secondary GTV was up 38% for the quarter, as we continue to see the success in our strategy of aligning with content and providing fans their full set of choices with transparency. As a result, we are seeing conversion rates on integrated inventory events 30% higher than those with primary-only options. And our volume of events with integrated inventory continues to grow, up another 29% for the quarter. We expect secondary GTV to continue delivering strong growth for the rest of the year, with almost two-thirds of our volume in the second half and the fourth quarter being our largest quarter, given the combination of NFL, NHL and NBA games along with our concert on sales. In addition to this ticketing growth, we have now taken the steps necessary to reduce our cost base and deliver our North American tickets at a cost per ticket that is $0.35 lower than it was in 2012. Overall, based on our ticketing GTV projections combined with cost reductions, we continue to expect to deliver high single-digit AOI growth in ticketing at constant currency for 2015. In summary, now more than halfway through the year, we are confident we will deliver 2015 on plan. With regards to FX, we saw similar results in the second quarter as the first, with revenue impacted by 5% and AOI impacted by about 6%. On timing, we expect Q3 to be largely in line with last year and a strong Q4 across our businesses. Our concerts pipeline for the fourth quarter is quite strong, both in attendance and show count, including tours by Madonna and Janet Jackson in the United States, Maroon 5 in Asia, and U2 in Europe. And as a result, sponsorship & advertising growth looks very solid in the fourth quarter as well. And as we noted with ticketing, our secondary business is seasonably strong in the fourth quarter, and this along with expected on sales for 2016 concerts, makes us confident on the remainder of the year. I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Joe. I will start with our results for the second quarter. Revenue at constant currency is $1.9 billion, up 12% from the same period in 2014. Reported revenue is $1.8 billion. AOI is $151 million at constant currency, up 6% over last year. Reported AOI is $142 million. And free cash flow is $91 million, up 10% compared to last year. At the end of June, our concerts-related deferred revenue, which is the monies we've received to date on tickets sold for events in the future at our owned or operated venues was $1 billion, an increase of 20% over the balance in June of last year of $858 million. Revenue growth for the quarter over last year was driven by higher concerts revenue from increased arena activity in North America and higher festival activity. Reported AOI for the second quarter was in line with last year at $142 million. Total FX impact to AOI for the second quarter was $9 million. Our sponsorship & advertising segment's AOI was up 23% at constant currency, with higher online advertising activity in festival sponsorship. Ticketing AOI was slightly down, with the shift in timing of ticket sales to the first quarter. Concerts AOI was flat to last year, and Artist Nation's AOI was lower as we invested in new service lines. Our operating income for the quarter was $42 million compared with $56 million last year due to higher amortization, primarily related to acquisitions. Net income this quarter was $15 million versus $23 million in 2014, driven by the lower operating income. Free cash flow in the second quarter is $91 million versus $83 million in 2014, driven by timing of interest and tax payments as well as lower distributions to noncontrolling interest partners. Turning to the results for the first half of the year. Revenue at constant currency is up 9% from last year to $3 billion. Reported revenue is $2.9 billion, up 3%. AOI is $225 million at constant currency, in line with last year. And reported AOI is $211 million. And free cash flow is $115 million. Revenue for the first six months was driven by growth in concerts, which delivered over half of the overall increase, up from higher North American arena activity and increased festival activity globally. All of our business segments had higher revenue over last year in the first six months. AOI for the six months was $211 million, as reported. Total FX impact to AOI for the first half was $14 million. Sponsorship & advertising AOI grew 23% at constant currency, with higher online advertising in festival sponsorship. Ticketing AOI was up 7% at constant currency from higher resale ticket sales, and increased primary ticket volume, primarily from concerts. Concerts AOI was impacted by the timing of the mix of shows year-to-date. As Joe noted, we expect higher activity for concerts in the back half of this year as indicated by the 20% increase in deferred revenue. Lastly, Artist Nation's AOI was lower with the investments we're making in additional service line. Operating income was $18 million for the six months compared to $43 million last year due to lower AOI along with higher amortization related to acquisitions. Our net loss in the first six months was $43 million, which was impacted by a $20 million non-cash adjustment to a certain working capital account due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Our normalized net loss excluding that was $23 million compared to a loss of $10 million last year. Free cash flow for the six months is $115 million, in line with last year. Our cash flow from operations was $357 million for the first six months and was up year-over-year, largely because of the increase in deferred revenue. As of June 30, we had cash of $1.5 billion, including $618 million in ticketing client cash and $707 million in net concert event-related cash with a free cash balance of $201 million. Our total capital expenditures year-to-date were $64 million with about a 50% split between maintenance and revenue-generating CapEx. For the full year, we expect that our total capital expenditures will be in line with our previous guidance at around 2% of revenue. As of June 30, our total debt, including capital leases, was $2 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt is 4.3%. Our debt covenant currently requires a maximum leverage ratio of 5 times, and we are comfortably in compliance at below 4 times as of June. We continue to expect that we will deliver on our three-year plan for 2015, with growth in both revenue and AOI on a constant currency basis while we continue to invest in our long-term growth strategies. In summary and all based on constant currency, overall we currently expect AOI for the third quarter to be largely in line with last year, along with a strong fourth quarter across our businesses. We continue to expect double-digit growth in concerts AOI for the year, with increased show activity in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. We expect growth in Sponsorship & Advertising AOI to be in the low teens with the majority of the second half growth driven by a strong fourth quarter. With the projected strength of both primary and resale ticket sales, especially in the fourth quarter, we expect that ticketing will deliver high-single digit AOI growth for the year. And for Artist Nation, we expect AOI for the last half of the year to be more in line with the second half of last year, also more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. Thank you for joining us today. And we will now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you and congrats on the quarter. My first question is actually on the concert side. You made several acquisitions and I think in general they're accretive within two and a half years. Can you help us frame the financial impact of your deal with Marek Lieberberg? And now that you're wrapping up your acquisitions in Concerts, C3, Bonnaroo, what other festivals or regions could you expand into? And any thoughts on your latest output agreement with Time for Fun? Thank you. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Hey, Amy. It's Joe. Sure, let me try to take those in order. First of all, just looking at the deal with Marek, as we said, Marek has a history of doing over 700 shows and over 2 million fans. So added to our roughly 60 million fans that we have, it's a sizable addition. He's one of the top handful of promoters in the world on a stand-alone basis. So we think it's important both on a stand-alone basis and you can do the math and see the level that it will help increase across our business. But also as importantly, it really rounds out our European Asian market portfolio that lets us do regional and global tours more effectively for artists. So we think it's a key piece to accelerating that overall side of the business. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And let's just note, on MLK, in Germany to-date we basically have Ticketmaster Germany. Because it's an allocated market, we don't have a lot of activity. And generally in Germany overall Live Nation, Ticketmaster is about a negative to a zero business. Adding now this acquisition, which will be accretive day one because of the low cost we were able to attract Marek to come into the network, we get to start that machine now where we've already got a fixed cost base of TM Germany in place. We get to now allocate tickets to our own platform. Historically, when we brought a Madonna and a U2 into Germany, we sold those off to Marek or someone else. Now we get to self-promote. And then once you start self-promoting with tickets, you start to expand your sponsorship base. So we're very, very proud about this deal. We've been working on it a long time. And, Andre, his son, and Marek provide us an instant base business in Germany to build our TM+ \u2013 TM business as well as our sponsorship and concerts and grow it from day one. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : And then, Amy, as the second question on what other festivals and regions. As you know, we look at all of this globally, now in more than 40 countries. So we'll continue to look at festivals in Asia and Latin America. As we've also talked broadly, Latin America continues to be a great opportunity. The U.S. as well. We still think that there remain opportunities for us to both build organically and potentially look at additional acquisitions here. So our global market share in concerts we think is in the 30% range and so we globally see great opportunities to continue to expand on that. And then further to your other Latin America question, yes, our output deal with Time for Fun is ending this year. And we are looking extensively at the full set of options we have to further our presence in that market. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. And if I could just... Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say that just a \u2013 Amy, to add one thing to Joe's comment, our output deal for T4Fun as well as CIE in Mexico have ended this year. So historically, much like the Marek Lieberberg conversation, we sold off our U2 shows and et cetera to either CIE in Mexico and T4Fun in Brazil. We have not renewed either of those deals nor plan on renewing those. We plan on taking our content and establishing a presence in those markets, so again we can start building our ticket, sponsorship and overall business off our content. So whether we do that through an acquisition or a startup, we're exploring all those options. But getting kind of from Canada going down to Mexico into South America, it's obviously a natural routing for the 50-plus tours we buy, so important markets for us to finish the play on, given we're spending lots of content. So... Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. And then on the ticketing side, you've made several key hires. What kind of tangible benefit should we expect now that you've achieved $0.35 in cost savings? And how's competition with StubHub been trending? Thank you. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : So we don't know how StubHub is doing, so hard to comment specifically on that. I think we've given you a lot of statistics about the growth of our share in the secondary business and our GTV in the secondary business. So we're feeling very good about our product, our service that we're offering to fans and the strength of that in the marketplace. So we have high expectations on continued success and growth in the secondary market. In terms of the ticketing business more broadly, as Michael's talked, our number one focus is continuing to expand that globally with what we're doing in Germany, with what we look to do in Latin America, and continue to scale that business is a key way that we're monetizing our concerts business. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And on Ticketmaster, Amy, we think we just have a ton of runway there. We have a top five global commerce site. Has not historically been anywhere near best-in-class in terms of converting all of that traffic, so a lot of the hires you'll see \u2013 we're always going to be centered around our two core missions : a better product and conversion. So whether it's one of our new hires from Virgin Airways who's going to focus around our loyalty and converting that base, or some of the great product people we've hired who are going to continually deliver a more seamless product on our mobile app and our mobile business. So the tangible benefit is I think what we're seeing on a quarterly basis : traffic up, conversion up, GTV up. To get all of those up, we know that we got to deliver a better product ongoing with the robust roadmap. I think we mentioned today that we had 27 updates to our mobile app, so we're very serious about having a best-in-class mobile experience from the minute you find out about that show to the digital ecosystem throughout. And we got to make sure that our conversion gets better and better as that massive traffic's coming through our door through mobile or on desktop, we want to make sure we know more about you. We've talked a lot about our sales force and our CRM strategy, really mining that data of all those customers that have either come before or are new to our site, offering them a better experience and ultimately converting them over time. So a lot of the hires or anything you see we do is all geared toward either better product and ultimately higher conversion against a very high traffic base that we currently have and the tangible benefits we'll see on continual GTV and traffic usage. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI : Thank you. A few clarifications, please. I was just wondering how long it would take for Marek Lieberberg to get up to that 700 show kind of run rate? And secondly, free cash dipped sequentially, I was wondering how much of that was due to acquisitions like Bonnaroo or anything else you could talk to and anything else that would have impacted that? Thanks. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So in terms of MLK getting up to speed, we expect it to be pretty quick. We announced it mid-year so that we made sure that as we're thinking about our tours that we're lining up for next year, that we're taking that into account that we'll have a German position to self-promote. That will obviously focus on the biggest stadium/arena-type shows, so I think we'll very quickly in the next year drive the bulk of that fan base. And then again he's up and running January 1, and the smaller shows tend to have a shorter lead time. So we would expect vast, vast mass majority of that hitting next year and then fully up to speed by 2017. Kathy Willard - Chief Financial Officer : And then, David, on the free cash question, it's driven by acquisitions at about $60 million, and then the other big driver that is just continued advances for those artists and ticketing clients as we continue to grow the future of the business. David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI : Thanks. And on the strong online advertising growth, how can you help us think about how much the Yahoo!'s streaming of live shows has contributed to that? Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : I think on a year-on-year basis, that's not a substantial growth contributor, given the timing of when the show started. David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI : Okay. And how much longer do you have with the Yahoo! contract? Is that something that could be up for better economics, anything you can talk about there? Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we will continue to renew that on an annual basis, and as you can see this year, we were able to expand our content offering by increasing our festival presence. And I think by this point now, we have attracted a good audience and proof of concept that would let you know that there are many other advertisers or streaming platforms that are interested and excited about these opportunities still. We'll remain with Yahoo! as long as the economics work for both of us and we think this is a viable business going forward. David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI : Thanks. And just one final question, if there's any update on when you'll be able to roll off the old Ticketmaster systems post-replatforming. Thank you. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, David, as we've talked about over the past year or so, the way that the evolution is working is on a modular basis. So we're replacing substantial portions of the system as we go along. I think that by certainly end of the year, you'll see again the vast, vast majority of the underlying technology, particularly on our Concerts business, has been replaced. A lot of it's not going to be visible to you, the consumer, because it's the back office plumbing. David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Janedis at Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thank you. I think there's a lot of interest in the VICE channel. Can you help us frame the upfront investment? Are you assuming an impact on digital advertising in the outlook? And over the long term, will that change the margin trajectory in the segment? Thank you. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right, I'll try to step back. So let's get back to the strategy. As we've outlined, our first job over the last couple years was to consolidate and build our global platform from a digital basis. So now with over 65 million uniques on a digital basis, we have a wide platform. Obviously like anyone else in digital advertising, the advertisers are looking for more and more sticky content that we could create to satisfy their needs. Yahoo! was our first toe in the water to validate that we could deliver that. And now VICE will be that next evolution, where we'll launch a start-up channel, we'll have lots of content, original programming, all based around the Live Music business. And we think it's absolutely all incremental new advertising to our platform. It'll be a new channel. We'll have multiple distribution points. And as we get the combination of the content right with the distribution right, we just think it's all incremental eyeballs and advertising to our current base business. John, does that give you a good basis? John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Yeah, that does. Thanks. But just in terms of \u2013 I'm just thinking about the model. Anything upfront we should be thinking? Meaning is this a single-digit million kind of investment? Is it low-double? Is there anything you can help there? It would be useful I think for modeling. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we hope to because it's an \u2013 we assume like the Yahoo! Model, the investment ultimately gets recouped within that same year by the advertisers. So Yahoo! was a multi-million dollar investment to stage all those shows annually and we've been able with Yahoo! to deliver a profit against that business. We look at VICE in a similar fashion. There's a start-up cost to create some new content, but we believe that through distribution once we get rolling over the next six months and the eyeballs are delivered, that we'll be netting ourselves incremental AOI, advertising and digital next year from this. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Arthur at Huber Research. Please go ahead. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. I guess three questions. Question one, I'm not quite used to such a big emphasis on the fourth quarter to make the year numbers. I get the Ticketmaster timing thing. But what are you seeing in the concert business for the third quarter that gives you a little pause? The second question, international attendance. It was down a fair amount in 2014 but the events were down. Now the events are up, but the attendance is still down. Is that just mix? If you could clarify that. And then, Kathy, on your statement about Artist Nation in the second half, are you saying in line with last year results or in line with the growth of last year's results? Thanks. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : So, Doug, this is Joe. Let me take those. So first of all, there's nothing giving us pause on Q3. I don't think we've said that. What we said is that our line-up for Q4, on a Q4 to Q4 basis, is particularly strong. I gave you some examples of the shows that we have. It just so happens that from a timing of touring perspective, this year our show counts and our expectations for attendance in Q4 are quite strong. As we said our tickets sold for shows occurring this year is up 7% for the year, so that gives us a strong underlying level of confidence in where we end up strongly with growth in global attendance at our shows, so just trying to give you the timing of that Q3 to Q4 where a lot of that is coming from that we're seeing. In terms of the specifics on the international side, yes it's simply a type of show mix that we have, fewer stadium shows this year but a very strong arena and festival line-up, so you're just seeing some show mix there. But again globally our expectations are both North America and international, fan growth for the full year. You're obviously also seeing the impact coming out of Europe of FX at the percentages that I told you. And then specifically as it relates to Artist Nation, the comment was that for the second half that the overall results are more in line with what the overall results were last year for the second half. We've been investing in scaling that business, adding some new service lines. As we've often talked about for our Artist Nation business, the most critical aspect of it is that it's aligned with and feeds our concerts and sponsorship business that drives the scale that we have there. We've had great success in terms of building our share and show count with all of the artists in Artist Nation because of the value that we're delivering for them from the core businesses, so our focus is very highly on building that business in an alignment with the rest of the businesses, so just trying to give you some specifics on where we think that's going in the second half. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment second quarter 2015 earnings conference call.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2015 conference call. Live Nation had a record third quarter and remains on track to deliver its planned growth and record performance in 2015. Our key financial metrics are up for the quarter with revenue growing 10% and AOI up 8%, both at constant currency. Our operating metrics reinforce the strength of our business with 10% increase in fans attending our concerts in the quarter, driving strong growth in our advertising and ticketing business. This demonstrates that Live Nation has created an unparalleled live platform, bringing over 500 million fans in nearly 40 countries to that magical live event. The live business continues to have a robust outlook as artists are now fully reliant on touring as a main earnings driver and the best means to engage and connect with their fan base. And fans more than ever rate live experiences from club shows to festivals as one of the top entertainment sources and a majority of those attendees are sharing that event online, making event some of the most shared activities in social media, resulting in awareness growing for our event. At Live Nation, we see a great runway still ahead given the fragmented global landscape in concert, management and ticketing. And as our scale continues to grow, we will drive increasing economics in our business model with higher profits per show, more advertising and increased ticket conversion. In our concert division, the concert fan demand remained strong globally and we're continuing to grow by taking share promoting of the 20 of the top the 25 global tours this year including U2, One Direction and Luke Bryan. We're also further growing our portfolio with over 24 million fans attending our shows in the third quarter and as of October 26, we have sold 54 million tickets for shows this year, up 8% from last year. We continue to add more markets to our global footprint by adding Marek Lieberberg, the leading promoter in Germany to our global network of over 40 markets. Equally important is our focus on improving the fan experience and driving onsite revenues with per fan revenue at our venues up 8% or $30 million in constant currency so far this year. With core visibility for the year, we are confident we will again grow our concert live world by delivering 25,000 shows over 60 million fans. Our global reach and portfolio of artists, markets and shows is unparalleled in the live event business and continued success in concert is driving our overall business. Our sponsorship and advertisement business continues to deliver strong margins and growth to drive our AOI. For the first nine months sponsorship is up 19% in both revenue and AOI at constant currency. This growth has been driven by online advertising and a 40% growth in our festival sponsorship business in the third quarter at constant currency. Our key leading indicator for advertising is contracted net revenue, which is up 16% on a constant currency basis as of the end of the third quarter and we have sold over 90% of our planned sponsorship and advertising for the year. On the content side, we have launched Live Nation TV in beta and we are pleased with our overall portfolio of live-based content consisting of Yahoo! Live festival streaming and VICE original programming. They are all building and we have now delivered over 100 million streams to-date. We plan on further building our content presence to maximize on site content and brand demand. We believe we added great growth opportunities as we improved the advertising experience with brands that want to reach that highly desirable music fan on site and on all screen in a highly targeted fashion. Ticketmaster continues building its position as a global leader in the ticketing marketplace with 8% growth in the global site visits, driving an 18% increase in combined primary and secondary GTV during the third quarter. Our secondary business continued its strong performance with GTV up 22% in the quarter and our platform continues to take global market share with a superior offering of both primary and secondary. The same time, we continue to execute on our mobile core strategy rolling out improved mobile web, web and app experiences, including Apple Pay and integration into Apple Spotlight functionality. As a result of these improvements, 60% of our web traffic is on mobile devices and our total app installed base grew 39% year-on-year. With this, mobile net ticket sales are now 23% through September, accounting for 21% of total ticket sales. While we are improving the fan experience and delivering future scale in our ticketing marketplace, we also continue to deploy new venue products and reduce our cost structure. We are on track to have our new TMOne platform available for all North American venue clients by the end of the year and we expect to deliver the $0.35 per ticket cost reduction as planned. As a result, in 2015, we expect to deliver the fifth straight year of growth in our ticketing client base, global GTV and ticketing AOI. In summary, we now have very clear visibility into our full 2015 performance and we are confident that we'll deliver another year of record top line and bottom line results. Our scale businesses of concert, advertising and ticketing are all showing growth in the key operating metrics and we expect them to operationally deliver record revenue and AOI. As we look forward, we see tremendous opportunity to continue consolidating concerts and ticketing on a global basis and further growth in our advertising and ticketing businesses in the concert flywheel. With that, I will turn it over to Joe to take you through additional details on divisional performance. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first concerts. Live Nation concerts revenue in the third quarter was up 9% and AOI was up 6% on a constant currency basis. The revenue growth was driven by a 10% increase in attendance at our shows for the quarter, specifically our amphitheaters had over 10 million fans that attend 1,100 shows, is an all-time high, up over 1 million fans from Q3 last year. Arena attendance was up 30% to over 4 million fans for the quarter and festival attendance for Q3 was a record of 3.5 million fans. This translated into a record summer, looking to Q2 and Q3 for concerts with 40 million fans attending 12,000 shows globally, 9% higher attendance than last year. For the full year, we expect to deliver record attendance, increasing by about 3 million fans with 25,000 shows. And as a result, we expect to deliver strong double-digit AOI growth in our concerts business for the full year. At Artist Nation, revenue was up 6% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date at constant currency as we have been successful in growing our artist management and related businesses. AOI for the quarter is up 39% as we continue investing in new business lines, notably in sports management. And for the full year, we expect to deliver high single-digit revenue growth with Q4 largely in line with last year. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. Our sponsorship and advertising revenue for the third quarter grew by 17% and AOI was up 16% at constant currency. 62% of our revenue growth this quarter came from festival sponsorship, which increased 39% year-on-year at constant currency and festival sponsorship growth this year came primarily from increased monetization of our fans as we grew revenue per fan by 33% globally at constant currency. With over 95% of our sponsorship and advertising net revenue contracted for the year, we continue to expect full year AOI growth in the low teens at constant currency. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster revenue was up 16% and AOI was up 18% as global GTV increased 18%, all at constant currency. Primary GTV for the quarter was up 18% with a 12% increase in fee-bearing ticket sold. We continue to expect low to mid single-digit growth in primary fee bearing ticket volume and high single-digit growth in primary GTV for the year. Secondary GTV was up 22% for the quarter and it is up 40% year-to-date. Given the seasonal timing of sport, most of our secondary growth in the third quarter came from the concert segment, which was up 42%. Q4 will again be our biggest quarter for secondary GTV here in the NFL, NBA and NHL exchanges and we expect continued momentum in the quarter with ongoing double-digit growth rates in secondary GTV. We also continue to see strong fan response to our integrated primary and secondary offering on Ticketmaster with conversion rates 30% higher than primary only offering. The combination of primary and secondary GTV growth along with improved cost structure now gives us confidence, our ticketing business will deliver high single-digit AOI growth for the year. In summary, now nine months into the year, we have good visibility into delivering our 2015 plan. At this point of the year, we have most of our shows booked, concert ticket sold, sponsor signed up and visibility to sporting events and concert on sales to be confident on our performance for the year. With regards to FX in the quarter, we saw similar results in the third quarter as we did in the first and second with revenues and AOI both impacted by about 5%. And looking ahead, as we discussed we see strong runway for continued growth across our business lines. Our concert show pipeline for 2016, the earliest indicator we have looks very strong and is up double-digits from this time last year. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Joe. And good afternoon, everyone. Starting with our results for the third quarter. Revenue is $2.8 billion, up 10% from the same period in 2014 and AOI is $279 million, up 8% over last year, both at constant currency. As reported revenue is $2.6 billion and AOI is $266 million. Free cash flow is $205 million. Revenue growth for the quarter was driven by higher concerts revenue from increased shows in North America amphitheaters and arenas along with acquisition activity. Ticketing revenue growth also drove the increase with higher primary and resale revenue. Reported AOI for the third quarter was $266 million, 3% higher than last year. FX impact for the third quarter reduced AOI by $13 million or 5%. The majority of the AOI growth came from our ticketing and sponsorship and advertising segment. Ticketing AOI was driven by the higher primary and resale activity. Sponsorship and advertising AOI increased with higher festival sales along with other new sponsors. Concerts AOI was at 6% to last year at constant currency, while Artist Nation AOI was impacted by our continued investment in new service lines. Our operating income for the quarter was $154 million compared to $151 million last year. The FX impact to operating for the third quarter was a decrease of $10 million. Net income was $89 million compared to $105 million last year with an increase in taxes driven by the growth in profitability internationally. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $205 million, in line with last year. Now for the nine months results. Revenue is up 9% from last year to $5.8 billion and AOI is $504 million, up 4% over 2014 both at constant currency. As reported, revenue is $5.5 billion and AOI is $477 million. Our free cash flow for the nine months is $320 million or 67% of AOI. Revenue for the nine months was driven by growth in concerts from higher show activity in North American arenas and amphitheaters and acquisitions. The other main driver of the increase was ticketing with its higher revenue in both primary and resale tickets. All of our other business segments also delivered revenue growth over last year. AOI for the nine months was $477 million, as reported. FX impact for the nine months reduced AOI by $27 million or 5%. Sponsorship and advertising AOI grew 19% at constant currency, driven by increased festival sponsorship and higher online advertising. Ticketing AOI was up 11% at constant currency with higher primary and resale ticket sales. Concerts AOI was essentially flat, and Artist Nation's AOI was impacted from the investments in new service lines. Operating income was $172 million for the nine months compared to $194 million last year, with an $18 million reduction due to FX changes. Our net income for the nine months was $46 million versus $96 million last year, which was impacted by $9 million in additional acquisition-related tax benefits recognized in 2014, and a $31 million loss from non-cash adjustments to certain working capital accounts due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Free cash flow for the nine months is $320 million, in line with last year. During the first nine months of 2015, our cash flow was used primarily for acquisitions, artist advances for future tours and revenue generating CapEx. Moving to our key balance sheet items. As of September 30, we had total cash of $1.1 billion, including $547 million in ticketing client cash and $262 million in net concert event-related cash, with a free cash balance of $252 million. Our cash used in operating activities was $23 million for the nine months, an increase of $16 million over last year because of higher receivables in 2015 driven by the increased third quarter show activity. At the end of September, our concerts related deferred revenue for tickets sold for future events at our owned or operated venues was $441 million, a 38% increase over September last year. Our total capital expenditures for the nine months were $94 million, and we expect that our capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $155 million, around 2% of revenue, in line with our previous guidance. As of September 30, our total debt was $2 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3%. Our debt covenant currently requires a maximum leverage ratio of 5 times, and we are comfortably in compliance with this. Thank you for joining us today. And we will now open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, Ms. Willard. And our first question will come from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you, and congratulations on another great quarter. So, I have a bigger picture question. As you are wrapping up your three-year plan, it seems like a lot of the large scale acquisition spending is over. Where do you think are the largest buckets of organic growth over the next few years? Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Amy. It's Michael. First of all, I would say we still believe that there are some great acquisition opportunities available across the globe too that we think we can grow our business at a very accretive rate. But aside from that regardless of acquisitions, if you look at the historic business, we have been delivering most of our growth on an organic basis and we think we can continue to do more of that. We're going to do three things that are going to drive organic growth ongoing. Number one is what we talked about always is our advertising business. We think that has great runway because we believe Madison Avenue is going to continue shift more dollars to kind of event-based engaged business. We got a great platform. So we think the tide will rise on more dollars being spent in the events business and we'll continue to capture more of that as well as we grow our digital content business and on the mobile front, we'll be able to attract that. So we believe advertising will organically probably be our highest margin largest growth engine to our business. Ticketing, we believe, it just keeps getting better and better because all of the features and functions and products of our new mobile app coming out in 2016 to our expanded product offering. We just got a very robust roadmap ahead of us and we think all of those features and functions that we roll out across the globe at TM just help drive that conversion and incremental ticket. So that again is a high margin business because it's an incremental ticket against the cost base that's been spent. And three, we mentioned the onsite business. We just hired a Chief Revenue Officer who had a history at both Disney and Universal Theme Parks, who has been analyzing our onsite business. We beta tested these summer, six amphitheaters with a new food and beverage supplier, our new Live Nation at the venue app where it has everything from weekend entry to upgrade your seat to get your beer delivered to your seat, the cashless F&B and we saw some great results this summer when we provide a Wi-Fi connected environment, give that customer, let's call it the magic band, but its built into the app. Giving that customer an easier, frictionless experience onsite both at the festival or amps or House of Blues and we think that will be a big driver of our per head spend. So we think those three areas alone executing better and increased products in all three of those areas would be a big piece of our ongoing forward growth that will continue to drive us to record years. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Moving on to David Joyce with Evercore. David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI : Thank you. One of my question, I was just wondering about the phasing of the event timing with what you really experienced for the third quarter versus what you thought would be comparably shifting into the fourth. I was just wondering, there is still a lot of deferred revenue and prepaid expenses I think that is reflected in free cash indicating that there is a lot of volume in the fourth quarter. But was there anything that timing-wise got accelerated into the third or is everything still as planned from the last call? Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : I think things are still largely as planned. Q4 is a very big quarter for us this year in terms of show count, heavily driven on the theaters and club side. So that show count number is high. I think what you saw this summer, as we've talked about in the past, is just a seasonal, temporal, fewer stadiums this year, more amphitheaters, more arenas, more festivals and we think we disproportionally grew and took share during the summer season but largely what we expected in terms of show count attendance. David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI : So sponsorship and advertising will be later in the fourth quarter due to the size of the venue of the events that are on the slate? Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Well, again, it's not so much size of the venue. It is just \u2013 again, we talked about festival sponsorship in the past. We've talked about that's far and away our highest sponsorship per fan. Those are predominantly Q2, Q3 event. But just when you rollout the map that tends to be where you see your growth. David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI : And on Artist Nation, you talked about how AOI should shake out for the fourth quarter, obviously there is more spending for the sports management this quarter. Is that infrastructure largely in place or is there going to be more spending to ramp that up or build that out for next year? Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : No. I mean, that spending is largely in place and will continue. We expect to start to see more revenue from that next year and in just Q4, trying to give some guidance in terms of level of overall activity. Operator : And Doug Arthur with Huber Research has the next question. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Yeah, two questions. First sort of a technical issue. You had, looks like you had about a 40% increase in international events year-over-year in the third quarter. How much of that is acquisition related and how much of it is just timing? And then the second question, Michael on TMOne platform, what would you sort of characterize as sort of the five main benefits from it to the venues. Thank you. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: International, we've had no real acquisitions that would be driving activity. Most of those acquisitions in the last year would have been in the U.S. festival space. So, Europe just had strong year as did North America, all organic. As far as ticketing, we've been very, very honest and clear with everyone that we bought a \u2013 Ticketmaster has a very old platform. And part of the challenge with the platform was it just wasn't technically enough to grade 2015 web-based platform that lets us just be innovative and flexible and fast. So obviously the biggest part about having a new platform is we get to build an ongoing new mobile business that's much more flexible and can move with the times, meaning today historically when you want to get a new iPad or new iOS update or Android, everything was very expensive and hard on our old platform to move and build. So, the biggest fundamental advantage is our new platform has a much more robust, flexible base to it. For the venues, we have an open API platform strategy there so we can plug-and-play with a lot of their needs whether it's the CRM or security or any partners that they need us to partner with for the venue. Our app will come to life in real terms next year, will be much more robust and convert much higher than our current one. And then at the core of a venue, what the venue really is looking for is a saleforce.com kind of strategy. They want a very robust, but simple user interface to manage their event, to staff their event, to sell their event, to market it, to change the ticket prices, to build it. Our new platform TMOne is very user-friendly. Every venue will have a host of great tools available from pricing, data analytics, search, marketing, publishing. It's a world-class platform that no one in the world would have the robust amount of data and analytical tools to help view the venue, build your show, put it out, market it, distribute it if you want to sell tickets to other partners. It's a very robust platform. It's going to put all the tools now in your hands to be the best at selling, understanding your market, understanding pricing, we believe ultimately selling more tickets because we're putting a lot more tools and data into the hands of every box office and every general manager in a venue. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll now hear from Ben Mogil with Stifel. Kevin Lee Hon Siong - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thank you. This is actually Kevin Lee for Ben. Just a quick question on the secondary ticketing market. Of the growth you're seeing in GTV, how much is that from share shift from competitors and how much do think is coming from Ticketmaster growing the actual secondary market? Thank you. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Kevin, this is Joe Berchtold. There is not a great industry information out there in terms of getting specific on that, but we absolutely believe that we are taking share on a global basis with the quality of product that we're delivering, starting with the joint primary and secondary inventory we're putting on Ticketmaster and then getting into our league exchanges. So we don't have exactness of those numbers, but we absolutely believe with the high growth that we have in that business that we are taking share. Kevin Lee Hon Siong - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And Rich Tullo with Albert Fried & Company has the next question. Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. Little factoid, you grew Ticketmaster, your growth is as big as the whole Ticketfly. And they have a $550 million valuation, so that's I don't know what's Ticketmaster worth $20 billion? Over the last couple of days, you've seen Adele and Rihanna seeking to pitch sponsorship deals ahead of their concerts. Are you in that mix? How does that help you and how does that influence your business? I suspect it's generally favorable. But I'm just curious to see how it works? Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Tullo, I'm still digesting your $20 billion valuation. That's question of the day, but. Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: So it was just off the top of my head, I was just using like Reed Hastings, Ted Sarandos' numbers. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We certainly believe we have a very valuable asset that has lots of expansion ahead of it. Joe will dig in on the second part. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Yes. At its heart, Rich, our job is what the concert promoter and ticketing company is to sell ticket and make sure all the tickets for our artist shows get sold. We've got a host of services to do that ranging from our own fan club services to Ticketmaster, other specialty ticketing services. So, we support the concept of making sure all the tickets are sold. A lot of the technology development that Michael was just talking about at Ticketmaster is focused on creating more of an open platform and enabling the use of APIs on distributed commerce platform to more effectively sell those tickets. So, we think that we will see and we support the notion going forward, whether it's the artists or the teams, they are looking to retail and use other distribution channels as well to make sure we're selling a ticket in every corner possible. Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with no further questions, this does conclude the Live Nation Entertainment third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Thank you all for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Financial Officer (sic) [Chief Executive Officer] of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 conference call. 2015 closed as a record year for Live Nation, driving both financial and operating results. Revenue, AOI and free cash flow all grew 11% for the year, and delivered record ticket volume of 530 million tickets. We continue to see the tremendous power of live events with strong global consumer demand. Live is truly a unique entertainment form that cannot be duplicated. It is elevated and not threatened by technology and is borderless. Fans around the world can now discover, follow, share, and embrace artists, creating even greater demand for live shows. We believe the live music sector will continue to have strong growth for years to come, as fans globally drive demand, artists are motivated to tour, and technology is driving awareness and conversion. And we're seeing this come to life in our Live Nation Concerts division, which continued to grow its global market share, adding 5 million fans in 2015 for a total of over 63 million fans, while promoting 25,000 concerts, up 12% in the year from last year. We've built on our global leadership position in every part of the business, with more fans in both North America and international, and across our full portfolio of arenas, amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs. The ongoing flow of new artists also continues to re-energize the business. And in 2015, 13 of the top 20 selling artists were new from the previous year. We see growth continuing into 2016. And through February 19, ticket sales were up 5% year-on-year, driven by 18% growth in amphitheaters and 47% growth in stadiums. We are confident we will again see strong growth in fan demand across our business this year. Our Live Nation Advertising business grew 17% in 2015 at constant currency, increasing both on-site and online advertising, as we grew our global sponsor base by 20% to almost 900 brands. Onsite advertising drove the majority of our growth for the year, as we increased advertising per fan by 8% by continuing to develop new products for sponsors at our events. With 63 million attendees, Live Nation provides brands an audience larger than the NFL, NBA or NHL for direct consumer engagement. And we continue to see brands shifting dollars onsite. We also continued leveraging video content from our events, generating over 300 million views in 2015 on Live Nation Web and App and through our distribution partners at Yahoo!, Snapchat, YouTube and Apple. We expect continued advertising AOI growth at historic rate levels in 2016, with over 60% of our budgeted advertising for the year already sold and pacing ahead of last year at this time by double-digits. For the fifth straight year, Ticketmaster grew its ticketing volume and GTV by 12% at constant currency. Delivering over $25 billion in GTV, Ticketmaster continues to be one of the top global e-commerce sites operating in 23 countries. In 2015, secondary ticketing continued to be a major focus, now operating in 13 countries and delivering 34% growth in GTV per year of $1.2 billion at constant currency. As we focus on improving the fan buying experience, there continues to be a rapid shift to mobile devices as the preferred purchasing platform. At the end of 2015, over 21 million fans have downloaded one of our apps, a 37% increase over last year. This drove a 20% increase in mobile tickets for the year to 21% of total tickets. Entering 2016, the Ticketmaster marketplace is better positioned than ever as the ticketing leader in 16 countries. We have grown our client base each year over the last five years and, combining the primary and secondary marketplaces, have substantially increased inventory available to fans and conversion by 38%. We have heavily invested in online and mobile products to increase visits to our site and conversion. And as a result, already in 2016, we have three days selling over 900,000 tickets, placing them among the top 15 days of all time, setting us up to deliver a robust growth in 2016. As we look forward in 2016, all key indicators for each of our businesses are up on year-on-year into February, pointing to continued strong growth in 2016. We plan on holding more concerts for more fans in more countries than ever before. We expect to sell more advertising both onsite and online. And through continued product innovation at Ticketmaster, we plan on selling more tickets and driving increased conversion. Over the last three years, we have grown AOI by 34% and free cash flow by 45%, and we expect Live Nation to continue delivering this level of growth that we have demonstrated over the last several years. We see the global live sector continuing to be very robust from a supply and demand perspective. Combining a growing global industry and Live Nation's ability to grow its leadership position, we expect to continue driving long-term value for shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Joe, who will take you through additional details on the divisions. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first Concerts, for the full year, concert revenue was up 11% and AOI up 36%, both at constant currency. We grew attendance by 8% to a record 63 million fans, once again promoting 20 of the top 25 global tours, including U2, Madonna, One Direction, and Ariana Grande. And we've continued our global expansion with three new countries, including adding promoters in Germany, the second largest European concert market. For the year, looking at the markets, in North America, we grew attendance by 9% to almost 44 million fans with show counts up 6% and attendance per show up 3%. In arena and amphitheater, attendance were each up by over 1 million fans. Internationally, attendance was up 7%, driven by arena attendance growing over 1 million fans. Globally, we continued growing our festival portfolio, increasing attendance by 1.5 million to over 6 million for the year. Following our acquisition of Bonnaroo, we now own four of the top five festivals in North America. In addition to growing global market share through more shows, more fans and more markets, in 2015 we increased our onsite fan monetization at amphitheaters and festivals by 6% to $19.50 per fan. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, concert revenue was up 17% and AOI up 30%, both at constant currency. These results were driven by a 15% increase in attendance to over 15 million fans, with a 13% increase in show count. Of this, North America attendance grew by 9% in the quarter, largely from festival and amphitheater activity, and international attendance was up 26% driven by arena activity. As we move into 2016, through mid-February, ticket sales are up as Michael said, and our confirmed show pipeline for amphitheaters, arenas and stadiums is up 15%. And we already have two artists, Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9, that have each sold over 1 million tickets for tours this year. At Artist Nation, revenue was up 13% at constant currency in 2015. Last year, we broadened our relationships with a great set of managers and artists and expanded into new business lines. Looking forward, we expect this business to continue feeding our Concerts business and providing an important foundation of support for all our businesses. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business, Sponsorship & Advertising delivered 17% revenue and 15% AOI growth for the year at constant currency. And in fourth quarter, at constant currency, revenue was up 11% and AOI was flat as we compare the AOI to the fourth quarter 2014 when we had 24% year-on-year growth. Finally, Ticketmaster. In 2015, ticketing revenue was up 10% while AOI was up 11%, as we grew global GTV on fee-bearing tickets by 12%, all at constant currency. Achieving these results at Ticketmaster came from delivering on three key drivers. First, increasing our ticket inventory, which was accomplished by maintaining our net renewal rate at over 100% for the sixth straight year and building our secondary marketplace with nearly double the number of events having integrated inventory. Second, with improved products, we drove a 10% increase in site visits along with increased conversion from integrated inventory. This drove primary GTV growth of 10% for the year and secondary GTV growth of 34%, both at constant currency. And finally, we delivered the $0.35 per ticket North America cost savings that we targeted. For the fourth quarter, our GTV and revenue were both up 11% and AOI up 10% at constant currency. So in summary, in 2015, each of our core businesses grew revenue and AOI as we successfully delivered the final year of our three-year plan. Looking forward, in 2016, we expect to continue our growth with Concerts, Advertising, and Ticketing leading indicators all strongly up, giving us confidence in our ability to continue growing our business at historical rates. A few points of note, first, from a phasing standpoint, with our planned strong summer season across amphitheaters, arenas, and stadiums, we expect our AOI to be even more Q3 driven this year and a bit more Q2 driven as well. And on FX, we don't see a material impact on Q1 at this point. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting with our results for the fourth quarter, revenue is $1.8 billion, up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2014, and AOI is $111 million, up 54% over last year, both at constant currency. As reported revenue is $1.7 billion and AOI is $101 million. Free cash flow is $10 million for the quarter. All of our segments delivered revenue growth for the quarter. Concerts delivered the majority of the growth from higher festival and amphitheater activity in North America, and increased arena activity internationally. Ticketing revenue was up due to both higher primary and secondary ticket volume. Reported AOI for the fourth quarter was $101 million, up 40% from the fourth quarter last year. FX impact for the quarter reduced AOI by $10 million, or 9%. The majority of our AOI growth in the quarter came from the Concerts and Artist Nation segments. Concerts improved from increased show activity, and Artist Nation AOI was driven by higher management commissions and increased profitability within new service lines. Our operating loss in the fourth quarter was $34 million on a constant currency basis, up 17% compared to the normalized loss of $41 million last year that excluded non-cash charges of $146 million. FX impacts in the quarter increased the operating loss by $7 million to $41 million on a reported basis. Our net loss for the quarter was $71 million at constant currency, a 12% improvement from the normalized net loss last year of $81 million, again excluding non-cash charges. The FX impact for the fourth quarter increased the net loss by $7 million to $78 million on a reported basis. Moving to the full year results, revenue is $7.6 billion, AOI is $616 million and free cash flow is $362 million, each up 11% over last year at constant currency. As reported, revenue is $7.2 billion, AOI is $578 million, and free cash flow is $335 million. For the full year, all of our segments delivered double-digit revenue growth. Concerts was the largest driver with growth in our North America arena, festival, and amphitheater results, along with strong arena activity internationally. The other main driver of the increase was in ticketing with higher primary and resale ticket volume driven by more concerts and professional sporting events. AOI for the full year was $578 million, as reported. FX impact for the year reduced AOI by $38 million or 6%. Sponsorship & Advertising AOI grew 15% at constant currency from higher festival sponsorships and online advertising. Ticketing AOI was up 11% at constant currency, driven by the growth in primary and secondary ticket sales. And Concerts AOI was up 36% at constant currency from higher show activity. Operating income at constant currency was $156 million for the full year, in line with normalized operating income of $161 million last year, excluding non-cash charges. FX impact for the year reduced the operating income by $25 million to $131 million on a reported basis for 2015. Our net loss for the year was $13 million at constant currency. The FX impact for the year increased the net loss by $20 million to $33 million on a reported basis. Free cash flow for the year is $362 million at constant currency, up 11% over last year, driven by our growth in AOI. Moving to our key balance sheet items. As of December 31, we had total cash of $1.3 billion, including $549 million in ticketing client cash and $351 million in net concert event related cash with a free cash balance of $403 million. Cash flow from operations was $300 million for 2015, an increase of 8% compared to $277 million last year. Our total deferred revenue for future shows as of the end of 2015 was $553 million, up 19% over the $464 million at the end of 2014. Our total capital expenditures for the year were $145 million, with maintenance CapEx of $79 million and revenue-generating CapEx of $66 million. Going forward, we expect total capital expenditures to continue to be around 2% of revenue. As of December 31, our total net debt was $2 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.2%. Our debt covenant requires a maximum leverage ratio of 4.75 times, and we are comfortably in compliance with this. Thank you for joining us today. And we will now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : And we will first go to Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I have two questions, one on ticketing and one on ad sponsorship. So StubHub has talked about growth slowing in 2016 and that probably bodes well for you. But can you give us some additional color on market share and progress in the secondary market? And then secondly, as you expand globally, how are your conversations changing with your sponsors and ad buyers? Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll do the sponsorship, which is the easier one, and we'll look into ticketing, which revolves around share. Our Sponsorship business, we have as we said 900 sponsors. Our business of those 900, a majority of those are a local or a regional business. So when we open an office in South Africa, our first priority is to build a local sponsorship team to take advantage of the regional Coca-Cola or Audi dealership ad dollars, who are usually the easiest and more likely to spend on an onsite regional basis. So every time we open up a regional office, we get to enter a new business called the regional advertising business. And then the top 10% of our sponsors, the Citibanks, the American Expresses, the Pepsis of the world, the more times we walk into top kind of 15, 20 cities around the world, we start to be able to expand our U.S. deal, which started in American Express, but then became a U.S./Canada deal, then it became a U.S., Canada and European deal, and now we've just added Australia to it. So as we build, we're able to attract those global brands and provide them a global footprint. If you think about it, really the only other sport that can do that is kind of FIFA World Cup or the Olympics. Most of everything else is a local business. So we do provide that brand like Anheuser-Busch, who we're talking to on a global basis, a global platform solution. And we see that as a big opportunity in how we'll keep our double-digit growth. On secondary. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. On secondary, obviously it's a little bit of guesswork on the market share, Amy. I think our take would be that our market share is now in the 20s. From StubHub's reported numbers, seems like they're likely in the 50s. Seems that we both grew in 2015 faster than overall market, so continued to build share. We remain very positive on our positioning and our ability to continue to drive our growth and share overall. When you look at the asset base that we have, the partnerships with the teams and the leagues and the very rapid growth that we've seen on Ticketmaster with our integrated inventory, and now that we're in 13 countries and at varying levels of integration between the primary and secondary, I think we remain very positive about 2016 with that business. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We will now go to Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I'm going to break the rules here a little bit, but maybe you'll indulge me, because I'm really asking you a question. That's my job, not yours. I am perplexed by the way your stock has traded sort of over the last two months. And I don't know if you have any insight in terms of why you think the market is nervous about something, and if at all you think these results have sort of addressed whatever the buy side's concerns may be. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think there's a whole bunch of debate out there on what's happened in the last couple months in the market overall. So we certainly have felt it. We talk to our top shareholders, the long players. Our long shareholders seem to understand that our fundamental business is strong with great growth potential. So we can't give you any perfect insight into what would have been the reason for any decline over the last couple months. But as we say, we're just thrilled that going into this quarter we were going to put down a record 2015 on our way to hopefully a record 2016. So we've been public 10 years now and we've lived long enough to know that the stock price will follow the good results eventually in between the noise in the middle. So we're very confident, we've got a very strong business that we'll continue to grow, put the cash flow on the table and be a really good option for a investment in the entertainment or the music space. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : And we will now go to Ben Mogil with Stifel. Kevin Lee Hon Siong - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you. This is actually Kevin Lee for Ben. Thank you for taking the question. A few years ago, you gave multiple-year guidance and the drivers behind that. Not expecting it \u2013 this on this call, but when you look at the core engines of Ticketing and Sponsorship, I just want to dig a little deeper. What takes Ticketing from, say, the current level to, say, $425 million or so of AOI? Is it more cost efficiency, more primary or secondary volume? And similarly, on Sponsorship, what kind of gets it to the $325 million level? Is it more impressions, volume, or is it just moving up the rate card? Thank you. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Yes. I think we're doing a good job, at least in this call, of suggesting that we believe we'll repeat history in terms of our growth rate. So if you looked at our stock over the last three years and what we've been able to do on a revenue and a cash flow perspective, we see no reason why we can't continue to grow this business at the similar rates. In order to grow, I mean number one is we have an incredible unique business model at this point. With our scale leveraged across our flywheel, we're able to drive some more concerts, which drives a bigger audience, which drives more sponsors, which drives more ticketing fees. So you're really starting to see the flywheel effect of our business. So how will we grow Ticketing? Both ways you mentioned. We'll continue to be more efficient as our new and improved technology comes to life, and we get to retire our old platform and technology that was much more inefficient. So we'll have a per-ticket savings over time, and we'll continue to drive our savings on that side. But we still have Ticketmaster on a global basis. And one of the things we've done I think really well at Ticketmaster when we took over is to redefine our business. Ticketmaster was looked always at a very I think narrow perspective of the business called Arenas in America. And we look at Ticketing on a global basis, so why we talk about being in 22 countries and growing that, why we're very excited on secondary to get way ahead of the curve on those other 12 markets outside of America. So we think we can grow the pie, we can grow our market share within secondary and grow it on a global basis. And we still think we have a lot of room, whether it be in clubs and theaters with TicketWeb, one of our products, whether it's festivals with Front Line, we still think we have room in a lot of the niches within the industry that we have currently or historically not served. So we think we have lots of room to grow vertical and horizontal in ticketing as well as achieving costs through a more efficient platform. Sponsorship, as I said, is kind of \u2013 the bigger a platform becomes on a global basis, the more people we put through the turnstiles, the more attractive we are to Madison Avenue. So we're seeing \u2013 we're able to increase our ad units, rate card as you said, taking a local partner up to a regional partner or renew him at a higher rate, because we have better assets both onsite and online. So we look at Sponsorship, it's somewhere in the $2 billion number is what the latest reports would say is spent on music in America out of the advertising budget. So we're still, we would say, dramatically under our market share. We could double our Advertising business before we have to actually even get out of that kind of $2 billion that is dedicated by Madison Avenue to go spend on music onsite activation. So we still think there's a big pie available. The better our ad units and the better our positioning of our business is for Madison Avenue, we think we will continue to grow that business through rate card and through higher per-deal metrics. Kevin Lee Hon Siong - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : We will now go to David Joyce with Evercore ISI. David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI : Thank you. I was hoping you could provide some more color on some recent transactions. In South Africa, how much business were you already flowing through there and what does this new deal do for you? Is it solely promotions? I know you spoke earlier of the opportunity to open a sponsorship office. But if you could help us understand what that does for your growth, that sort of thing. And then secondly on the Sacramento markets, you acquired a property. I'm not sure if it's actually a real estate deal, but it's something that'll be programmed or continue to be programmed like House of Blues. What does that do for you as opposed to a much bigger, say, festival acquisition where you start to see positive results after a year? Thank you. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'll work backwards. Sacramento, I was surprised how much press I did see on that one too, given the size of it. So that would have been our theater and, I mean they must have very good PR people at the Ace of Spades that we're doing the deal with. But it's a theater club. We have theater and club division. We would book/manage over 100 theaters or clubs, kind of in the 1,000 to 3,000 range. It's a strong category for us globally. And my team, under Ron Bension, is continually looking for theaters and clubs where we would be taking over booking to drive our business into. So that'd be a small deal in relative terms to our business. But that 100-plus theaters and clubs, which is a great platform for us because it tends to be younger skewed, which means we get to present to the Red Bulls and the young sponsors that are really looking for a very young demo, and it also drives our ticketing business. So they're continually looking for opportunistic theater or clubs to manage and/or book in a kind of a non-CapEx manner. As far as South Africa, it continues to be our 41 countries and a path we've been on. When you look around the world, there tends to be these markets like South Africa, Cape Town, where there may be an established promoter who really has a strong market share. He is the go-to kind of promoter or business for any artist that goes to South Africa. We've been working with Attie for years, and he's been our go-to promoter for years. So at a certain point, we've been talking about a deal where instead of spending Rihanna and selling off to Attie where he's monetizing all of the local business, you get to a point where our business is so scalable now on a global basis that when we move into markets like that and acquire and continue to consolidate kind of the global footprint, we then our synergies of drive with local promoter, build our sponsor business and drive our ticketing economics, make it very accretive for us. South Africa, we don't think it's a short-term a big business for us, but we think over long term over the next five years, we think it is a growth industry, one of those emerging markets that, again, if you are a 19-year old fan in South Africa, Cape Town right now, you are on YouTube and you're dying to see Rihanna or Beyonc\u00e9. So the more and more we sit with these artists and talk about what's their global plans, the more and more they are now looking at places like South America and Asia and South Africa and Cape Town to add to their itinerary. And we want to be ahead of the curve on having our platform in place so we can monetize that content when it touches down. David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will now go to John Tinker with Gabelli Brokerage Company. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thanks. Hi. Just a couple of quick questions. On the three-year guidance you've hit, as you go forward, how important are acquisitions for you in order to hit sort of a double-digit AOI number as opposed to organic growth? Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : John, this is Joe. I think if you look at our business model, we have always viewed tuck-in acquisitions as an integral part where we look to buy pieces that we can feed into the flywheel and add ticketing, add sponsorship, leverage up those. But really the foundation is organic. With the flywheel where it is now, it's now at a scale that we think we can drive very strong growth. And then again, you're just looking in for little pieces that you can build on top of. Like the one we were just talking about, when we bring ticketing, we bring sponsorship, and really put a lot of organic growth on top of the pieces that we put together. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: And secondly, this may not be a totally fair question. Liberty Media is creating three tracking stocks in the next couple of months. And their ownership in, their stake in you will be kept in Liberty Media, and Sirius and Atlanta Braves will be spun off. But you'll also basically be with 20% of the Atlanta Braves. How do you think you fit into sort of the Liberty Media structure? And do you see any crossovers in any way with the Braves? Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You led with I think it was an unfair question, is that how you phrased it? John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: No, I was giving you an out. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You can ask them at the next Liberty investor dinner we go to. Listen, Liberty has been a great, solid shareholder for us there. Greg and John and Mark Carleton have been very instrumental in playing long with our strategy. We've made them a lot of money since we merged businesses and we both have done very well together. And we would expect Liberty to be a long-term shareholder and a great contributor to our strategy. Where and how they do what with their tracking stocks, as you know, that's not important to me. What's important is that we deliver good returns for our shareholders and good things happen when that happens. And that's our focus and we'll keep doing that for Liberty and others. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thanks. Operator : And we will go to Rich Tullo with Albert Fried. Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. How should we be thinking about ticketing \u2013 I mean concert growth in 2016? Are we talking about expenses on a percentage basis equivalent to what happened in 2015? And is there any areas in particular driving the growth? And on Latin America, is there anything to be concerned about given the geopolitical volatility in Brazil and Venezuela? Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : All right. So in terms of the 2016 outlook, I think a few of the things that we gave you were that year-to-date our sales are up 5% driven with very strong amphitheater up 18% and stadiums up 47%, and also that our \u2013 if you look at our pipeline of confirmed shows today versus the pipeline of confirmed shows across amphitheaters, arenas, and festivals a year ago at this time, that's up 15%. So both of those metrics are indicating that all of our core type of shows are looking up this year. Stadium was a bit of a lighter year last year, so you're seeing a much higher percentage uptick this year than in the others, but every one of those numbers indicates continued strong growth. I don't think we're at a point where we're going to call exactness on that yet, but certainly looking good from where we're at. In terms of Latin America, again, for us, this is a global portfolio of 40 countries and 25,000 concerts with 60 million fans. I think our experience is, is that in any given year you'll have economically, politically a little bit on the margins of ups and downs, but nothing that we at all see would have any material impact on our business. Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Live Nation has continued growing its business in 2016, with first quarter revenue up 10% and AOI up 7% on constant-currency basis. With strong operating performance across all three divisions, our Concerts, Advertising and Ticketing business. More importantly four months into the year we have enough information from leading indicators to be confident that we are on track to deliver record top line and bottom line results in 2016 as we continue building global market share in all our businesses. We have built the industry's most scalable and unparalleled live platform, connecting over 500 million fans to that magical two-hour event each year. Concerts continue to be the flywheel for our high-margin On-Site Retail, Advertising, and Ticketing segments, and this year will be another step forward in the company delivering strong long-term growth. Starting with our concerts business, ticket sales are pacing 10% ahead of last year through April 29, with over 35 million tickets already sold. We continue to be the world's leading promoter with 21 of the top 25 global tours in 2016, including Beyonc\u00e9, Coldplay, Guns N' Roses, Rihanna and Drake, driving a 13% increase in stadium, arena and amphitheater shows for the year, as of the end of April. Festivals continue to have a strong appeal for fans, artists and advertisers, and we are continue to build on our leadership position with 78 festivals with 7 million fans attending. We see continued growth in festivals across the globe in both large and niche size, with many markets still under-serviced. Along with attendance growth, we also expect to continue growing on high-margin on-site revenue this year as we continue to rollout new tech-powered product offerings at both amphitheaters and festivals. Such items as ordering from your seats at the amphitheater from your app, to expanded cashless ordering at our festivals. And at the same time, we are expanding our global footprint, most recently adding South Africa as the 37th country we promote in, and our acquisition of Founders Entertainment which builds our presence in New York and adds Governors Ball to our festival portfolio. Our Artist Nation division continues to attract managers organically and through targeted acquisitions that continues to feed our core businesses. The Sponsorship & Advertising business continued its strong growth in the first quarter, with revenue up 13%, AOI up 9% on a constant currency. Through April, we have sold over 70% of our expected advertising for the year, positioning us for another year of double-digit growth. Our contracted online advertising is up 14% through April as we further leverage our ability to integrate ticket-buying customer data to create more targeted profile, leading to increased effectiveness of digital buys in music. And our contracted sponsorship is up 10% through April as more brands see the value from our scale platform of over 60 million fans as an effective way to directly connect with their customers. Ticketmaster continued to build its global marketplace in the first quarter, increasing GTV by 18% at constant currency. This growth was led by continued strength in our secondary ticketing business, with GTV up 43% at constant currency, making this quarter the eighth consecutive quarter with growth over 20% in secondary GTV. Primary ticketing GTV grew by 16% for the quarter at constant currency. The month of February was the largest ever at Ticketmaster, selling over 17 million tickets globally, and during the quarter we had five of the top 20 days in the history of Ticketmaster. Over the past year, we have reinforced our position as the top global ticketing partner for venues and content, adding over 150 new clients to our strong venue base of 12,000. On the product side, one of our main areas of focus continues to be delivering a great mobile experience for fans buying at Ticketmaster. At this point, our websites are largely mobile response ready, and we have continued to upgrade our iOS and Android apps. As a result, we have increased our mobile ticketing sales by 30% year-on-year, now accounting for over 25% of all ticket sales. During the first quarter we also made huge strides in realizing our vision of an open API marketplace. We launched our full \u2013 our first fully functional API with Bandsintown, enabling fans to directly search Ticketmaster's inventory and buy tickets without leaving Bandsintown app. This week we are launching the same functionality with Facebook, both with their app and online, and expect to rapidly scale from there. While still early, initial results show strong conversion and uplift in incremental sales. With Ticketmaster off to a great start over the first four months in 2016, we expect to continue profit growth trend of the past several years, and continued opportunity for years to come. Overall, 2016 is on track to be another record year of growth and record results for the company. All the leading indicators for our concerts, sponsorship and ticketing businesses are performing ahead of last year's record year, as we expect each of these businesses to deliver revenue, AOI and free cash flow growth this year. Our results are demonstrating the fundamental strength and growth of the live entertainment space and Live Nation's positioning to deliver long-term profit and cash flow growth. Now over to Joe Berchtold to take you through more details in the divisions. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first Concerts. Live Nation Concerts revenue was up 12% on a constant currency basis, and AOI was down due to show mix, notably lower arena activity in North America. Given Q1 is traditionally our slowest quarter for concert activity, what matters most at this point of the year is our pipeline of shows and tickets sold to-date for shows this year. Our show count for the year is tracking toward a mid-single digit growth rate, with double digit growth in our core arena, amphitheater and stadium shows. This growth is particularly strong internationally this year, where we expect over 20% growth in arena and stadium shows, and given the strong show count growth, particularly in our larger venues, we expect high single-digit growth in fan attendance for the year, and based on this, we expect to deliver double-digit AOI growth in Concert segment for the year, with a particularly strong third quarter. At Artist Nation, revenue is essentially flat while AOI showed slight improvement. Similar to Concerts, the first quarter is typically our lowest activity, so what matters more is our pipeline for the rest of the year, and based on what we see now, we expect a strong Q2 and Q3 for the business, with Q2 back to profitability, and for the full year growing AOI at double-digit rates. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business, revenue in constant currency grew by 13%, and AOI grew by 9% for the first quarter. Here again, over 85% of our AOI is typically in the second quarter through fourth quarters. So, it is our confirmed sales pipeline that is our key leading indicator, and the pipelines for both sponsorship and online advertising are looking strong. In sponsorship, the growth is particularly coming from North America, since we have added several new multi-million dollar strategic partnerships and also continue to see strong growth in our festival sponsorship. With online advertising, we're seeing double-digit growth in contracted sales for both North America and international as we further leverage our database of consumer spending on live events and tie that to targeted online ad placement. Based on commitments to-date and our strong pipeline, we expect to deliver AOI growth for Sponsorship & Advertising consistent with the past several years. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, revenue in constant currency was up 10% and AOI was up 6%. Primary ticketing fee-bearing GTV was up 16% to $2.8 billion at constant currency for the quarter. Over half of this growth came from the Concerts segment with most of the rest coming from sports and arts. And this primary growth was consistently strong globally with North America GTV up 10% and international GTV up 29%. In secondary ticketing, GTV increased by 43% for the quarter with 40% plus growth in each North America and internationally. In North America, this growth was largely from our TM+ integrated inventory product which drove most of our increased GTV in the quarter. And as we scale Ticketmaster and add additional targeted verticals, we also remain focused on the cost structure of our operating model. After delivering our planned cost per ticket savings over the past three years, we will extract further savings in our core business this year. This combined with the higher growth rate of lower scale secondary festival and do-it-yourself businesses, we expect we'll deliver stable margins for the overall division for the year. For the full year, we expect the amortization of non-recoupable ticketing advances to be flat to last year, and when adjusted for purchase price accounting largely flat since 2013, as we expect to drive 20% plus growth in both revenue and AOI over that same period. Taken together, we expect to deliver mid to high single digit AOI growth in ticketing this year. And in summary, four months into the year, given the strength in all of our leading indicators, we feel confident we will deliver another record result in 2016. Looking at seasonality, we expect Q2 to deliver AOI at roughly the same percentage of full year AOI as last year. And on FX, we saw a 1% to 2% impact on the business in Q1 and, based on rates today, expect Q2 to be about the same. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Joe. And good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2016 : our revenue is up 10% to $1.2 billion and AOI is up 7% to $74 million, both at constant currency. As reported, revenue is $1.2 billion and AOI is $73 million, and free cash flow is $10 million for the quarter. Our Concerts deferred revenue for tickets sold for events in the future at our owned or operated venues is one of our most important leading financial indicators. And as of the end of the first quarter, our deferred revenue was $1.2 billion, an increase of 29% over the balance in March of last year of $919 million. The majority of our revenue growth in the first quarter to $1.2 billion was driven by concerts and ticketing. Concerts had increased international activity, largely in Australia and Asia, and we also had more shows in our theaters and clubs business. Ticketing revenue growth was driven by higher resale GTV in both sports and concerts, and we also had higher primary ticket sales globally. Reported AOI for the first quarter was $73 million, up 5% over last year, largely due to the increased primary and secondary ticketing activity. Our operating loss in the first quarter was $33 million. This loss is higher than the $24 million operating loss last year, largely due to higher acquisition-related intangibles impact in 2016. And our net loss for the quarter was $45 million, an improvement from the net loss of $58 million in the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to net foreign exchange rate gains of $8 million from revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets. We currently estimate that we will record approximately $45 million of accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest during 2016, based on our current asset base, which impacts the calculation of earnings per share. This is related to certain of our put/call arrangements in acquisitions where the value of the put is recognized over time to APIC (13:55). Moving to our key balance sheet items, as of March 31, we had total cash of $1.7 billion, including $663 million in ticketing client cash and $758 million in net concert event related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $278 million. Cash flow from operations was $517 million compared to $348 million in the first quarter of 2015, with the increase driven from our higher event related deferred revenue. Free cash flow was $10 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $25 million last year. As we often don't buy 100% in an acquisition to keep our entrepreneurial partners motivated, we will make distributions to our partners at different times in the year and the payments will vary from quarter to quarter. These distributions were higher in the first quarter of 2016, which impacted free cash flow for the quarter. For full year 2016, we expect our free cash flow as a percentage of AOI to be higher than 2015. Our total capital expenditures for the quarter were $25 million, with maintenance CapEx of $14 million and revenue generating CapEx of $10 million. We currently expect total capital expenditures of approximately $170 million to $175 million for the full year 2016, with about 60% of that to be spent on revenue generating CapEx. As of March 31, our total net debt was $2 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3%. We are comfortably in compliance with our debt covenant that requires a maximum leverage ratio of 4.75 times. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will take our first question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you, and congrats on another great quarter. So, two questions, first, on digital initiatives and the second question is on Ticketmaster. Can you update us on how your digital initiatives are going, particularly the one with Vice? What's been the feedback from consumers, and how big do you think this ad opportunity could be? And my second question is on some of the cost savings for Ticketmaster longer-term. I know, you're calling for stable margins this year, but perhaps if you can talk about some of the margin expansion opportunities going forward, that would be great? Thank you. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Amy. It's Michael. I'll take the first one, and Joe will talk to second. Digital, I assume you meant the video content we're producing? So we're going to be flying tonight \u2013 or tomorrow we're going to go and we'll be at the New Front in front of a bunch of advertisers, taking them through our portfolio of content. So the thesis is simple. We have 25,000 shows, 85 or 78 festivals that we own. There's lots of great social content happening from all of those great events. We have 900 advertisers, and over the last couple years, obviously those 900 advertisers would say to you we'd love to buy some advertising, we love to buy sponsorship, we wish you had some content, some video from these great events. So that's when we started, whether it was Yahoo! for proof-of-concept, Vice as a producing partner. We hired a great executive internally, Heather Parry, who was at MTV for years. And we're about to announce some other distributor deals, what we've been able to build and create, whether it's live streaming those 25,000 shows or shoulder content around the live experience, live from the festival, backstage, interviews, all the ways that you would expect. So, we're very happy that we've been walking slowly, self-funding it through advertising, building a roster. We have over I think 80 pieces of content from our Vice original series. We've now streamed 400 to 500 shows. We're publishing that in lots of places, whether it's Snapchat for festivals or whether it's Facebook and others. So we're very happy that we have a very strong internal skillset and partners now that can help us create great content from our business, publish that, whether it's for brands or whether it's published across all of the forms where the fans are, and adding an ad unit to our roster of ad units that our 900 sponsors now can also purchase while they're buying a sponsorship, a digital advertising or a deeper content ad unit. So we're going to talk about it more tomorrow at our New Front, and talk about, kind of, our wider portfolio of partners, but we think it's an incredibly important piece to our overall mission. We said three years ago that we would double advertising, that it would be one of our largest, highest margin growth opportunities, we still have been very bullish to tell you that over the next three years we think we can continue to double that business. We think it's going to be the biggest high margin piece of our growth story. It's fed from our concerts and our ticketing database, and we think having video content of a live concert has to be a fundamental ad unit in our roster of ad units. And that will be one component to how we keep growing double digit over the next two years to three years. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Amy, this is Joe. On the Ticketmaster question, I think as you know, our primary obsession is continuing to drive Ticketmaster's global market share in ticketing, which then in turn drives the top line of that business, the AOI and the cash generation. So we've talked a lot lately about how we're expanding in secondary and festival and do it yourself; all businesses that have lower scale, and therefore not yet their margin maturity of the core Ticketmaster business. So as we take cost out of that core traditional Ticketmaster business, there is some offset with the margin mix in terms of where the growth is going to come from? And we're going to continue to be obsessed at looking at every additional vertical, looking at new markets to go into, expanding our position internationally, both in the core business as well as in those different verticals. So we're going to be very focused on managing the cost structure and operating model of our traditional business as we get more and more technology out there and more self-serve with it, which will let us lower the cost of that. But I think as you look at the division overall for the next several years, again what you'll see, our focus has been is growing the topline AOI and cash flow from building the business, much more than anything else. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Michael, I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the success you had in some of the pilots last year with some of the onsite ways to reach the customer and get them to spend more, sounds like you're rolling that out to even more venues this year. Is there any color you can give us on, kind of, the numbers behind it? What sort of success you had last year? And how big this initiative in terms of rollout will be in 2016? Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And you're talking about our on-site pilots? John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Exactly. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Well, we always like to highlight it because quite honestly it's one of those core businesses that we do that don't really get the focus. Most people talk about the ticket sale, and what we're really always been about is the per-head spend, right. That's why we're more interested in getting you in the venue and then figuring out how to make our $15 to $20 per head, whether it's in our venue or someone else's. So we've been, year after year, growing our on-site per head business. And one of the roadblocks over the last five years was when we would be able to really get the Wi-Fi connection and at what cost that would come at. And we waited, we didn't \u2013 five years ago, we looked at it, and four years ago, and the CapEx cost to make sure our theaters, our clubs, our amphitheaters and our festivals had really great Wi-Fi, it was too cap intensive, so we knew that would come down. We're at that position now where we've been able to strike a great deal with Cisco in terms of getting our amps and our venues Wi-Fied. It's going to be a great sponsorship relationship with them, as we go deeper with Cisco. And it's going to be a positive revenue business for us, so we can have that Wi-Fi installed now at our venues, and we start to make money day one from both sponsorship and then selling on-site, advertising in the app, upgrading your seat, selling you food and beverage. So last year, we piloted it with our app, instant delivery to your seat, order from your seat, express lanes. And we had to get the pieces of plumbing in place. We had Legends last year, our new provider, who was much more innovative, or able to deliver us this unique experience. We had to get the Wi-Fi provider. We spent the last six months reviewing all options and picked Cisco. And this summer, we will have that rolled out across 20 of our amphitheaters, a lot of our festivals. And our initial results continue to say that it is a great way to add $1 or $2 per head when you have the business and that opportunity of those new products presented to that fan on-site. So if you look at our core festival business, you can start seeing over the next two years to three years one of the great growth movers is going to be looking at how many customers walk in our venue and getting a closer Disneyland gap, as we've said in our assessment before, moving us one step forward towards the major league baseball \u2013 the leaders in sports, and the Disneylands \u2013 on getting us closer to $20-$25 per head. And this time, we think we'll have some great bottom line results in our Concert division, and those continue to scale over the next few years. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you for that. I wanted to ask a big picture question to you and the team. If I think about the phase of each of your businesses right now, you guys have spent a lot of time and a lot of money kind of recalibrating them, and kind of getting them on a new path, and they're all doing really well right now. So if I think about kind of the next three years \u2013 if I think about technology, if I think about content, and if I think about, even the things like the Roc Nation sports deal that you guys have been doing, how do you \u2013 what \u2013 how would you prioritize the business units in terms of capital spend and investment right now? Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think, if you look at where we're going to spend our dollars, I mean, one of the realities is \u2013 most of our growth has still been organic. So, I forget the latest percentage we said out loud, Joe. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : But it's, yeah, I mean, 90%-plus of our AOI this year is organic. And the vast, vast majority of our growth, year-on-year, is organic. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Organic. So, just to state, the business and the execution is why the cash flow and AOI has been growing, not the bolt-on acquisitions over the last three years. So we continue to think we got lots of room to execute better, and continue to have record years for the next years to come. In terms of, then capital allocation of resources \u2013 fundamentally, number one, is to continue to make sure we consolidate and scale our global concert business. Because the number one competitive advantage we have in the world is, we have 73 million customers walking in our door, and we're providing 1,500 artists an year, an incredible platform to get on the road and tour. That is the part that is very hard to replicate. And we're going to make sure that that continues to grow, because we think there's lots of great global opportunities. So that's why you see us do most of our M&A there, on a global basis, because we still think those are really accretive opportunities. When you buy a Gov Ball, who's been on Eventbrite ticketing, you over \u2013 now, you make it a Ticketmaster opportunity. You add sponsors, because they were under-serviced \u2013 and overnight, you've got a very accretive business. So you'll continue to see us making sure that we build our global business. That is our competitive advantage. From that, that feeds our higher-margin ticketing business, helps us either renew clients, find new clients or proof of concept, lets us sell to other clients who see what we're doing with our business. We don't need to do as much M&A on Ticketmaster. It's been more of a fixed cost, get the right engineers in, keep the team competitive, upgrade the team, make sure we got the quality team that can build. One of the real advantages we don't really mention is now that the platform is in place, the real benefit is being able to do an API for Facebook \u2013 with a very small team and a quick timeline, but you can build that product now. That was unobtainable with legacy TM. So a lot of the plumbing that's been invested in is going to let us continually just keep building good products that we can roll out fast to meet the market opportunity. We'll continually \u2013 we look internationally at M&A for ticketing. We tend to still find most of them over-valued. We believe that our platform in international and the U.S. are world class and we'll continue to add clients to the platforms versus probably spend any high multiples for ticketing M&A around the world. But we do review them and if we think there's a good ticketing company that can help us advance our global strategy, we'll look at it. But usually our platform with more content and concerts in a market helps us get there. And then sponsorships ends up being, again, mostly a people business. If we have the right festivals, the right assets and the right digital pieces, then our ad team can continue to create better value for our clients. So we have a complicated model, but it's really simple. The more people that walk in the door and the more concerts we put on, means the more tickets we sell, the bigger our fan base is, which means we have more advertising opportunity. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Got you. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. I just had one question. You said your priority was to consolidate and scale the Global business and I was just wondering if you could take a second and share with us anything that you see evolving or developing on the competitive front in terms of other players out in the marketplace trying to mimic what you're trying to build? Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thank you. Listen, I think one of the smartest things we've done for 10 years is have a very small to-do list and a big don't-do list. I think the reason we can sit here 10 years later with 70 million customers going to our shows and be a clear global leader is because we stayed to our knitting. We started in the same time, 10 years ago, with our competitors. We were all the same size. Some of them decided to \u2013 I don't know \u2013 go after NFL teams and et cetera. We stayed core to our business and that's why 10 years later we are the best in the world at what we do. We've attracted the best talent and we're going to keep making sure that we don't leave any opportunity to lose our position. I think the competitive set is probably more obviously in the ticketing space. You'll always see somebody with a new app or somebody's desire to try to replicate the TM model. Again, we think the combination of having Live Nation's content feeding Ticketmaster, Ticketmaster's incredible global position and scale around its commerce, and really, the reality of our real focus over the last three years to get the best talent in the world reengaged at Ticketmaster. When we took over Ticketmaster, we couldn't hire somebody from Amazon or Apple. We couldn't hire the best-in-class. Today, we can hire the best-in-class every day of the week, who understand now Ticketmaster is a revived new spirit with a great mission. Great technology people want great missions. We have a great mission at Ticketmaster : to evolve and become even better at helping the customer find a ticket and get to the show. And I think that's the place that's the most competitive. We see it when we're re-signing (31:49) clients. And we see it on the consumer front. So, I think if we continue to invest in great products and always continue to never lose sight of our core business, which is the more concerts we have, the more we can control and leverage our ecosystem, we're confident we can continue to grow all three businesses. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Maybe if I can just ask one follow-up, if someone like Stubhub in the secondary ticket market sort of went backwards and tried to acquire someone in the primary ticket market to replicate the model that you have, would you characterize that as a meaningful challenge? Or given the primary ticketing assets that are out there, sort of not that meaningful? Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, every action has a reaction. We assumed when we went from primary to adding secondary on our seat map that everybody scurried at Stubhub headquarters, and it's taken them this long to go, oh, crap, we better add primary to our seat map. So we predicted that was coming. I think I've said out loud many times that we welcome secondary and primary merging together. We think we're the beneficiary of that over time. So, we like the idea over time that there is one place to buy a ticket to the Beyonc\u00e9 show versus historically, there was a primary provider, who wasn't working with all of the same tools of secondary. So we think secondary \u2013 we think Stubhub has always been our main competitor in the U.S. It's not around the world. We like to remind everyone we have a global business in Ticketmaster. We're really growing strong throughout Europe. We're number one in secondary in most of the markets in Europe where Stubhub was late to the market, so we made sure that we didn't sit tight over in Europe, that we launched and are the leader now in most of the markets that we participate in. So, we're very confident that globally there is some regional players but we're the only global platform. And we assumed secondary providers will try to add some primary. And I think that does one great thing for us, the more we can convince \u2013 so think of what our biggest challenge to growth is, convincing primary to add secondary to the equation. So, letting the primary provider, when you meet with them, convincing them that it's okay to put primary and secondary at one offering for the fan, and I think every time that the market goes towards that, we win, because our client, the team, the artist, the more they get comfortable with seeing primary and secondary together, our market share grows. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Understood. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to David Joyce with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. I have just a couple of things. You mentioned that you've got 37 countries in which you have promotional activity. How many of those do you have ticketing at this point? Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : We have ticketing in 22 countries. It's not 100% overlapped, but it's probably 20 out of the 22 we have ticketing in, we do concerts in. So it's about 40 overall countries, and ticketing about half of them. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And you mentioned some new strategic sponsors that came in recently. Could you talk about how broad your activities are with them, anything interesting to drive the business model going forward? Are they multi-national in nature? What kind of duration do those have? Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. No, they tend to be multi-year and multi-millions of dollars global deals. We haven't announced all of them yet, which is why we haven't given you the exact details, but they tend to be new categories for us. A lot in the technology space we're finding is looking for ways to reach that millennial audience, and is finding our platform attractive for that. In our sponsorship group, one of the things that we've been doing over the past year is really ramping up category specialists. So, whereas traditionally, you had some core categories of your beer and consumer goods, obviously, financial services, automotive, we've hired a number of experts that understand in greater detail the business models of different segments, which lets us then go in on a more informed basis into the CMOs office at those companies, engage them on how the Live Nation platform of 63 million fans can deliver them some real value. And several of those have been coming to fruition here over the past few months. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : And you had also mentioned, about 25% of your ticketing now is done on mobile. Could you talk about your outlook for the evolution of going to new paperless ticketing throughout the industry? Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I mean I think our view is that the ticket is an ideal product to be on your phone. And it's really a matter of the adoption curve, which is impossible to exactly predict, but it is an eminently logical thing to be purchased on the phone, found on the phone, transferred to your friends, sold, used to get in. So, there is a number of things that we don't control on the consumer adoption curve, but we've been working hard with venues to make sure that they've got the ability to read those tickets when you show up with them. Obviously, there is a lot of things around, just people's use of the phones, and battery life and so on, but absolutely expect that to continue to grow, as how the millennial wants to interact to get there and manage their information. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : How should we think about the kind of investment that would be required on that? How would you share that with the venues? What efficiencies do you get out of going paperless? Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : So, I think in most of our ticketing venue deals right now, we're very much involved in the access control point, because we need to provide something that gets the person a ticket. I think that what it does, it ultimately just creates a much better fan experience. It increases conversion because the search and purchase process are easier, and it increases the certainty because there is no longer fake tickets when it's a digital right that is being transferred around. So I think it can move to a much more fan-friendly system, and better for the venues, better for content as well. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Please go ahead. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Thanks. Two questions on ticketing. First on, we've kind of beaten this around a little bit, but on the cost side, the 11% growth in direct operating costs in the quarter, is that primarily driven by royalties in the resale market, or international expansion or both? Then I've got a follow-up with Ticketmaster. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. It's going to be made up of all of the above. It's going to be made up in the royalty rates, both North America and internationally, mixed with our secondary business and just general higher operating costs as we continue to build the global teams. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then, Michael, you talked about landing another 150 venues in the quarter to Ticketmaster. How much of the new Ticketmaster platform is contributing to that? And what are the benefits that venues are seeing from the new platform? Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Sorry. This is Joe. Just to make sure we have the facts right, the 150 year-on-year, so since Q1 of last year the 150 additional clients, which are a combination of on the traditional Ticketmaster system as well as, again, as we've been focused on the specialty vertical, so things like our festival vertical has been very effective building, adding new customers as well. You want to talk about the TM one? Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Doug, we've talked just philosophically, I mean, again when we took Ticketmaster over, it had been losing customers. Renewal rate was down to 70%. Its EBITDA had declined 20% a year for the five years before that. So now you sit here with Ticketmaster, where its EBITDA has grown. We've had a record ticket selling month. And our renewal rates are over 100%. So, I believe that if you ask our clients, the number one reason that they'll tell you that the business \u2013 why they've renewed, why they've signed up, why they have a new appreciation for Ticketmaster is that, over the last few years we, for the first time in 20 years, were the management team that was serious about investing and upgrading the tools that would help them sell more tickets. So for a venue, you know we've shown you in the past the green screen they had, but today they have an iPad with an app that lets them price their own tickets, publish their own shows, instant ticket sale delivery. I mean there's multiple ways it's been enhanced and elevated. So absolutely; I would not be sitting here years later with a green screen telling you just because we have a few concerts at Live Nation we were able to fix the business. But the new platform, all the new tools we've been developing and modulely (41:58) delivering to our client over the last year, I think is the fundamental reason that the business is now excelling. And a lot of that development also gets shipped internationally, and the reason we're able to scale faster there and grow our business is, we are going to be, again, able to use the learning and some product development from America on our international expansion, which again, never happened in the old TM. They were very separate \u2013 14 separate platforms that shared no product development. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Got it. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Ben Mogil with Stifel. Please go ahead. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. So first one I think probably either for Michael or for Joe. We've certainly, I guess, some of the music labels have been talking about doing more in the sponsorship area, more 360 deals. Universal has talked some about Honda Stage (42:55). They've talked about that vis-\u00e0-vis Vevo as well. From a competitive perspective, how are you viewing them within the dynamic, it's a big pie obviously, but curious how you are viewing the labels within that dynamic right now? Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean we're not really in their business. I know they have a few sales guys trying to sell some IP. But at the core are, again, going back to our priority, our focus, the reason we have 900 sponsors, if we surveyed them tomorrow, 899 of them would tell you, because we have incredible on-site customer reach. We are the 70 million customers, we're bigger than the NFL, NBA. So most of our advertising always has been driven by, we have an incredible ability to reach on a Thursday night, in seat seven, a customer specific. When you added on Ticketmaster and we've started to get really rich in data about that customer, our business started to grow. When we then added on digital platform, an ability to say to a sponsor, we can deliver you on-site, and we can amplify that connection digitally, our business grew. So our core business, the customers, the brands that are looking to partner with us, that's a competitive proposition that we have. There has always been Vevo and MTV and many other digital video play auctions for brands, and some of them continue to do well, and the pie is big. But we see huge opportunity and we're the only one with 70 million or end-level of scale on site and added 66 million monthly digital customers. Nobody has that one-two punch to deliver to an advertiser. So we think there will be many playing on smaller scale on-site. There will be many playing on digital, even with bigger footprints, but the brands that want on-site meets on-line, we're the best opportunity for that. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's very fair. Thank you, Michael. And then probably a Kathy question. Thank you very much for the commentary on ticketing in terms of margins and what to expect for this year and what the non-recoups look like. On that sort of roughly $80 million, $82 million of non-recoups that you'll do here in the amortization line, how much of that is actually cash? Kathy Willard - Chief Financial Officer : So, obviously, the cash is paid for contract through generally three years to five years. And at this point with that history cash is basically equivalent to expense. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And so, basically we've seen flat to the last year, so the year-over-year cash outflow and your cash flow from ops is basically pretty nil. Is that a reasonable way to look at it? Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's essentially steady-state by this point in the history. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's great. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Brandon Ross with BTIG. Please go ahead. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on the investments you guys have done in your ticketing technology. I was wondering if you could talk about where the technology in your established international ticketing business stands relative to domestic? And assuming it's behind, what kind of investment you need to make from here in that established international business to catch it up to the domestic business? And wanted to confirm that you guys have completed the re-platforming and major upgrades in the domestic ticketing business? Thanks. Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I'll start with the second and work backwards. So, on one level, yes, we've completed the re-platforming. We've completed the work that we set out to do in 2011. As we've talked on other calls in the process what we learned about Ticketmaster is, it's a true technology company and it's a company that is going to be very much driven by the products that it creates for its venue clients, which, as Michael talked, are critical to our being the best ticketing platform to sell tickets for them and it's critical for fans they seem to drive that conversion rate, to drive the discovery to continue to sell the tickets. So we see, going forward, if we looked at our Ticketmaster system as a technology business so we'll continue to invest in those production. Now, as you note, we started with North America. A lot of that technology both at the website level as well as at the app for fan-facing and then also venue-facing has already been brought over to the U.K., Ireland and Australia, which use the same core underlying system that we've historically called the host system. Continental Europe is largely on a different system. That system already has a great deal more flexibility than what the historical host system had, but it is something that over the next couple of years we'll be looking to migrate a lot of the functionality. Again because we've built this in such a modular fashion, there's not a big bang, turn off one system, turn off the other. It's a matter of replacing components over time. We don't see a substantial shift from our current run rate of CapEx at Ticketmaster or CapEx as a percentage of our revenue to substantially deviate. And we think we can get it done within those spend levels. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : And how long do you think it's going to take to get to a real peak margin at Ticketmaster? Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer : Well I think I talked about that earlier, which is the focus over the next few years is on driving the market share and the revenue and the AOI growth. So separate out what's the exactness of one piece of Ticketmaster, the operating model and how we're driving down our cost structure, which we are doing, with the fact that as we build other verticals those are inherently lower scale, often have different fee structures, and maybe lower margin yet faster growing. As we go into new international markets, with whatever system we deploy we're likely to start in those new markets at a lower scale, which is going to have some higher fixed cost associated with it. So our number one objective is to drive the cash side of the business because we absolutely believe that what matters most to our shareholders at the end of the day is the cash we generate. And we will take higher growth with more cash over shrinking to maximize the margin. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session. At this time I'd like to turn the conference back over to your presenters for any additional and/or closing comments. Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, everybody. We'll talk to you in Q2. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino : Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2016 conference call. Live Nation accelerated growth in the second quarter with revenue up 23%, AOI up 28%, free cash flow up 22%. Each of our core businesses concerts, advertising and ticketing contributed to this strong performance with revenue and AOI up double digits in each business. Our concerts business is our flywheel, attracting 19 million fans to shows this quarter, which in turn also drove AOI growth in our ticketing, advertising and on-site businesses. We have built the industry's most scalable and unparalleled live platform, bringing over 500 million fans in 40 countries to live events each year. With concert ticketing sales running well ahead of last year, we are confident that 2016 will be another record year of results for Live Nation overall and for each of its core divisions. Starting with the concerts business, through mid-July we have sold over 50 million tickets for our concerts that take place this year, pacing 17% ahead of last year this point. As a result, in the second quarter we grew revenue by 26% and AOI by 81% in each our core business. We continue to be the leading promoter in the world, having created a business model that is effective at attracting artists from the club to the stadium level, enabling us to then make money in our high margin on-site, ticketing and advertising businesses. This year we are growing our concerts business across all channels, with an 18% increase in confirmed shows in stadium, arena and amphitheater while also adding more festivals to our portfolio and continuing to expand our club and theater business. This growth is being delivered both in North America and internationally with concerts and festivals projecting mid-to-high single digit growth in fan attendance for the full year. At the same time, we are seeing the benefits from improving the on-site fan experience. For the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in net revenue per fan at our amphitheaters, increasing our contribution margin by over $2 per fan. Coming on top of last year's growth of $0.80 per fan, we are seeing the results from improving our food and beverage offering and expanding our products to provide more options for high-end customers. And our artist management business continued to be strategic to our overall business, providing a strong pipeline of shows and supporting our growth initiatives. In the sponsorship & advertising business, we continued to see strong growth for the quarter with revenue up 17% and AOI up 12%. Live Nation's ongoing success in growing its high margin advertising business is based on its unique scale and breadth in the live experience space. No other advertising platform can match our 60 million on-site engaged fans along with 80 million monthly unique visitors to our websites, and over 500 million direct connections with fans attending events each year. From festivals to branded content to exclusive access to tickets and events, the combined Live Nation concerts and Ticketmaster platforms reached an audience at a level no other music or online company can match. As a result through mid-July contracted net revenue is up 16% and we have sold over 85% of our planned advertising inventory for the year. And because of our platform's unique positioning and demonstrated effectiveness, our Live Nation sponsors continue to renew and expand their commitment to our platform. As of the end of the second quarter, we had roughly 50 sponsors projected to spend over $1 million with us this year, with a cumulative spend growth of 18% to over 200 million for the year. With both sponsorship and online advertising increasing year-on-year, a strong pipeline of committed business, at this point we are confident that we will deliver AOI growth this year consistent with the past several years. Ticketmaster continues to be the leading global ticketing marketplace for the 25 billion in total GTV annually for all of its ticket processed. And after adding five more countries this quarter we offer it in 27 countries worldwide. This quarter we extended our leadership to 14% growth and total GTV of 5.7 billion, an overall Ticketmaster revenue growth of 23% and AOI growth of 20% for the quarter. Our secondary product has delivered GTV growth of over 20% for the ninth consecutive quarter, and it is up 49% year-on-year in the second quarter, to over 300 million. One key component for continuing Ticketmaster's growth is the opening of our marketplace to sell tickets on other distribution platforms, driving increased conversion and tapping into additional fan bases. Through the deployment of APIs with key partners such as Facebook, BandsinTown and Broadway.com, and Groupon we've increased sales by 30% in the first half to more than 5 million tickets. Going forward, we see these and other distribution partners, including teams and artists, as a key way to extend our reach and increase flexibility of our clients and continue selling more tickets powered by Ticketmaster. Underlying this success is the continued expansion of our venue client base. During the quarter, we added nearly 400 new clients globally, making us confident that for the seventh consecutive year we will have a net renewal rate of over 100%. With the TM ONE software platform in full rollout, we are delivering an improved workflow for the venues while at the same time selling more tickets, pricing them better, and reducing Ticketmaster's cost base. As a result of all this, in 2016 we have already had five of the top ten GTV months globally in Ticketmaster's history. As well as Ticketmaster has done this year, I have even greater expectations going forward. Every one of our ticketing verticals has tremendous runway for growth. We now have a technology platform which enables us to deploy web and app products faster and more flexible, and opening our platform is powering even more sales. This, combined with a strengthening value proposition to our growing base of venue clients, positions Ticketmaster for ongoing growth. After our strong performance in the first half of the year, we expect 2016 to be another year of record growth and record results for the company. Based on our key indicators in concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, we expect revenue and AOI growth in each of these businesses and overall for Live Nation this year. With that I'll turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional detail on divisional performance. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first Concerts. Live Nation Concerts revenue in the second quarter was up 26% and AOI was up 61%. The revenue growth was driven by a 22% increase in attendance for the quarter led by stadium and amphitheater shows. Stadium attendance was six times than in the second quarter of last year with almost 3.5 million fans attending 83 shows in what is shaping up to be our largest stadium year ever. Amphitheater attendance was up 17% to almost 4.5 million fans. And while both North America and international attendance were up double-digits, international growth was particularly strong at 45% for the quarter. And looking forward to the second half as Michael said ticket sales for shows this year are up 17% through July 18th and we've already sold over 50 million tickets for shows this year. Our pipeline of shows in the second half particularly stadiums and arenas that are covering all groups including amphitheater, clubs and theaters and festivals continues to be very strong and we expect to increase our show counts for about 26,000 this year. Given the line of shows are larger venues this year we're confident that we'll deliver high single digit attendance growth for the year. And as Michael also mentioned the success we've had growing per cap profitability at the amphitheaters this year, this growth was led by increased concession sales but also benefiting from higher parking, service charge and merchandise revenue as we continue optimizing revenue per fan. On concession, we worked with legends to improve the overall offer and introduce new concept such as grab and go stands while expanding our high end offers with dedicated wine bars and improved VIP rooms. With this momentum across the Board, we expect continued strong growth in our concerts AOI for the year. At Artist Nation, revenue was flat and AOI improved slightly in the second quarter and we expect similar trends for the full year. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business, ad revenue was up for the second quarter by 17% and AOI grew by 12% continuing its strong performance from the first quarter and growing double digits comping against the very strong growth in the Q2 of last year. The second quarter growth was waged sponsorship this quarter with AOI up 14% driven by new strategic sponsors, increased activity with existing sponsors and increased festival activity. Online advertising is also continuing its steady growth within AOI increase of 7%. At this point with over 275 million in sponsorship and advertising net revenue now contracted for the year, we're confident we will deliver AOI growth consistent with the past few years. Finally, Ticketmaster, for the quarter Ticketmaster revenue was up 23% and AOI up 20%, primary ticketing fee bearing GTV for the quarter was up 20%, strong concerts activity accounted for the majority of our increase in the quarter and growth was strong globally with North America up 26% and international up 5%. Secondary GTV was up 49% for the quarter with growth of 48% in North America and 58% in international markets. The business continues to benefit from our strategy of aligning with content providing fans with their full set of choices with transparency. As a result, we're continuing to see much high conversion rates on integrated inventory events than those with primary only options up now to 50% higher for the first half of this year. And we remain focused on great [ph] rate band product, key amongst these as delivering the best mobile experience for fans. From our continued lab and app improvements, we've increased mobile sales by 47% this quarter year-over-year, now accounting for 27% in overall ticket sales. And given the ticket pipeline and momentum we have in secondary ticketing to the full year, we expect to deliver a high single digit AOI growth with flat year-over-year margin. In summary now more than half ways for the year, we're confident that 2016 will be another year of record top line and bottom line results overall and for each of our core businesses. We also expect record pre-cash flow with AOI conversion into free cash at about the same rate as last year. From a time perspective, we ended up heavier weighted into Q2 from both concerts and ticketing perspective and we thought at the start of the quarter and at this time expect most of our remaining growth for the year to come in the third quarter. On FX during the second quarter, we continue to see a 1% to 2% impact on our revenue and AOI with Q2's impact largely coming from the pound dollar devaluation in the period. If the current forecast of the FX rates hold true, the total FX impact this year would continue in the 1% to 2% for both revenue and AOI. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard : Thanks Joe and good afternoon everyone. I will start with our results for the second quarter. Revenue was up 23% to 2.2 billion and AOI of 28% to 181 million. On a constant-currency basis revenue was 2.2 billion and AOI was 183 million. And free cash flow was 113 million for the quarter, an increase of 22%. Our Concerts deferred revenue for tickets sold for events in the future at our owned or operated venues is one of our most important leading financial indicators. And as of the end of the second quarter, our deferred revenue was 1.2 billion, an increase of 12% over the 1 billion in June of last year. The majority of our revenue growth in the second quarter was driven by significant stadium and amphitheater activity concerts and higher primary and resale volume in ticketing. This growth in concerts and ticketing also largely drove the 28% increase in AOI over last year. Our operating income in the second quarter was 74 million. 76% higher than the 42 million we reported last year driven by the increase in AOI. And our net income for the quarter was 38 million compared to 15 million in the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter our other expense included net foreign exchange rate losses from revaluation of 7 million compared to 2015 which included a gain related to acquisitions of 10 million. Moving to the results for the first half of the year, revenue was up 17% to 3.4 billion and AOI up 20% to 254 million. On a constant-currency basis revenue was 3.4 billion and AOI was 257 million. And free cash flow was 123 million, an increase of 5% over last year. The majority of our revenue growth was driven by concerts largely from the increase in the number of stadium shows in North America and Europe as well as strong attendance growth in our amphitheaters. Ticketing revenue for the first half of the year was up from increased primary as well as resale volume. And sponsorship and advertising revenue was 15% as we continue signing new clients, growing our online business and increasing festival sponsorship. The 20% growth in reported AOI for the first half of 2016 was largely from our strong concerts activity and ticketing volume. All of our segments delivered growth in AOI during the first six months. Operating income was 41 million versus 80 million in the first half of 2015 driven by the increase in AOI. And our net loss for the first half was 7 million, an improvement from the net loss of 43 million last year. For the six months our other expense included net foreign exchange rate gains from revaluation of 1 million compared to 2015 which had net foreign exchange rate losses of 21 million. For the full year we currently estimate that we will record 50 million of accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest which impacts the calculation of earnings per share. This accretion is related to certain put/call arrangements from completed acquisitions where the value of the put is recognized over time to APIC. And finally we currently expect the amortization of non-receivable ticketing contract advances for 2016 to be in line with the total amount in 2015. Moving to our balance sheet, as of June 30, we had total cash of 1.5 billion, including 606 million in ticketing client cash and 759 million in net concert event related cash leaving a free cash balance of 148 million. Cash flow from operations was 511 million compared to 362 million in the first half of 2015, with the increase driven by our higher event related deferred revenue and AOI growth. Free cash flow was 123 million in the first half of 2016 as compared to 170 million last year. This increase came from our higher AOI, less increase maintenance CapEx and timing of distributions to our partners. As Joe mentioned, for full your 2015 we currently expect our free cash flow as a percentage of AOI to be similar to what it was in 2015. Our total capital expenditures were 77 million for the first six months with approximately half of that on revenue generating items. We currently expect total capital expenditures to be approximately 175 million to 180 million for the full year in 2016 in line with our previous guidance of about 2% of revenue with about 60% of that overall spend to be spent on revenue generating CapEx. As of June 30th, our total net debt was 2 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3%. Thank you for joining us today and we will now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, we will take our first question from John Janedis with Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : Martha [ph] on for John. Just wanted to talk about international strategy, you've bought Big Concerts earlier this year and then ticket hour earlier this year, given the scale, do these allow you to enter adjacent countries or regions and are the economics of sport ticketing different outside of the U.S.? Thank you. Michael Rapino : So the Big Concerts again would just be what we've been doing for many years in the major cities around the world that are now becoming ongoing regular places for big artist to tour, we want to make sure that we have a local office so we can capture all of the revenue and economics when that tour comes to town. So Big Concerts in South Africa or Cape Town, has been the leader forever and one of our partners and now we are able do a deal where we can put our proper base Live Nation business there and now build out the [indiscernible] of ticking and sponsorship. So you'll see that happening over the year, you\u2019ll see that continue to happen where we look for the leading promoter number one or two in that market and then use our scale to accelerate that business and make it an accretive acquisition. Ticket hour is almost an acqui-hire [ph] in the sense, it brought some advanced ticket sport software to our international business same economics over here in America and the servicing obviously the soccer leagues versus the pro sports here. And we were little void in our software in terms of sport over there, so this helped us to plug a whole and provide us a better overall solution for our soccer leagues in Europe. Operator : We'll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong : Thanks. Two questions. So first on the revenue per fan contribution, it looks like it more than doubled. Do you think it could double again in the next 12 to 24 months? Where do you think it could go and does it ultimately expand concert margins? And my second question is on this digital opportunities that you have laid out. You now have Yahoo!, Vice, it looks like you are partnering up with Hulu on the VR front and I was just wondering how big you think these deals could be ultimately? Michael Rapino : I mean on the onsite I mean was not given in the guidance or exact mix here, but I think we've said out loud from our different presentations that we think is going onsite is a huge opportunity. We've been underdeveloped versus kind of the best in the league, we looked at the sports companies and different venues we've showed in the past. So, yes, we think that we have huge opportunity to keep growing our per head revenue business or CM business annually for the next many years to come because we think we'll probably at the lower end on a per head versus most of the sports leagues here in Europe and as we invest in higher end lines, better products, grab and go stores that we have now onsite, better VIP hospitality we're seeing that continually tick in to that $2 that we reported today. So, we think growth will continue for multiple years on onsite CM as we excel our offering. Digital, you and I have talked, Amy, about the digital overall. The digital is just a continual expansion of the ad unit for our business. And the reason we've been able to continually grow our core advertising sponsorship business for the last multiple years is we want to keep offering our sponsors a wide variety of onsite to kind of online offering. So, having more originally I think it was Yahoo! when we started. Having more ways that we're distributing content on a digital basis, from Snapchat to Hulu to VR, using all of the different distribution arms as kind of the publisher of that live experience. We think that it'll be a key foundation of ad unit to keep given our double-digit growth in our core sponsorship advertising business. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet : I just had two questions. Maybe the market is just grasping for things to get excited about as it relates to VR but as a layman, this seems like a very big opportunity, but it seems if I'm interpreting your rhetoric correctly more as just sort of a modest -- not a big monetization driver going forward. I was wondering if you could just explain that because it seems like it could be big, but you don't seem to share that view. My second question is on the $150 million on-site revenue opportunity you guys have cited for the next few years, can you just put a little bit of color around what has to happen? In other words, is it infrastructure that has to get put in your on-site facilities? Is it vendors that need to get swapped out? What is it that is happening behind the scenes that causes that ramp to happen? How much of it is in place today? Michael Rapino : I think specifically to your VR, listen, we believe at the core why our business is growing and it's going to have a long run way of growth is experiential onsite is the magic. So, the 22 year old that's going to Lollapalooza this weekend or the 52 year old going to Guns N' Roses reunion this weekend is a magical moment and it's much like going on vacation is lot better than watching a video. So, we do believe that the moat around the castle and the most advantaged kind of offering we have is our scale in live and live experiential, on-site where you get the goose bumps, you experience with your friends and make those Kodak moment, has huge opportunity forward for us. Now of course when virtual VR comes, can we do better ways to bringing the guns and roses show to you in your living room in a more dynamic mechanism than a DVD or a current TV? Sure, and we think those will be great ways to distribute that show make it into some content and help us deliver some advertising. But I had not been, even been in big proponent who is going to convince you that anyway we're going to that take Guns and Roses and have a big up sell at home pay per view or selling that to our show, no matter how dynamic it is on its own. I think it is a great content to extent the show first and foremost the biggest advantage to us is it helps us sell more tickets to the later shows and delivers it some advertising reach and scale beyond the onset. So I think it's great, I think it's great for the industry, will be incredible, ad unit, will be incredible way to sell the concert experience. But most of the monetization is always going to be connected to the onsite. Joe Berchtold : And Jason just to the second point on the $150 million of incremental onsite revenue, again to dimensionalize that there is roughly 30 million fans sending our amphitheaters festivals, theaters and clubs so we're talking about roughly $5 per fan incremental revenue from the numbers that Michael gave you fairly with our amphitheater through the type of products introductions that we've made, we\u2019re well on our way in terms of making progress again that number. And I think he also gave you a feel for the types of products that we need to be rolling out that give you a better experience for everybody on the food and beverage opportunity and then particularly at the high end to the provide VIPs experiences and just some higher end products that can be purchased. So none of these are big capital or big complexity in order to do, but there is just product developments and rollout and iterations against what products are working, which one aren't, taking the lessons that we've gotten from our amphitheater this summary and bringing those to festivals and theaters and clubs to get that overall $150 million number. Michael Rapino : To finish that up, I would say with our core kind of strategy that needed to be worked on was just a staffing of the skill set. So when we brought over [indiscernible], we kind of created an upper end vision that is focusing on as we kind of call -- we do a good job of getting 70 million into the venue, but just like first calls has come back on airline, we needed to have a decided unit innovatively best can practice thinking about the high end part of the business and bringing better products, creating products packages bundles, travel packages, tequila, et cetera. So first we just have to -- we needed to spend more time on the right skill set and this summer we're very excited about bunch of the program we're testing. Operator : We'll now go David Joyce with Evercore ISI. David Joyce : Couple of questions, first, related to your UK exposure, it was late in the second quarter when you had that Brexit surprise. What is that doing to the consumers or the fans from your perspective? The market is roughly 10% of your revenue? And then secondly, if we could discuss kind of what the opportunity is for the Tickethour acquisition. I know you mentioned you get some advance software from that they have but is there any plan as they roll out some of the Ticketmaster products onto what they are doing? Michael Rapino : So, on the first on the UK exposure we've seen zero impact on fan demand in the UK as it relates to the Brexit or any of those concerned. So, absolutely none and yes all of that happened late in the second quarter. But even our forward rates as I mentioned which show roughly flat to bit of decline in the pound still has us at the 1% to 2% for the year. So, we're not seeing anything in terms of either the demand or the translation economics that has us concerned at this point. In terms of Tickethour a 100% the plan is that the Tickethour is integrated into our European Ticketmaster operations and it is the backbone that serves the soccer, rugby and other major sports league through Europe. Again the counterpart to what we have in the U.S. that would serve football, basketball, hockey and so on. So, yes it is to be integrated within Ticketmaster. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Doug Arthur : Joe, you had such a blowout in the concert division in the second quarter and you made a comment that some of that may have stolen from the third quarter. I'm just trying to get a handle on your sense of momentum in the seasonally biggest quarter of the year. I mean obviously it is not going to be up 26% I assume on the top line. But is the pipeline still fairly robust going into the third quarter? I am just trying to get a better sense of what is going on. Joe Berchtold : 100%, we expect third quarter to be very strong, record third quarter for us. I think we simply just saw even part of it was Ticketmaster on sale timing even stronger in Q2 than we expected and part of it is just some of our show timing. So, nothing that would be a lost momentum going into Q3, you can tell from some of our numbers that where we're at today in terms of sold versus the guidance we gave you on where we end up. But yes, still a very strong third quarter. Doug Arthur : And just as a corollary, I mean historically there has been some linkage between strong touring activities in Artist Nation at least on the merchandise side and I know the business model there has changed. But how come Artist Nation can't kind of kick into gear here? Michael Rapino : It's really just I mean -- frankly in part a timing issue and when different tours are out as we saw bit of improvement this quarter, we'll see a bit more improvement we think continuing but it's not a scale business like our businesses are scale businesses, it's job shop business. So, when you make some of these improvements in the amphitheater and you have that then rolled out to 15 million people, we just see a very different scale of impact than you see in a job shop type environment. Operator : We'll go now to John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Joe, I just wanted to kind of ask a question about the outlook that you guys provided. When I look at the commentary regarding the outlook for the concert business I think previously in the supplemental you were talking to double-digit growth in concert AOI and the verbiage changed a little bit. I don't want to be too nitpicky but was just wondering compared to what you felt about the concert business three months ago, has your outlook gotten or better, stayed the same, gotten a little bit worse? Just trying to understand the overall feel on the back of the strong 2Q that you had? Joe Berchtold : I think the overall feel is very optimist, very positive, feel better now than we did three year months, it's been a very great Q2 and we expect the great Q3. John Healy : Okay. Great, and I just wanted to ask on the Artist Nation side of things, you talked a couple of quarters ago about getting a little bit more visible on the sports side of the business. I was just kind of curious to know how that initiative is progressing and with that initiative, is that one of the reasons we are not maybe seeing the Artist Nation AOI kind of pick up? Is there a decent amount of spend there? I'm just trying to understand a little bit more just what is going on with the cost structure there? Joe Berchtold : It's going very well in terms of the Artists that are being signed and we\u2019ve had some great successes some of the headlines clients like the Kevin Durants. It is not a cheap business to enter and the economics do come overtime in that one. So absolutely that would be a piece of what would be muting some of the overall Artists Nation performance. Operator : And we'll take question from Rich Tullo from AFCO. Rich Tullo : Congratulations on the quarter, it looks like things are really humming in the concert industry. In terms of geopolitical, it doesn't look like you are seeing any influence by what is going on. Is that the case or is it the U.S. is just very robust right now? Michael Rapino : I think you're right Rich, at this point, we are seeing very robust demands still globally, it's been various events going on around the world on a political and otherwise standpoint, but thus far we haven't seen any impact on our demand, current show, shows down the road of the on sale and really nothing that we can discern. Rich Tullo : And then by genre, is there anything moving the bar and taking over from something that was strong last year just to get a feel for how it is going? Michael Rapino : Our philosophy is that we believe we're operating a level. We're going to be number one in all of the genre and our other markets we operate in across all types of buildings. So we haven't any major shifts in genre, we continue to see a very wide set of genres continuing to have strong demand from EDM to country to pop to hip hop to classic rock, but really nothing that has shifted dramatically recently. Rich Tullo : And then in terms of digital, how should we be looking at the opportunity set over the next couple of years? Is it the same type of opportunity set with partnerships with groups such as Vice and Yahoo which is now part of Verizon or do you think that there is something else to do? Michael Rapino : We think we've making strong measured progress in our mission. Our mission is, we have 25,000 shows in all of these festivals occurring, can you create content and distribute it and publish it to the growing distribution platforms, one to drive your core business and two to achieve some new ad units. And we think we've been making great progress with lots of different partners, we'll continue to see announcements that say we're going to stream these 20 shows on this platform or do VR on that platform or create some behind the scenes document commentary on online to Facebook's, to Twitter's etc. So, I think you'll see more the same I think the progress was made is that we're very credible now with most distributors. Most distributors want to meet with us and talk about can we bring that great live content to our platform with either being a live stream or behind the scenes or live documentaries or artist interviews, access behind the scenes at festivals. So, I think we've been moving very nicely and we're very pleased with our progress and we'll continue to do more content on platforms and drive more advertising. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Ben Mogil with Stifel. Ben Mogil : So one on the business and one on the numbers. On the business, given some of the geopolitical issues that are going on out there, are you seeing any kind of change in insurance costs at the venues that you either own or operate, are you seeing any kind of need for greater staffing? I'm kind of curious if you are seeing that change at this point in time? Joe Berchtold : This is Joe. First of all in terms of the insurance that's all down the road, if anything certainly we've got our policies in place now for this year and haven't seen changes for this year, but that's all to be determined. In terms of our security it\u2019s certainly a priority for us as we think about our fans and our staff and our artists and making sure we've got the right security in place. So, it's been a bigger area of focus. We obviously don't talk a lot about the specifics but certainly it's getting a lot more attention today than it did a year ago. And I think that you'll see various changes to the experience that will hopefully not be dramatic for the fans going to show, but we'll give everybody comfort that we're doing reasonable steps to protect everybody. Michael Rapino : And then just to jump on that I always like to remind people that there is a vast majority of shows we promote not in our venues. So, there's difference between when we own the amphitheater or festival and our internal security protocols and how we make sure we have metal detectors and et cetera, versus when we're promoting a show at someone else's venue. We have lots of the -- if you want to call it the security capital risk cost associated with that. So, a majority of the shows, the high percentage of the 25,000 shows are not within our venue network. So, we've two very different kind of strategies, one you can control and one you can't. Ben Mogil : But as you sort of go forward, is sort of how good or not good the venues ground security will be a bigger choice for you about whether to play that particular venue if you have got choices in the market kind of thing? Michael Rapino : I think we'll have -- venues will continue to elevate. We see lots of them doing a good job, but the good news is that's not our cost to bare and it's just our charge to decide where to put the artist. Ben Mogil : And then on the numbers, so very good revenue growth at ticketing, but a bit of margin compression. Was there anything in the quarter either in the mix or anything that you wanted to call out about that? Joe Berchtold : Well, as in just a mix and timing issue and we called out that we expect flat margins for the full year. So, that -- you can expect then it'll come back over next few quarters. Operator : And we'll now take the question from Brandon Ross with BTIG. Brandon Ross : Thank you for taking the questions. A couple of questions. One on margins in general and I guess Ben brought this up in the last question, but with the ticketing and sponsorship top lines growing so-so much this quarter, why aren't you seeing more leverage at each of them even with the couple of subscale ticketing platforms that you purchased? And then secondly, I know you had originally expected all the international ticketing would be on one platform by now. When should we expect that and to catch up to the work you have done in ticketing in the U.S. internationally and is this critical to your scaling into new international markets? Thank you very much. Michael Rapino : I'll answer the second first on the backward, on our international ticketing, we actually have the most important market in international the UK and Australia and Canada. They are all -- have always been and are on the close platform, so they are on the business and that's where at the end of the day most of our business is centered and where we want to share and extrapolate all of our cost and product development. When you get to decision like staying, where you're running a separate platform over to the very small piece of your business those urgency to take get on one platform are not on our list right now, they're running local currency. Most of the Europeans are on still retail system where you're buying tickets at the bank or the shopping mall a very retail oriented, not years behind kind of where we're today. So our priority has always has been the big markets like the UK, Canada, Australia to leverage our product development which we have been doing. We've had great growth in the UK over the last few years. And most important what was the priority was to make sure we excel the secondary in the European markets, unlike Ticketmaster in its prior life who waited too long and they have to play catch up. So our biggest priority in international was when we acquired Seatwave and with our GetMe product which integrates secondary and now 9 plus countries where we're now the market leader in the secondary business over there and are very proud of that. So our strategy is in the big markets internationally. They are sharing product innovation and underlying to our current strategy around primary and secondary. The slower markets overtime will look to integrate them into global platform, but those will be minimal upside from a cost advantage in the near term. Brandon Ross : What about new markets? Sorry to cut you off, Joe. What about moving into new markets? What is the strategy for that and does any of the re-platforming work that you have to do internationally play a role in that? Michael Rapino : I mean international is like concert business. You only -- right now international is always going to be one or two people that are already the leaders. So you may acquire somebody not because you're so much interested in their platform, but you just acquiring the cost of the contracts and the customers. So historically when we have looked into extension, we may acquire a company just if that's the quickest way to get scale and ticket inventory. We can rollout -- our current platform, we can rollout into a new market today. We don\u2019t typically tough right now look at a new market and enter with our new platform if we don't have tickets scale behind it. So, our short term strategy in international when we took over and continued to be -- Ticketmaster was in, I think when we took over \u201914-\u201915 markets. Our goal was to get into the European markets where we had scale and start matching up concerts, inventory with Ticketmaster platform and then step two grow market share in those markets and that's where we've been and that's where we'll see the fruit kind of bear from the tree for the next few years on growing our market share in Spain and Italy and France and Germany, where we have already got content versus obsessing whether we're in a new market or not right now. Brandon Ross : Great and then on the margins? Joe Berchtold : So, first off, just as a reminder as we've talked in the past, our number one obsession is driving the cash generation of the business and delving [ph] how much we're generating for our shareholders. We obviously pay attention to margins and focus on return on capital, but number one is the cash generation for the machine we have. So, I think the two business is on the sponsorship side again strong double-digit growth this year against 25% growth in Q2 last year. So comping on a very difficult comp. A couple of things, we drove a good chunk of that growth. One was an expansion of branded content creation by that division. So, we are working with brands, sponsors and a good chunk of what we're doing is creating content that is their brand integrated into it. That is a lower margin sponsorship product. Still very profitable for us but lower margin. Another piece of activity that we have in Q2 that we've been building over the course of the past year is with our festivals in addition to our payment for sponsorship is not providing activation onsite for additional payment from our sponsors. Again this is a lower margin activity because we've got the feet on the street that are doing the activation, but remains very profitable for us. So, that took a couple of points off the sponsorship business. Again stay mid to high 60s margin business for the growing cash generation. On the ticketing side first of all as I said to Ben part of it is timing, and the other part of it is we have discussed before is that while the traditional was host, now Jetsam [ph] chunk of our business is improved, economics, improve margin, there are a number of other specialty verticals that we've been in that tend for various reasons to have a lower margin profile as those grow faster than the traditional business that just has a counter balance for the margins that we've seen improved with Jetsam. All of which has led to substantial cash improvement at Ticketmaster, but doesn't come through in the margin specifically. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session and this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Live Nation had a record third quarter and 2016 is on track to deliver another year of record results across revenue, AOI, and free cash flow. For the quarter, revenue was up 23%, AOI up 15% at constant currency, and free cash flow up 21%. Our core divisions of concerts, ticketing, and Advertising, each delivered their strongest quarterly AOI results ever. Our concerts business is our flywheel, attracting 28 million fans to shows globally in the quarter, which drove record results in our ticketing, Advertising and on-site businesses. Our performance demonstrates how Live Nation has created the most unparalleled live platform, leveraging concert scale to drive growth across the full Live ecosystem. Our concert and ticketing sales continue to pace well ahead of last year and this give us confidence that 2016 would be another year of record results for Live Nation overall and for each of the core divisions. Looking at the concerts flywheel in the third quarter, we had 16% more fans attend over 6,000 shows, growing revenue by 27% and AOI by 38% year-on-year at a constant currency. Year-to-date, we have grown our fan base by 16% to 56 million on our way to we expect to be a record-setting 70 million fans attending Live Nation concerts in 2016. As we have discussed, increasing on-site monetization has been a major focus and year-to-date, we have increased average per spend at our festivals and amphitheaters by 10%, while growing attendance 13% at these events, thereby increasing total on-site spend by $70 million at constant currency. This high-margin spend has been a key driver of our growth concerts profitability in 2016. We have also benefited from ticket pricing initiatives; notably increasing the price on the most attractive tickets; and as a result, our average ticket price grew by 7% year-to-date. In our high-end margin Sponsorship business, we have continued to double-digit growth this year with revenue up 13% and AOI up 10% year-to-date at constant currency. The core of our Sponsorship and advertisement business is the ability to reach those 70 million fans attending Live Nation shows this year, now at a scale greater than the NFL, NBA and NHL combined. With over 27 million of these fans in the hard to reach 18- to 34-year-old demographic, we provide a unique platform for brands looking to drive engagement and activation. From this base of live fans, we leverage our database profiling nearly 300 million fans to help brands more effectively target potential customers. And on top of that, we have built our ad platform of streaming live concerts and creating content around our festivals and shows. So far this year, we have generated 3 billion views across Live Nation sites and platform partners including Snapchat, Facebook and YouTube, growing our ad units and providing brands with an amplified way to reach potential customers. Our platform is proving particularly attractive to those global brands looking to reach customers at scale, and through the third quarter, the 50-plus brands that spend over $1 million a year with us have increased their collective spend by 19% to over $225 million, which now account for 75% of our Sponsorship revenue. As a result, our contracted net revenue for the year is up 12% through October and over 95% of our planned Sponsorship under contract for the year. Given this, we are confidently we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth in our Sponsorship and Advertising business in 2016. Ticketmaster continues building its position as a global ticketing market leader with 14% growth year-to-date in global GTV to $19 billion on our way to over $27 billion for the year. Ticketmaster provides 480 million tickets to fans across 28 countries, making it by far the largest such marketplace. This has driven a 14% (sic) [12%] increase in ticketing revenue through the third quarter and a 9% increase in ticketing AOI. Investments in delivering an efficient mobile purchase process continue to improve the fan experience and year-to-date app installs are up 44% to nearly 30 million and mobile ticket sales up 38% to 27% of all ticket purchases. Similarly, our integrated secondary and primary ticketing output continues to benefit fans allowing them to see their options in one location, driving secondary GTV up 33% year-to-date to over $1 billion. With this success in selling tickets, Ticketmaster continues to attack new clients worldwide. This quarter we added 170 clients to our base of over 12,000, setting us up for the seventh consecutive year of growing ticket inventory. Going forward, we see attractive growth potential ticketing as we continue creating a new ticketing products, increasing conversion and expanding our reach with APIs through our third-party distributor commerce. In summary, we continue to rapidly grow our concert fan base, which is demonstrating the effectiveness of our flywheel, driving double-digit growth in Sponsorship, ticketing, and onsite. And as we look forward, we see tremendous opportunities to continue global consolidation of our concert business with further growth in onsite Advertising and ticketing. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through the additional details on the division performance. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments; first concerts. Live Nation concerts revenue in the third quarter was up 27%, and AOI was up 38% at constant currency. The revenue growth was driven by a 16% or 3.8 million fans increase in attendance for the quarter, with a 4% increase in show count and an 11% increase in attendance per show. Over our key summer months across Q2 and Q3, we increased fan attendance by over 7 million. Just this growth on a stand-alone basis would make us the third largest promoter in the world. Our growth was led by five artists performing to over 1 million fans each so far this year, including Beyonc\u00e9, Coldplay and Rihanna, all of whom performed both in the U.S. and internationally as we continue expanding the global terrain of our artists. And while our growth was led by stadium attendance of over 4 million fans so far this year, amphitheaters, arenas, festivals and theaters and clubs all increased their fan bases for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, North America drove much of the fan growth for the quarter with a very strong amphitheater business, so for the full year international fan growth continues to be over 20% year-on-year with strong growth across all building types. Looking to how we'll finish off the year in concerts, through October, ticket sales for shows this year are up 14% to over $61 million. And while we have a number of very strong tours in the fourth quarter and expect to get to 70 million total fans for the year, it does imply from a timing standpoint that the overall activity level in Q4 is a bit shifted into Q3 this year. As Michael discussed, we made great progress in growing our fan spending at the buildings we operate. Our U.S. amphitheater spending is up 10% to over $22 per fan. Our global festival spending is up a similar 10% to $17 per fan per day, all at constant currency. Collectively, these onsite initiatives in our fan growth has been the key drivers of our great concerts performance so far this year. Performance, we believe, will continue and be built upon in 2017 and beyond. At Artist Nation, revenue was up 11% and AOI down $1.4 million in the third quarter at constant currency. Based on artist touring timing, we now expect the fourth quarter and full year to be down from last year, but see a pickup in activity in 2017 as our management business continues to be a key strategic source through our concerts flywheel. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business, revenue for the third quarter grew by 10% and AOI was up 8% at constant currency. AOI in the quarter was impacted by a bad debt reserve, and without this AOI for the quarter would have been up 14%, and for the year up 13% at constant currency. Our Advertising growth this year has been well-balanced between Sponsorship and online Advertising, with both parts of the business growing contribution margin double-digits year-to-date. On the Sponsorship side 14% growth in festival Sponsorship continues to demonstrate the value our platform of 80 festivals worldwide provides the brands looking for direct engagement and activation with 18-year-old to 34-year-old fans. And on the online Advertising side, we're seeing the benefits from our breadth of content initiatives : live streaming, editorial content and other music related video as we've broadened our distribution channels to now include Snapchat, Facebook, NextVR, and Netflix. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster revenue was up 8% and AOI up 4% at constant currency. Primary, ticketing, fee-bearing GTV was up 10% for the quarter and is up 15% year-to-date at constant currency. The GTV growth has been driven primarily by our concerts and art segments, each of which is up approximately 20% year-to-date. Secondary ticketing GTV was up 13% for the quarter and is up 33% year-to-date at constant currency. Similarly, last year Q3 was our lowest growth quarter and we have already seen an acceleration of our growth through October as the NFL, NBA and 2017 concert on sales have kicked in. And with this North America and international GTV each remains up 30% or more through October. More broadly, the Ticketmaster platform has never been more effective at selling tickets for our clients. September was one of our top 10 GTV months ever, and five of our top 10 GTV months in our history have taken place this year. At the same time, we continue building the effectiveness of Ticketmaster as a sales partner for content by leveraging the customer base and traffic of distribution partners, including Facebook, Groupon and Bandsintown. We have more than doubled the volume of tickets sold in the quarter via our API, and year-to-date our channel partners have driven 34% more in ticket sales than this point last year to over 8 million tickets. With our expected on sales for 2017 concerts in the fourth quarter and it being our largest quarter for secondary, we expect to deliver double-digit GTV growth and high single-digit AOI growth for the full-year in ticketing, both at constant currency. In summary, we're confident that 2016 will be another year of record top-line and bottom-line results overall and for each of our core businesses. We also expect to continue growing our free cash flow, enabling us to continue investing in these businesses for ongoing growth. On FX, Q3 revenue and AOI were impacted by about 1% with a British pound turning sharply negative while other currencies were generally flat to slightly positive. In terms of seasonality, we expect Q4 as the percent of full-year AOI to be in the same general range it was in from 2011 to 2014. And looking at our earliest leading indicator for 2017, the number of booked stadium, arena and amphitheater shows were up double digit from this point last year pointing to continued success of our flywheel business model headed into 2017. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with our results for the third quarter. Revenue increased by 21% to $3.17 billion, and AOI was 14% higher than last year at $303 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue improved 23% to $3.22 billion, and AOI was $304 million, up 15% over last year. Free cash flow was $251 million for the quarter, an increase of 21% over the third quarter of 2015. As we entered the fourth quarter, our concerts deferred revenue for tickets sold for events in the future was $417 million as compared to $441 million in September last year. The majority of our revenue growth in the third quarter was driven by a 25% increase in concerts with a significant increase in stadium activity globally along with increased show count in both amphitheater and arenas shows in North America. Ticketing revenue was up 7% over last year with higher volume in both our primary and resale businesses. The growth in our concerts business also largely drove the 14% increase in AOI over last year. Operating income in the third quarter was $191 million, 25% higher than last year and net income for the quarter was $111 million, up 25% over the third quarter of 2015, both driven by the increase in AOI. Moving on to the results for the first nine months. Revenue was $6.56 billion, an increase of 19%, and AOI was up 17% to $557 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue improved by 21% to $6.65 billion,; and AOI was $562 million, an increase of 18%. Free cash was $373 million, 15% higher than last year. The majority of our revenue growth for the nine months was again driven by the concerts segment, which was up 23%, primarily from the increased activity across stadiums, arenas, and amphitheaters. Ticketing revenue for the nine months increased 12% with higher primary and resale volume. And Sponsorship & Advertising revenue was up 11% from new clients and renewals of existing partnerships. During the third quarter, as Joe mentioned, we recorded a bad debt reserve of $6 million related to a Sponsorship client going out of business, which reduced the year-over-year AOI growth for the nine months in the Sponsorship & Advertising segment by 3%. The 17% growth in AOI for the first nine months was primarily from the higher concerts activity and ticketing volume. All of our segments delivered growth in AOI during the period. Operating income was $232 million, an increase of 35% over last year, driven by the increase in AOI. Net income for the first nine months was $104 million, more than double the net income for the same period in 2015. This increase is largely driven by our higher AOI along with a net $14 million reduction in non-cash expenses related to foreign exchange impacts on certain balance sheet accounts and other write-offs as compared to last year. For the full year, we estimate that we will record approximately $50 million related to the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest from certain acquisition related put/call arrangements, which impacts the calculation of earnings per share. And finally, we expect the amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances for 2016 to be in line with the total amount in 2015. Moving to our balance sheet. As of September 30, we had total cash of $1 billion, which includes $547 million in ticketing client cash and $314 million in net concert event-related cash leaving a free cash balance of $179 million. Cash flow provided by operations was $120 million in the first nine months compared to a use of cash of $15 million in the same period of 2015. This increase was largely driven by higher operating results along with an improvement in net working capital. Free cash flow was $373 million in the nine-months period as compared to $325 million last year driven by our higher AOI, net of increases in maintenance CapEx and partner distribution. For full-year 2016, we currently expect our free cash flow as a percentage of AOI to be similar to what it was in 2015. For the nine months, total capital expenditures were $121 million with approximately half of that for revenue generating items. We currently expect total capital expenditures for the 2016 full-year to be approximately $180 million to $185 million with about 50% of that to be spent on revenue generating CapEx. As of September 30, our total debt was $2 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3%. In October, we refinanced our senior secured credit facility and 7% senior notes in order to take advantage of more favorable interest rates and terms. We issued $575 million, a 4.875% senior notes due in 2024 along with the new $190 million term loan A and a $975 million term loan B. The interest rate on our term loan B improved from LIBOR plus 2.75% per year with a LIBOR floor of 0.75% to LIBOR plus 2.5% with no floor. As to repayment of our existing senior secured credit facility and the 7% senior notes, along with related redemption premiums interest and fees, we added approximately $257 million of cash to our balance sheet for future investment in our business. We also increased our revolving line of credit from $335 million to $365 million, which remains undrawn. As a result, our annual cash interest expense will be reduced initially by approximately $2 million and our weighted average cost of debt will decrease from 4.3% to 3.8%. We will record a loss on extinguishment for this refinancing in the fourth quarter of 2016, which we currently estimate to be between $14 million and $17 million. Thank you for joining us today. And we will now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Two questions, first, on ancillary revenue. You're now largely through two seasons with Legends as your concession partner at some your North America amps. Can you give a sense for how far along you think you are driving higher net revenue per fan? And how much opportunity remains at the amphitheaters than maybe at some of your other venue types? And then secondly, your release mentioned that you've been able to increase prices for best seats at your concerts. In the past you mentioned that price in front of the house close in a market should allow you to lower prices for the back of the house, which should in theory increase attendance. Just wondering if this is dynamic you're seeing play out. Thanks. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I'll start and Joe can jump in. On the ticketing, I think it's a double strategy. I think we've kind of stated over the last few years that just generally getting better at dynamically pricing the house, the concert business historically had been a very simplistic pricing model three or four different tiers for the same concert and all the same markets. So we've been a big advocate over the last few years of pricing the house differently on a Friday night versus a Monday in New York versus Chicago and also adding as many different scaling to the house as you can through the purchase cycle. So we've done it on both sides. We had great success on the Groupon side and looking at the discounted lower end of the ticketing business and that's driven purchase. And we think we have the start of a huge opportunity as everyone talks about the VIP secondary $8 billion, all of those facts that are used that they're still a big piece of business that customers and scalpers are accessing through our content. So we think we have a lot of opportunity on the front end of the house to keep pricing it through VIP, Platinum, P1, so the artist can share in the upside versus the secondary business. And we think as we also lower and look at discounts and ways to price the bottom end of the house, we've been driving overall growth per show as well as ticket sales per show. So, both of them working as planned and we think the big runway still ahead of us is we know that there is still hundreds of millions of dollars in secondary ticket. Revenue on top of what we're charging for P1's to date that provides opportunity. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And David, this is Joe. On the ancillary, first of all, I mean, we've been very happy with Legends. They've done a great job ramping up and improving the offering to fans at our amphitheaters as we thought I think last year, with them getting their feet wet, making a few improvements. This year was really making those improvements at scale, experimenting at scale with wine bars, grab and go, craft beers, generally improved offering, and we've shown you the numbers from their doing that. That said, we absolutely believe we're still in the second, third inning of the improvements. I think we continue to benchmark ourselves against a well-performing ball club, and which extends the (23:22) per caps there in the $30 plus range and you see us in the $20s. And I think as we continue to improve the offer both for the mass offer, as well as continuing to target the VIP high-end people that want the great experience on the night out, that between those two areas we'll continue to be aggressive in driving the per cap spend over the next few years. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. We'll now move on to our next question from Ben Mogil with Stifel. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, I've got two of them. First one, so, Michael, in your prepared remarks, or actually I think in the press release, you talked about some of the extra artists payments that you were able to make to artists this year, sort of tied to the increase in ticket price, and sort of similar to what we hear companies sort of call out how much they're paying their suppliers. So, maybe you can frame that a little bit more for us, should we sort of assume that the splits that you have with the artists are unchanged, and that this increase is something that you're going to share in as well? Are you sort of trying to give a sense then of from a competitive positioning obviously the more money an artist gets the more likely they are to tour with you? I'm sort of curious around the commentary around the artist extra payments this year? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Nothing structural about the comment, nothing new on the splits. We absolutely like to remind the artist and the community that we spend over $3 billion to $4 billion a year paying the artists for their art. And I think as you've seen a lot of the other battles going on in the business, we've always believed that Live Nation could be an artist-centric, and having the artists aligned to our agenda has helped us grow the overall pie. But first and foremost, you have to pay the artist for his art. And that comment was just showing you, as we increase our business, the artist is doing well as well as our core business of growing our profitability. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's great. Thanks, Michael. And then one, I'm not sure for Michael or for Joe. On the ticketing, you certainly had nice growth in the secondary gross transaction value and it looks like kind of year-to-date you're in the same zip code as a StubHub in spite of (25:34) obviously, being significantly larger. So when you look at the secondary market, are you seeing the market grow and both of you are taking decent share? Maybe you can talk about the market growth as well as the competitive dynamics between the two of you and if there are any other players that you wanted to talk about as well? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I think absolutely the market continues to grow, but we're taking share. No question. And yes, StubHub is, I think this year, had reasonable growth coming off some issues they had last year. But our focus is really just our belief that if we give fans a great offer, if we give them a great product, and it all starts with that product, primary and secondary together, leveraging the scale that we have of people coming to Ticketmaster and our ability to reach those fans by direct marketing to them that we will continue to grow and take share regardless of what everybody else does in the market. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's great. Thanks, Michael. Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. We'll now move on to our next question from John Janedis with Jefferies. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Joe, your comments around bookings for 2017 were helpful given how strong this year has been to-date, and I guess the potential for next year to slow, so understanding you're not going to guide, is there any reason why bookings would come in significantly earlier for next year relative to this year? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, I think we're on a similar cycle as we were on last year. We just see a great pipeline of shows next year and wanted to make sure everybody understood that, that we didn't get some view that this year was unusual in the volume of activity that we had, and we're looking to enter next year very strongly. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then separately, I guess, given the ongoing currency and macro headlines, can you give us an update on your international M&A pipeline? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I love this, the simplistics of it. Yeah, let us lay it out for you. I think our pipeline on M&A continues to be, whether it's in America or international, we'll continue to look to build our scale in our core business. And whether it's a promoter in Nashville that can excel our business, a festival in America or in South America, we continue to look at promoters as well as festivals that can excel our inventory and that we can manage and build our flywheel around. So, we have an ongoing, always an ongoing active list, and we think we can continue to add a lot of bolt-ons that will continue to drive our overall scale at the right return. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take the next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Can I just go back to the per cap spending objectives? I think you guys have laid out this $5 per guest bogey. When you say you're in the second or third inning now, does that imply the we've sort of booked a $1 of that-ish so far off of that goal? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, no. Well, again, we've got a lot of fans. So, what we've done is in our amphitheaters and in our festivals, we grew at each of those about $2 per fan this year from the numbers I gave you. That represents roughly $15 million fans between those buildings that we operate where we have those initiatives with Legends on the amphitheater side and various folks on the festival side. So, I'm just speaking macro general terms. We've tested, we've tested at scale, we've delivered some results. There is now the opportunity to take to full rollout and scale some of those learnings as well as continue to increase the merchandise you were doing for all fans and a big step still to come in how we're delivering the experience on the VIP high-end. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Yeah, couple of questions. Looking at the margin in the concert business in the third quarter, obviously, that is a number that's moving up a lot, that's been one of your objectives, but the big number this quarter, how much of that is just sort of an extraordinary mix of tours out there this year and how much of it is sustainable? Then I have a follow-up. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. Well, obviously, we've had a very good season in our amphitheaters, Doug. And along with a lot of the... Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Did you get that, Doug? Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : I heard it. Yeah, I heard it. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think it was a record actually, but you've got to check those sources. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: But I'm sorry, joking aside, we talked about the on-site ancillary spend, a lot of that is higher margin spend in terms of how that flow through for us, so nothing extraordinary in terms of the talent or the splits or the payments or anything like that with \u2013 on the artist side, really I think you're seeing the pickup is more because of the ancillary growth than anything else. Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. So that sort of follows into \u2013 spills into my second question, which is we've kind of beaten around here a little bit, but your average revenue per attendee in this quarter approached almost $90 on average for all attendees. How much of that is a function of the mix in the quarter, because you had big stadium action in both Q2 and Q3 as opposed to the ticketing strategies and the ancillary or is it all the above? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, it's all the above clearly, but you can parse out, we've said it was a couple of dollars per fan on the ancillary. So, a lot of that is going to be your stadiums and then within the stadiums, the conversation we've been having about really focused on how we price, particularly the front of the house, capture the value to reduce the leakage that goes into the secondary that the artist doesn't benefit from, and that further takes that up; in stadiums, but also that takes place in amphitheatres and arenas. Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now move on to David Joyce with Evercore ISI. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. In terms of the better pricing of the house, how much further throughout your footprint are you are able to roll out those strategies and learnings? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I mean, let's leave the theater and clubs separate, but all amphitheater, arena and stadium shows, just given every day that the secondary business is transparent and alive online, is an opportunity for the manager and the promoter and the agent to figure out how to capture more of it. So I would say all \u2013 the thematic overall in every conversation we have about a tour or a show with the manager and an agent is how do we make sure we capture more of the marketplace. So, I would say that, we've said it over the last couple of years to slower process because of the fragmented business of a lot of managers and a lot of agents and lot of artists, but overall, thematically every artist, most manager and agent show represents a huge upside potential if they price the house to demand. And we think we have year-after-year, it will grow bit by bit as we increase the Platinum whether its VIP; however, the tool is, but we think most of our shows still have a huge opportunity on the revenue side. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. And on the Sponsorship and Advertising side, granted you called out the British pounds currency impacts, but are there any regions where the sponsors are stepping up some activity or maybe pulling back that we should be thinking of \u2013 and...? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, this is Joe. Not at all. I mean, we call it out in particular Sponsorship side, that's the piece that was really hit by the pound when you look at the different divisions and that's just the \u2013 where we have a lot of festivals, so where we have a lot of growth in our Sponsorship business. And that's really all there is to it. Then we're not seeing anything else geographically that would cause us any issues. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And then just a final housekeeping question for, Kathy. You mentioned after your refinancing the $250 million of extra cash on hand, is that incremental to the $179 million of free cash at the end of the quarter? Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes, it is because that $179 million is as of September and we completed the refinancing at the end of October. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll now move on to our next question from Kyle Evans with Stephens. Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Hi, thanks. You've made good progress growing your business with the 50-plus brands who spend over $1 million a year with you and you got 95% visibility on that for the year, what is the average length of those contracts and what kind of visibility do you have going into next year? And I've got a follow-up. Thanks. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So, if I split Sponsorship from Advertising, Sponsorship is about two-thirds of our business. The majority of those contracts are multi-year, anywhere from two to four years probably on average. And on the online Advertising side it tends to be shorter lead frame, generally within the year. So, across all that you'd expect to enter \u2013 by the time you're somewhere in the Q1, you have north of 50% of your revenue booked for the year. Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And my follow-up is if you have started telling the fraud free integrated primary, secondary ticketing story to consumers, I have missed it. It sounds very compelling. When do you expect to push that out and get after StubHub? Thanks. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Was it fraud-free? I missed the... Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Well, I guess what I'm saying is you have a unique, because you're on the barcode, you have a better chance that nothing is fraud-free, right? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Right. Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: But you have a pretty compelling value proposition to make relative to StubHub on the integrated, and because you can do a better job on the fraud front. I don't feel like you have told that story to consumers yet. First off, am I right? Second off, when will you do that? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. What I would say is we have not said it in \u2013 using TV commercials, broad media approach. I think if you look on sites or you look in some of the e-mail communication we do, absolutely it's been communicated. Clearly, we work with all of our clients and figure out for their fan base is, particularly on the season side what's the right way to communicate with the season ticket holders around where and how they should be selling their tickets. And I think that's going to be more of an organic ramp-up in terms of how we do that. We're not planning on doing it using TV commercials. Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Rich Tullo with Albert Fried. Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Hey, congratulations on a great quarter and thank you for taking my question. As I look at concert numbers, international was down a bit by roughly \u2013 are you with me? Hello? Unknown Speaker : Yeah, yeah. Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Okay. International's down a bit by something like 200 events year-on-year, but attendance is up nicely. So can you explain what's going on there? And are you rationalizing international and positioning for better growth? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, no rationalizing. We're growing the business, whether we have some \u2013 200 shows would have most likely be at the lower end club theater style that aren't overly relevant to the revenue, but as far as our core arena business, stadium business over there and bigger theaters continue a aggressive growth mandate as what we've been doing there. And we had a very good year in 2016 growing overall attendance and at our key festivals. Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks for that. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hey, Rich, this is Joe. Just again, to repeat the facts as I gave it is, year-to-date through three quarters international fan attendance is up 20% year-on-year, and we've had growth in all building types in terms of fan attendance. Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Okay. On the ancillaries, how much of that $2 incremental is due to VIP versus merchant services at the lower tier? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: It would be mostly \u2013 most of our business is food and beverage, is where we're going to grow most of our business. And quite honestly, most of it is wet because experientially at a concert one likes to have a beer and other. So, our business and where we focus mostly on is our food and beverage, is where the $2 is mostly coming from and where we think we still have a huge opportunity ahead of us. Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we'll now take our final question from Brandon Ross with BTIG Financial Services. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. A couple of questions on ticketing. First, a few weeks back, the SportsBusiness Journal reported that the NFL owners had agreed not to extend their primary ticketing deals past 2017 as they look at new ticketing models for their teams. I think the NFL Ticket Exchange deal is also up at the end of 2017. Are you guys involved in the creation of this new ticketing model? And if not, are you worried the NFL could create their own ticketing company like Major League Baseball did? And then on secondary ticketing, it seems that you meaningfully decelerated in secondary growth in the quarter. I know you said that we'll see a reacceleration in the next quarter, but was there a reason for the deceleration? With more domestic concerts in the quarter, we thought there might be a further acceleration due to primary, secondary integration. And then I have one on the media business after. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So Brandon, on the NFL, we're very aligned to their process. It's very typical that the leagues, when they're making these decisions, kind of try to rally all of the owners and have a step back, so we're involved. We ticket most of the football stadiums as well as we head a corporate NFL deal on secondary, and we're involved in the process and we will evaluate at the end as we look forward \u2013 as the process gets underway, what's best for us and them. But right now we continue to have great conversations and we fill a lot of their stadiums. So I think we'll look at that and we'll know further sometime next year. On the secondary... Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, yeah, on the secondary, so again just to be clear, Brandon, I didn't just say we'll generally improve in Q4. What I said is, October had an acceleration from Q3. So it's not to come, it actually is what's happened over the past month. Part of what exists for us is if you remember our deals, as you just said with the NFL, with the NBA, and then we tend to have high performance really driven at the concert on sale in the first week of the on sales drives a lot of that integrated secondary activity. And you'll see the 2017 concert on sales much more in Q4 than Q3, so we just have a natural period of much greater activity which will leverage all the fans coming to the Ticketmaster site in Q4 than we had in Q3. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Great. And then just on the media business, especially video. To date you've made smaller investments seemingly to extend your Sponsorship & Advertising business and have mostly used third-party platforms. Do you think there is an opportunity to build a larger media business for you guys with new revenue streams, and do you foresee a continuation of a distributed video strategy or could we see more in the own platform in the future, such as the Live Nation app? Thanks. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Brandon, as we've discussed, we think as most people are going through our \u2013 that content isn't core to their DNA, publishing to the eyeballs right now is kind of the risk-free version, so we like taking our festivals and our content and publishing them on and selling them through the published arms, whether it's our Snapchat deal with our festivals or selling our Justin Timberlake concert movie to Netflix or the show we sold to HBO on one of our concerts or Facebook Live. So, we think our core business is to take our 26,000 shows, create a great opportunity for advertisers to access 70 million fans onsite, and anyway we can amplify those shows and add more ad units to our portfolio, we think the best model right now is to put those festivals on a Snapchat medium and drive advertising and incremental advertising that way. We always double up and we air our content on LM.com in our app, but like most people are looking to our core is our concerts and the publishing path for us is the way that we can get much better eyeballs and more drive add units right now for our current ad users. If there was a great platform with scale, great, but I don't think you'll see use our balance sheet to try to create an access TV or a concert TV or spend a fortune trying to be destination driven. I think our job is, we're going to make most of our money on 26,000 shows and 70 million people showing up, selling advertisers who want to be part of the onsite and then amplifying onsite through the great publishing strategy where we can also monetize it without having to build the pipe. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, everyone, and this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment third quarter 2016 earnings call. You may now disconnect. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank you.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. Live Nation delivered a sixth consecutive year of record results across revenue, AOI and free cash flow, with revenue up 17%, operating income 47% and AOI 12% at constant currency. Our three core divisions, concerts, ticketing and advertising, each delivered their strongest AOI results in the history of the company. We continue to see tremendous power of the live event, with strong consumer demand and robust supply of new and established artists, hitting the road from clubs to stadiums. Live is truly a unique entertainment form that cannot be duplicated and creates lifetime memories that fans today are craving more than ever in this experienced economy. We believe the live business will continue to have strong growth for years to come as fans drive demand, artists are motivated to tour, and technology drives conversion. On the concert business, Live Nation continued to grow its global concert market share, adding 7 million fans in 2016 for a total of over 71 million fans, driving revenue up 20% and more than doubling concerts AOI. We built our global leadership position in every part of our business with double-digit fan growth in both North America and international, and across all channels of stadiums, amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs. We continued expanding our global footprint in 2016, as we added promoting offices in Germany, South Africa and Israel, taking us to over 40 countries worldwide. Across all markets, we invested $4.4 billion to stage 26,000 shows, ranking Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists in the music business. Average ticket prices for our show increased by 5% in 2016. These increases were driven largely by higher pricing for the best tickets, as artists moved to more effectively capture the true value from their shows versus leaving billions outside the event P&L. Onsite, our average spend grows well. Amphitheaters spending grew by 9% to over $22, as we added more high-end products, improved the quality of our offering and increased our point-of-sale. Our growth is continuing into 2017, a further sign of a tremendous fan demand for concerts and the success of our global platform. Ticket sales are up double-digit year-on-year through February 2017, driven by sales for arena and stadium shows. And we are confident we will again see strong demand across the business this year. Our advertising unit continued with its strong consistent growth profile with revenue up 15% and AOI 10% in 2016. 71 million fans onsite provides a unique advertising platform for our sponsors to touch fans directly at scale. And as brand spend more on events, Live Nation is poised to capture these dollars, given the direct fan touch, its scale, data insights and digital footprint. We saw this movement in 2016, with our top strategic sponsors, were a key driver for our growth. We now have over 50 plus brands who spend over $1 million per year with us, a collective spend of $245 million, up 20% from last year. Sponsorship in our festival portfolio continued to be very attractive for brands with sponsorship growth of 18% across our festival portfolio. And at the same time, we continue to amplify our onsite events with online mobile reach. In 2016, we generated over 4 billion views across Live Nation sites and platform partners including Snapchat, Facebook and YouTube, providing our brand partners with further scale and reach. We expect continue advertising AOI growth at historic levels in 2017, with 70% of our budgeted advertising revenue for the year already contracted, and pacing double-digit ahead of last year at this time. In 2016, Ticketmaster continued growing its global leadership in ticketing with fee-bearing GTV up 16% and overall GTV up 11% to $28 billion at constant currency, while delivering 480 million tickets to fans in 28 countries. Our secondary business continues to have robust growth with GTV up 26% in 2016. Overall, the Ticketmaster platform continues to demonstrate its effectiveness at selling tickets to fans, with 6 of the top 10 sales months ever recurring in 2016 and conversion rates up across both online and mobile platforms. Our recent investment in Ticketmaster's enterprise platform, an open API, now allow clients to sell tickets on partner sites, driving the sale of over 10 million tickets in 2016. This has further deepened our relationship with teams and artists who are looking for enhanced reach with sites such as Spotify, Bandsintown, Facebook, Groupon, Costco and more to come. With this combination of stronger than ever ticketing platform increased broad distribution, Ticketmaster is better positioned than ever to continue growing its global leadership position in ticketing. This success is continuing into 2017, as ticket sales are up 9% through February 17, positioning us for continued growth. Overall our success in 2016 reconfirms that Live Nation has created an unparalleled live platform, bringing 550 million fans in 40 countries that's unrivaled two hours of live events. The live business continues to have strong growth opportunity with artists touring as their primary source of income and fans showing up record levels across the globe for that lifetime experience. All of this creates tremendous runway for Live Nation to continue delivery, the level of growth we have demonstrated over the last several years. As I've already indicated, the key leading indicators for each of our businesses on a year-on-year basis into February are pointing to another strong year in 2017. With that I'll turn over to Joe, who will take you through additional details on the deliverables on each division. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first Concerts. For the full year, Live Nation Concerts revenue was up 20% and AOI was up 125% on constant currency. We grew our attendance by 12% to a record 71 million fans, once again promoting the vast majority of the top global tours including Beyonc\u00e9, Coldplay, and Guns N' Roses. For the year, looking at markets in North America, attendance grew by 12%, 48 million fans with show count up 4% and attendance per show up 7%. And stadiums and amphitheaters were each up by about 2 million fans. Internationally, attendance was up 13% driven by a 2 million fan increase in stadium attendance. Globally, we continued growing our festival portfolio, adding 11 festivals to give us a global portfolio of 85 festivals in 12 countries. As a result, we increased festival attendance by 15% to over 7 million fans, and now have 23 festivals that each attract over 100,000 fans. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, concert revenue was up 3% and AOI up 45%, both at constant currency. These results were driven by a favorable shift in show mix with more fans at higher priced arena and stadium shows, while overall attendance was flat year-over-year for the quarter. As we move into 2017, as Michael said, ticket sales are up with over 28 million tickets already sold for shows this year. And our confirmed show pipeline for amphitheaters, arenas, and stadiums is up 11%, with three artists, Coldplay, U2 and Bruno Mars already selling over 1 million tickets each for tours this year. At Artist Nation, revenue was down 2% at constant currency in 2016 and most importantly, our Artist Nation artists continue to be a key feeder to our concerts flywheel. And in 2016, these artists performed for over 7 million of our fans in almost 600 shows. Turning to sponsorship & advertising, it delivered 15% revenue and 10% AOI growth for the year at constant currency and in the fourth quarter at constant currency, revenue was up 22% and AOI was up 11%. Finally Ticketmaster, in 2016 ticketing revenue was up 13%, while AOI was up 6%, as we grew global GTV on fee-bearing tickets by 16%, all at constant currency. Primary ticket fee-bearing GTV was up 15% at constant currency for the year, with concerts leading this growth with over a $1 billion increase in GTV. Secondary ticketing GTV was up 26% for the full year at constant currency, with concerts and the major sports leagues similarly contributing to this growth. Mobile ticketing continued growing rapidly, up 36% to over 45 million tickets sold in 2016 as we continued improving our mobile website and apps. Ticketing margin declined 1.1% year-on-year as we continued growing our global platform, both geographically and with new products. We entered four new countries in 2016 as we continued focusing on expanding our international business, substantially in markets that have a lower service fee structure and therefore lower margin profile than the traditional U.S. business. Similarly, we delivered very strong growth in both our Front Gate festival platform and our Universe do-it-yourself business in 2016, with ticket sales up almost 30% and more than doubling respectively. Continued expansion into these markets and product lines is core to our global ticketing strategy, one which has been successful in growing our customer base, ticketing volume and profitability over the past several years, and which we expect to continue being successful going forward. For the fourth quarter, global fee-bearing GTV was up 15%, revenue was up 11% and AOI down 4% at constant currency. And secondary GTV grew by 13%, while primary GTV was up 15%, both at constant currency. In summary, in 2016 each of our core businesses grew revenue and AOI. Looking forward in 2017, we expect to continue our growth based on our leading indicators. In concerts, show count and ticket sales for shows this year are both up double-digits. Sponsorship & advertising has sold over 70% of their budgeted activity for the year, pacing double-digits ahead of last year. And ticketing sales volume is up 9% through mid-February. Together, this gives us confidence that we will continue growing our business at historical rates. A few points of note, first from a phasing standpoint with our planned strong summer concert season, particularly with festivals and stadiums, we expect our AOI to be even more Q3 driven this year. As a result, we expect Q1 as a percentage of full year AOI to be lower than last year. And on FX, we ended 2016 with a 2% impact on revenue and a 1% impact on AOI. At this point, we don't see a material impact on 2017 numbers. I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with our results for the fourth quarter. Revenue increased by 4% to $1.8 billion, and AOI was $83 million. Revenue improved 5% to $1.83 billion on a constant currency basis. Ticketing contributed to more than half of the overall revenue growth, up 11% at constant currency, driven by increased volume in both our primary and resale businesses. Fourth quarter concert revenue was also up 3% at constant currency, driven by higher ticket prices from show mix. Strong profit growth in our concert segment, along with higher advertising results, largely drove our AOI performance in the fourth quarter. Operating loss was $37 million in the fourth quarter, an improvement of 8% compared to last year. Net loss for the quarter was $101 million, compared to a loss of $78 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Results were negatively impacted by $14 million in expenses associated with refinancing our debt in October, additional interest expense of $5 million, primarily due to the timing of the 7% note redemption, and $4 million due to the timing of income attributable to non-controlling interest. And now for the full year results. Revenue was $8.4 billion, an increase of 15%, and AOI was up 11% to $640 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue improved by 17% to $8.5 billion and AOI was $646 million, an increase of 12%. Free cash flow was $352 million as compared to $335 million in 2015. All of our core segments, concerts, sponsorship & advertising, and ticketing delivered strong revenue growth for the year. The majority of our overall revenue increase was driven by the concert segment, which was up 20% in constant currency, primarily from higher global stadium activity, as well as arena and amphitheater events in North America. Concerts revenue also benefited from higher ancillary onsite revenue at our North America amphitheaters this year. Ticketing revenue increased 13% at constant currency, with higher global primary and resale volume. And sponsorship & advertising revenue was up 15% at constant currency from new or expanded sponsorship programs, higher online advertising and increased festival activity in North America. The 12% growth in our overall AOI for the full year at constant currency was driven by all our core segments delivering growth in AOI during the year. Concerts AOI more than doubled as a result of higher event activity along with an increase in onsite ancillary spend. Our advertising business continued to deliver strong AOI growth of 10% at constant currency from higher sales. As we mentioned last quarter, we recorded a bad debt reserve of $6 million related to a client going out of business in Q3. This impacted our full year AOI growth in this segment by almost 3%. And our ticketing segments' AOI was up 6% at constant currency, driven by the higher primary and resale volume during the year. Operating income was $195 million, an increase of 48% over last year, driven by the increase in AOI. Net income for the year was $3 million, compared to a loss of $33 million in 2015. For the full year, we recorded $50 million related to the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interests from certain acquisition-related put/call arrangements that impacts the calculation of earnings per share. We expect accretion of $60 million in total for 2017 based on our current holdings. And finally, amortization of non-receivable ticketing contract advances for 2016 was $86 million compared to $88 million in 2015, including purchase accounting impact. Beginning in 2017, we will move from four to three reportable business segments : concerts, sponsorship & advertising, and ticketing. We believe combining our concerts and Artist Nation segments will more accurately reflect the activities of our concerts business by including the full range of services we provide to artists. Moving to our balance sheet, as of December 31, we had total cash of $1.5 billion, including $591 million in ticketing client cash and $525 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $411 million. Cash flow provided by operations was $597 million in 2016, compared to $308 million in 2015. This growth came from higher net income and an improvement in net working capital, driven by increased cash received for future events along with timing of payables. Free cash flow for the year was $352 million, up 5% over last year, driven by the growth in our AOI. Free cash flow as a percentage of AOI was 55%. This percentage was impacted by higher distributions to non-controlling interests and non-consolidated affiliates in 2016. $26 million of this increase was driven by investing in new or increased equity interest along with a multi-year distribution that was paid in 2016. Without this impact, our free cash flow as a percentage of AOI would have been 59% and we expect our free cash flow percentage to return to historical levels for 2017. For the full year, total capital expenditures were $187 million, essentially split between maintenance and revenue generating items. The increase this year was primarily due to technology system enhancements and venue related projects. For 2017, we expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $220 million, with about half of this towards revenue generating expenditures. Following our debt refinancing in October, our total net debt as of December 2016 was $2.3 billion with a weighted average cost of 3.8%, down from 4.3% at the end of the third quarter. As we look forward to 2017, our total deferred revenues for future shows, our key leading indicator, was $722 million at the end of 2016, up 30% over the $553 million last year, another factor pointing to the strength of our 2017 concert pipeline. Thank you for joining us today and we will now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : First, we'll take John Janedis from Jefferies. Your line is open. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Michael, there has been a lot of focus on ticketing with the potential for new entrants from Amazon to much smaller players. So as you look out for this year and beyond, do you anticipate much of a change in the competitive landscape or the profitability or fee structure of the industry more broadly? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, we don't see that the core profitability of the business changing. Service fees are a pretty vital part of the client business. So the service fees are driven by the client, and majority of that go to the sports team or the venue or the artist, ultimately. So we don't see the economics change. It's \u2013 tickets always been a competitive industry. I think the \u2013 some of the pivotal moves that we made over the last few years on our platform, predicting that eventually we would have to become more flexible for our clients and build a better platform that was more open than closed, TM+ when we put secondary on our platform with the start of opening up a historically closed platform. And then the APIs that we've talked about over the last year, of really looking to figure out how to power that buy button and allocate tickets to other platforms that can increase conversion such as the Groupon's and the Facebook's, Spotify's and we're having conversations with Amazon and we'll look to allocate our API that way too if there is some incremental ticket sales that can occur. So, we think the \u2013 the core value of Ticketmaster at the core is incredible system software that helps clients sell tickets. We have an incredible great marketplace, one of the largest websites in the world that's growing stronger every year and we think we're also going to make sure that our clients and artists and fans through our new platform have the opportunity to enhance in their reach also through these platforms. So, we think that, the fact we've embraced over the last couple of years, this idea that having multiple points of sale is good for our business, that increases sales, and ultimately in Live Nation core business, our 70 million plus fans, lots of shows are unsold, lots of fans don't know about shows still. So, we're all supportive of having a wider distribution platform selling concert tickets to increase ultimately the sale. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : All right. Thanks, Michael. And maybe separately, you know appreciating the comments on the segment at least historically. Can you talk more about Artist Nation, obviously costs have ticked up over the past couple of years along with margin pressure and I was hoping you could speak to that, maybe the underlying health of that business and any secular headwinds that maybe emerging? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. We've been very consistent on that segment. It's \u2013 we don't consider it a core segment in itself, we've always considered it a very important, strategic piece of the business to power our core business. So this year, we had some investments in certain of the management companies that brought down some of the margin. But overall, we like that business, it's a very high margin business, it's a very accretive business when we bring in partners. And more importantly, it's great to be close to the talent, if you can feed your core businesses to drive your overall segment. So we like the business. We're going to keep \u2013 we think being closer with artist managers and having over up to 300 artists in your portfolio, while decisions on what promoter and what sponsors to play with and what ticketing companies can help you are smart, strategic businesses to be in. And we think 2017 will actually be a stronger year for that division as it's got a robust touring schedule ahead for them. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : And next, we'll go to Amy Yong with Macquarie. Your line is open. Ms. Yong, your line is open. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi, can you hear me? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Now I can. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hello? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Amy, we can hear... Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Sorry about that. So, first question is for Kathy, on the $220 million CapEx guidance, can you talk about where the revenue generating CapEx is being allocated to? And perhaps, where the growth is actually going to come from and where we should see that on the top line? And then as you start generating cash, can you just talk about priorities of cash, given some of the M&A activity that you've seen? Thank you. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. So basically the $220 million will be spent on ticketing, as it has in the past, generally. And then in concerts, we have some opportunities with venues for expansion of the overall footprint, there we're going to be putting the money into. So those are the main drivers for the change. And, sorry, and then continuing on the onsite part, continued VIP as well as food and beverage changes as we've been doing in 2016. As far as where we're... Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sorry? Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: No, I'm sorry. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And then as far as where we're putting the money, there's no change in what we've been saying. So we're continuing to invest in the business and that's revenue generating CapEx, that's acquisitions, that's advances to artists and clients. So I don't see any change in that direction in 2017. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. And just on the onsite revenue which grew 9%, and I think a lot of people think there is a long runway for growth here and it's pretty achievable. Where do you think that that can go? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, Amy, this is Joe. I think we've said on a few occasions that we benchmark ourselves against sports teams in that regard. We're at about $22 for our amphitheaters right now. We think that over time that could be a $30 kind of number for our fans at the amphitheaters. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Your line is open. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Just on concerts. I think this was the best Q4 in terms of AOI, at least since the merger with Ticketmaster. Was this entirely driven by mix or were there other factors at play here such as higher ancillary spending? Just trying to get a sense for the strong performance. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I think, number one as we called out was the mix and just the volume of some of the bigger shows. Michael also talked about the higher ticket pricing that flowed through, particularly on the front of the house, which helps a lot in the concert business. And then, yes, onsite, all of the BIF (27:33) that flowed through for festivals or amphitheaters into the early part of the fourth quarter. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just with Lollapalooza expanding to another location in Paris this year, how much of an ongoing opportunity do you see to take some of your festival brands and bring them abroad? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, we think Lolla's just got a real exceptional profile. It's one of the few brands that has been able to expand to South America, now into Europe successfully. So, we see that brand as very global with \u2013 we got a runway of growth planned for that brand around the world. And our Electric Daisy brand in Vegas, the largest dance festival in the world, now in Mexico this week \u2013 next week, we will sell 200,000 tickets to that EDC Mexico edition that we started a couple of years ago. So we see that EDC now in Europe and in Brazil and Mexico and Japan. So, we think, out of our 80 plus brands, we have a very central strategy around what brands can move or what best practices can move. So we think there's a few others that have some potential. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And next, we'll take Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is open. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. I always get a smidgen nervous when things get reclassified or combined. But I recognize Artist Nation is pretty small. Is there any reason to believe that the revenues or adjusted operating income at Artist Nation will change from sort of the historic levels once we mash this together with concerts? Thanks. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: It is purely, I mean if you've listened to us earnings after earnings, we have three core businesses, and the management business is obviously paramountly strategic to our concert business, that's why we're in it. And it's where all of the material value is driven. So, we want to make sure that we just align that kind of activity around the outcome. We wake up every day talking to artist managers about what our market share is in the concert business, not whether they made $3 million or $4 million that year. So our core goal of all of that is to provide a great value to those artists and win over their touring business and drive it. So you don't get \u2013 when you separate it slightly and you get questions like the other one on what's the growth profile? To look at the growth profile, you have to say how many shows did you promote last year and what was that success rate. So we want to just align those activities against what the core mission is, just to drive our global touring business, and we use that as an investment strategy to do that. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : And next, we'll take John Tinker with Gabelli. Your line is open. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thank you. A more general question. Well, two questions. One is, your largest shareholder's now actually Formula 1, and could you perhaps discuss where you think you fit into that? And secondly, what might the opportunities be given that Chase has said he really wants to turn each one of the races into a Super Bowl, and you can certainly look at the fact that Taylor Swift saved the event in Austin, and would that be material or is it just a small add-on? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I mean where Maffei and Malone decide to park their investment in us or what they call it, they're much smarter at that than I am. They've been incredible shareholders, they're long-term players as you know. So, we're aligned to the same principles. We want to grow long-term shareholder value and they've been great shareholders. So, I don't spend much time worrying about where they're housing their investment, it doesn't affect our day-to-day business. Greg is our Chairman, we talk strategy, not what ticker it will be under. As far as Formula 1, I've met Chase, big fan of his, his history, obviously, I don't know a lot about Formula 1. From what I've seen under the covers, it certainly looks like it's got a real untapped potential, little bit unique \u2013 a little bit relevant to our business in the sense that it's a global business with different local promoters, but they'll have to figure out how to centralize some strategies to extract some value. We don't think it's an overriding huge opportunity to the bottom-line, but we're absolutely talking of them as we would be talking always to the NFL. We've done it with the Indianapolis 500 in the past, NASCAR. If you got a race track, a lot of people and a check book, we're willing to figure out how to enhance your event through entertainment. And, I think, they're very motivated to reinvent the experience, and we'll \u2013 we're going to see if we can help them on a few of those. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Just one more quick question. What's your NOL now and at what point would you anticipate beginning to pay more tax? Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hold on while I pull up the total, not really much change and we still have several years, John, before we think that we'll be a U.S. taxpayer. As you know, we pay state and we pay some Federal, but we're several years out from hitting that. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll take David Joyce with Evercore ISI. David Joyce - Evercore ISI : Thank you. I wanted to touch on the ticketing margins. Again, Joe you had mentioned how you entered four more countries in the past year, and that impacted the margins a little bit. You also more recently entered Israel and Eastern Europe. Could you help us think about the margins for 2017 in terms of how far along you are in integrating the acquisitions from last year as well as the new additions to the footprint? Thank you. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, the acquisitions are integrated. I don't think that's the issue. The issue is, as when you enter a new market, you're going to be at a lower scale and most of these markets are also lower service fee as a percentage of your ticket price often times and some of them you're also a lower ticket price. So, your margin profile is just going to be structurally lower in those markets. So, as we've talked, our overriding focus at Ticketmaster is to continue to drive the global sales of that business. On our platform, as Michael talked through the open APIs, off of our platform, we've served the teams and the artists by selling their tickets more effectively and selling more of them. That means more countries, it means more other platforms like the Front Gate and do-it-yourself platform that I talked about. And in a lot of those cases, those tickets that we sell, the incremental ticket maybe at a lower margin then some of the other tickets, but it continues to build the business, serve our customers and drive the overall cash profitability of the business. So that playbook has worked pretty well for the past five years, and we expect to continue doing that over the next few years. I don't think we're at a point that we're going to declare what the margins are for 2017 in that business right now, but you can expect us to overall continue to do everything we can to grow the business. David Joyce - Evercore ISI : All right. Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll take John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Joe, I want to ask a little bit about the Ticketmaster business. On secondary (35:36) I think you said gross ticket value grew 26%. Is there a way that you can help us think about maybe which units of ticket are growing on that platform? And as you study that business and how it's evolving, how you feel your share kind of shook out within the industry in 2016 and maybe how you're thinking compared to a year ago? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. So, again, I think stepping back, John, the first thing that we always look at when we talk about the secondary business is that it's $8 billion value that is sitting outside the P&L of the artists and the teams that are driving the content. And so, we then have a two-part strategy. One is, how do we through the concert side and through the ticketing side work with the artists in particular to remove as much of that price arbitrage as we can. And how do we work with the team to make sure they've got both the data as well as the marketing capability to remove their arbitrage. And we will always be most successful, the more that we can drive that arbitrage back into the primary side of the house. And again, Michael talked earlier about the price increases that we were seeing as artists are becoming \u2013 this is becoming very transparent and artists are seeing it and understanding it and therefore, they are going after that money. So item number one is, we're attacking it that way. Item number two has been, yes, as long as there is price inefficiency, we are going to be focused on building the best secondary offer out there for fans to transparently easily get their tickets, have them verified and have a great experience with it. So we had a lot of success in growth of our market share and of our overall business in 2016, I expect that continued in 2017. But we also don't \u2013 we just don't obsess over which column is it in. Frankly, we'd rather have more in column A than column B. But that's going to depend as we work with every artist and every team on what agenda they want. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Fair enough. I'd want to ask just about capital allocation going forward. If I think about the evolution of the company you guys have grown AOI at record levels for a number of years, and the free cash flow has been great and you guys have kind of grown it to the leverage of the business. As I think about that, is there any kind of changing thought process in terms of how you think about allocating capital? Does returning capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks start to become more of a priority for the company than it has been historically? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. And we absolutely believe that every opportunity that we've seen over the last five years exists more today than at any other point. As we go into more markets, that gives us the scale and infrastructure to continue going into more markets. As we build our management teams, our technology platforms, very focused on delivering the fans and our clients on a global basis, we just think we're better at it and we're better able to go into markets than either build or acquire additional assets, keep doing exactly what we've been doing. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : Next, we have Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. One of the numbers that really jumped out all year long was the average attendance per event. I think it was up globally about 9% for the year. How much of that was just the mix this year, because you had a lot of big stadium tours and how much of it was sort of this long-term strategy of trying to better sell out the house? Then I've got a follow-up. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Doug, it was obviously both, and we haven't given the exact breakdown, but we're benefited by the large increase in stadiums that I called out, 2 million increase in each North America and international. But even when you back that out, absolutely in 2016 across the board, we did continue to see that we were growing attendance per show at our amphitheaters, at our arenas, stadiums as we were continually better at marketing and pricing the product, distributing the ticket sale to hit every fan everywhere that we could, and that continues to be a priority in 2017. Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then a follow-up. You talked a lot about the momentum in sponsorship. Where are you at from a progress point of view, in terms of monetizing your digital audience, in terms of digital advertising? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think monetizing our digital audience the way we think about it, Michael alluded to a bit is, our truly unique positioning starts with our 70 million fans. These other people have online assets as well. And so, what we're really seeing with the online business is that when you're talking to a sponsor about a large strategic platform for their brand and their brand strategy for reaching out, touching a target customer, that the online is an enhancement and augmentation that gives us an additional set of ad units, gives us additional reach against the core of our onsite interaction, activation that we can deliver. Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And next we have Kyle Evans from Stephens. Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. You talked a little bit about the dynamics in the secondary market and how much money is outside the artists P&L. We saw the expected slowdown at StubHub, as they annualized some of their process changes. Could you give us an updated view on the competitive landscapes specifically as it relates to StubHub? And then I have some follow-ups. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I mean I think as we've said all along that our view is we're focused on the business as StubHub has gotten refocused and on the business as well and as a few others, Vivid here, Viagogo internationally, that we all have the capability to invest a lot of dollars on brand, on customer acquisition. You probably see some concentration amongst some of the larger players that are now fighting out for the volume and the share. Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And you... Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And also just to add to that, we always kind of get a little U.S. centric here, but we've been very effective on a global basis of moving faster than the historic Ticketmaster that we inherited did here. So in the UK, Australia, all across Europe where we have launched a secondary platform, we are number one, close to number one. I mean StubHub really is only strong in America. They are obviously expanding, but we wanted \u2013 global basis, we're seeing great success as we're either a leader or an early entrant into a lot of the markets. So we see on a global basis, we'll continue to have market share growth on that segment. Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Great. I know it's early, but you've given us this February 17 show pipeline number in the supplemental. If attendance stays strong and you've got \u2013 you are at 11% on show growth in amphitheaters, arenas, and stadiums. Aside from an economic slowdown, are there any other scenarios where you would expect that metric to tick down over the course of the year into the single-digits? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hey, I think we are seeing artists confirming and putting on their shows earlier and earlier, which is great, because it gives us more clarity on the volume of activity we're going to have. I think if you looked over time, that number probably ticks down modestly and we weren't giving it to give a specific, this is exactly how much many more shows we're going to give. We gave it to indicate we believe the business will continue to grow in 2017. Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. We're deep into the call, maybe this is a little nitpicky, but your overseas cash jumped up by a couple hundred million to $712 million and in the case, as you don't plan to repatriate, how should we be thinking about that cash number? Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: A lot of that is part of the deferred revenue at year end, so they've sold tickets for future shows as well, so the reason why we say we don't repatriate, it will be used for their events and pay artists, et cetera. Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. How much of that's not deferred? Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I'm sorry? Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: You said a lot of that is from deferred? Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. It's going to be primarily deferred, sponsorship, all kinds of things. We don't have more granularity to give you on that, but generally, our cash is going to tick up with the deferred revenue. Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll take Ben Mogil from Stifel. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. So good afternoon. Thanks for letting me on. So just wanted to go back, I guess to Kyle's question around the secondary market. Are the numbers that I think you were talking about around $8 billion market size, and I think you talked about it in 2015 being like in the $5 billion or the $6 billion range. Are these estimates still relatively loose, just given that there is a large part of the market which is kind of non-institutional if you will? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And are you finding that in general the two of you, you and StubHub collectively, are kind of gaining share not only as the market grows, but gaining share from independents or are the independents in collective sort of holding their own as well? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I would say we \u2013 I think StubHub has always had market leadership in the U.S. I think we've obviously grown strong and taken market share from the independents in the U.S. Outside of America, Viagogo and others have been out there and we would be the one taking market share from most of the independents in different countries. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And I apologize, because I got on the call late. I'm not sure if you talked much about \u2013 from the European, I know it's very early in terms of festival dates in Europe and particularly in the UK. Are you seeing any kind of weakness just given some of the economic sort of turmoil over there, if you will? Turmoil's my word, just the economic comments? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, no, we haven't seen \u2013 we had a strong 2016 in Europe obviously and international, and we're off in February to a strong on-sale right now across Europe. We don't see any slowdown in any countries right now. We see a very robust planned and on-sale so far. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's great. Thanks, Michael. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Ben. Operator : And next, we'll take Brandon Ross with BTIG. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I actually just want to follow up on some of the earlier questions from the call. The first question is a follow-up on John Janedis' question. Michael, to be clear, do you view Amazon as a competitor or as a partner? And do you think the U.S. exclusivity model could be in jeopardy with Amazon and StubHub looking to be primary retailers? Then a follow-up on Amy's question on the CapEx. On ticketing CapEx, can you just help us decipher how you divide between revenue generating and maintenance CapEx there? It could be very kind of hard to unpack that. If you re-platform or move infrastructure to the cloud, do you consider that revenue generating or do you consider that maintenance? And then a follow-up on David's question, about margins. You mentioned international growth and the mix kind of there. But on the Q2 call, when we asked about down margins, you guys kind of reiterated that margins would end up flat for the year, despite the mix pressures in the middle of the year. What happened there that you did not anticipate in prior guidance that you gave? Thanks. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: That's all, Brandon? Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Well, I actually have one more, but I'll save it. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. We've been talking the last couple of years about an API open allocated market. We've been very clear that the rest of the world has always been allocation, and Ticketmaster does very well in those markets. We got a strong market leadership, generally at a lower cost per ticket. We've seen over the years that eventually \u2013 we always had kind of stated that we thought that more distribution points were going to be a reality in the business for clients. Why we were very aggressive over the last few years in building an API to help clients and artists, et cetera, have opportunity, like StubHub \u2013 Spotify and Bandsintown, and Groupon, and others. So, yeah, we believe that the smartest strategy for Ticketmaster as a software platform has always been to solve the client's needs, to create \u2013 to provide great platform software, provide a great marketplace and provide the flexibility to use partner sites to help augmented sales. Because as you know when you have as many customers as we do, you're the hottest team in the NBA, you're not that worried about partner sites. You're not really worried about Amazon if you're U2, which sold 1 million tickets in an hour. But if you are a team or an artist that like most of the business needs to sell a few extra tickets, you're always going to be looking for incremental distribution points. So we've always believed that being open API driven, letting our clients have opportunity to power other retail sites is a smart strategy for Ticketmaster, and we've been doing that over the last couple of years now, finding partner sites to augment sales. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : So you see Amazon as a partner then? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. We see them as a retail partner, absolutely. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Okay. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: On the CapEx question, think about it from new tools or new clients versus other things. So if we are adding technology to our mobile product or adding functionality to TM+, those things would be revenue generating. If we get a new client where we have to add hardware or make some changes, that's going to be revenue generating. Other things like your question on CapEx related to cloud, moving to the cloud or just replacing hardware, et cetera, would generally be maintenance. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Right. So, if you work on your mobile app, that would be considered revenue generating CapEx, you said? Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. For adding new technology and new tools to it, absolutely. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So we sold 45 million tickets on mobile this year versus zero a few years back. So that obviously helps generate additional revenue. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Right. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: On the TM margin, you're right, six months ago we had a slightly different forecast for what the margin was going to be, and as you could imagine, a lot of things happened over the \u2013 a hundred (51:06) things happened over the six months as we unpacked it. It's really \u2013 a lot of it is what I called out. One is we had tremendous performance by our Front Gate ticketing business. That little festival focused ticketing business up 30% in terms of the volume of tickets that it sold. It's a fantastic product. It's been very successful with a lot of festivals, and if it has a little lower margin, okay. The same with the do-it-yourself at Universe more than doubling in terms of their ticket volume. So in some cases, you're a victim of your own success, driving the overall profitability of the business at the impact of some of the margin. But there is nothing dramatic, different. It was just all the pieces and how they came together. And as we said, we're happy as long as we're continuing to grow the cash profitability of the business. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Okay. And just one more on secondary. I think it was up 13% in Q3, then again 13% in Q4, even though it had reaccelerated I think early in Q4. What happened the rest of the quarter there? And do you foresee a reacceleration in secondary GTV in 2017 or do you think this is sort of a new normal that we should model off of? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I mean it's \u2013 as I talked through Brandon, we have two columns, the bringing it into the primary and building the secondary in. We're way too early to have a view on what's the mix of that that we think will be most successful in. We'd love to move that entire $8 million, shrink the secondary and bring it all into the primary, but a lot of that depends on our conversations with the artists and with the teams and exactly what they want to do and how they want to do it. So, we're not worried about again the forecast of that split as much as continuing to offer a great product on both and building the overall business. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Thank you for the questions. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. Operator : We have no further questions. That does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter's conference call. Live Nation has continued growing its business in 2017, with first quarter revenue up 17% and AOI up 25%, with strong operating performance across all our concert, advertising and ticketing segments. This year, we have booked more shows, sold more tickets and have more sponsorship commitments than ever before at this point of the year. With the strength of these leading indicators, I'm confident we will once again deliver record top line and AOI performance in each of our businesses in 2017. The global concert industry is structurally growing, with strong tailwinds for both supply and demand. On the supply side, artists are touring now more than ever as live as their primary source of income. And on the demand side, between the millennial shifting of spend to experiences and the globalization of artists on social media, we see continued long-term growth as fans attending more concerts. And as of May 1, we are seeing this trend in our results, as we have booked over 4,000 arenas, stadium and amphitheater shows for 2017, up 10% over last year. This growth has led to arena and stadium shows up 18% and 32% respectively. And as a result, tickets sold through April for our concerts this year are up 25% to 46 million tickets. Along with the strong show and ticket count increase, we expect to continue driving the profitability of our concert business through increased on-site spending. This year we have invested to add more points of sale and continuing to refine our product assortment and pricing to drive fan satisfaction and sales. As more of our venues and festivals become Wi-Fi connected, we are seeing increased per fan spend through services such as seat order delivery, and we continue to scale up this summer with this service. Looking globally at the concert business, we now promote shows in 40 countries, as we continued reaching more fans in more markets. Our promotion business in Germany has been particularly successful. Having launched Live Nation Germany just one year ago, we now expect Germany to be our Number 2 market in Europe in 2017, with 1.5 million fans attending our shows. With all parts of our global concert business looking strong this year, the concert segment continues to be the engine that powers the Live Nation flywheel strategy, growing the profitability of the concert business, while also driving our advertising and ticketing business. In our advertising and sponsorship division, we continue to see strong brand demand for our 70 million-plus on-site audience, driving double-digit growth in our advertising business. As of May 1, we have commitments for over 80% of our planned advertising inventory for the year, pacing double-digits ahead of last year. We expect double-digit growth in festival sponsorship this year. And with over 80 festivals, it remains a top channel for brands to engage with their customers. And on our top client brands that spend over $1 million in advertising, we continue to see their increased spend, which now accounts for 75% of our total spend, and we see pacing in double-digits through April. We're also seeing increased demand for concert video content. In addition to announcing Twitter as our latest partner in streaming live concerts, we have captured four concerts in VR in partnerships with Hulu and NextVR, and last week we premiered the Live Nation-produced Puff Daddy documentary, Can't Stop, Won't Stop; The Bad Boy Story at the Tribeca Film Festival, and now being distributed by Apple. Collectively, this content provides us with an array of additional ad units and provides valuable marketing for our tours. Taking this all together, I expect us to again deliver double-digit AOI growth in our advertising business. In our first quarter, Ticketmaster delivered its largest quarter in history for GTV and ticket volume on a transacted basis. Our growth in this quarter came from both fee-bearing primary and secondary business, with GTV up 18% and 20% respectively. Our success starts with continuing to build our venue client base. In the first quarter, we added 245 new clients, providing them with the most effective software platform for their ticketing needs. On the commerce side, we began by attracting more fans to our sites, and in this quarter, we increased online business by 10% year-over-year and grew app installed base by 41% to 33 million. And once these fans come to our site or app, our investments to-date to improve the experience and purchase flow are driving higher conversion rates and increased sales for us. Other major initiatives we launched this past quarter is a new product called Fan Verified (sic) [Verified Fan], which leverages proprietary data and analytics to screen and verify potential ticket buyers, so we increase the likelihood that real fans will purchase tickets to artists' shows. We've now supported over 30 tours including Depeche Mode, Twenty One Pilots and Harry Styles, as they seek new ways to help get the tickets in the hands of real fans. This program has been highly successful in reducing by over 90% the number of tickets that have been sold on the resale market. With this strong start to the year, we expect another record year in ticketing. And overall, we see 2017 on track to deliver another year of record growth. All of the leading indicators for our concert, sponsorship and advertising business are ahead of last year and we expect our business to deliver record results. With that, I will turn it over to Joe. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at the business segments, first concerts, revenue grew 16% in the first quarter at constant currency, while AOI was down. This revenue increase was driven by growth in fans attending our shows up 22% to 10.9 million, with higher arena and stadium show count both in North America and internationally. AOI was down in part due to our higher cost structure for our concerts business, as we've scaled up our promotions and on-site product teams. We expect to benefit from this investment and the increased activity that will play out in the second and third quarters. To that point, as Michael said, we've already booked over 4,000 amphitheater, arena and stadium shows this year, up 10% from this point last year. And once again, we're promoting the vast majority of the top global tours, led by six tours, each already selling over 1 million tickets so far this year, including Coldplay, U2, Bruno Mars, Depeche Mode, Guns N' Roses and Metallica. We're also continuing to build our global festival portfolio, and this year we expect to hold 96 festivals, increasing our attendance to over 8 million fans. Our international markets continue to have a very strong lineup, and we expect to have 9,000 shows with more than 25 million fans in 2017, continuing to demonstrate the power of promoting artists in 40 countries around the world. From a timing standpoint, part of our ticket sales to-date are driven by the typically earlier on-sale timing for arena and stadium shows. For the full-year, we expect to deliver mid-single digit growth in both show count and attendance. Q2 looks to be particularly strong for both show count and attendance this year, thanks to these arena and stadium shows and some timing of our major festivals. And overall, we're delighted thus far with 2017 continuing to grow our concerts flywheel this year. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business, revenue grew by 13% and AOI grew by 10% for the first quarter, both at constant currency. Over 85% of our advertising AOI is typically recognized in the second through fourth quarters, so it's our committed sales pipeline that is our key leading indicator for the business at this point, and as Michael noted, 80% of our business expected for the year is already contracted and we're tracking double-digit ahead of this time last year. Finally, Ticketmaster, for the quarter, revenue was up 23% and AOI was up 25%, both at constant currency. Fee-bearing GTV was up 18% to $3.7 billion globally at constant currency and our primary fee-bearing GTV was also up 18% at constant currency, as we increased ticket sales by 11% and pricing was up 6% on average. Both North America and international markets grew ticket volume similarly, with North America up 10% and international up 11%. Not surprisingly, given our comments on a strong quarter for concert sales, our concerts segment drove approximately 60% of the ticket volume growth and 70% of the primary GTV growth for the quarter. In secondary, we grew our GTV 20% for the quarter at constant currency, our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Here two concerts were the primary growth driver accounting for 70% of the increased GTV. Michael pointed to the continued success Ticketmaster is having in attracting more fans to our sites and converting these visits to sales. And one additional point I want to make is on the continued growth of our mobile platform, as we further improve our mobile online experience in apps and we're increasing our traffic, app installs and conversion. And as a result, mobile ticket sales increased 39% year-over-year for the quarter, and overall mobile sales now represents 30% of our global ticket sales. Looking at the full year for ticketing, we expect the first quarter will be our best in terms of year-on-year comparisons, given the volume of concerts we put on sale. Between this strong first quarter and continued success attracting and converting buyers in both primary and secondary ticketing, we expect to deliver a mid- to high-single digit AOI growth for the year. And in summary, four months into the year, given the strength of all our leading indicators, we're confident that we will deliver record results in 2017. Our flywheel business model is working. Our first quarter results were driven by our ticketing business, notably from selling more tickets to more concerts. And in Q2 and Q3, we will see these concerts play-out, driving our high-margin, on-site and advertising businesses. On to few specifics, looking at seasonality, we expect Q2 to be a strong concerts quarter as I noted, and so AOI at a bit higher percentage of our full-year AOI than last year. And on FX, we saw a 1% to 2% impact on the business in Q1. And based on rates today, expect Q2 to be about the same. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe and good afternoon everyone. As I mentioned last time, we are now reporting three business segments starting this quarter; concerts, sponsorship & advertising, and ticketing. We have combined our previously reported Artist Nation segment into concerts, based on our view that the strategy behind artist management is to provide a full range of services related to concert promotion and to expand our concert businesses. We have also slightly changed our definition of free cash flow this quarter, now titled free cash flow adjusted, in order to reduce confusion with other similar measures and to recognize it as a liquidity measure tied back to cash flow from operating activity. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2017 are revenue was up 19% to $1.43 billion, and AOI increased 25% to $92 million, both at constant currency. Free cash flow adjusted was $27 million. Free cash flow would have been $29 million under our prior calculation, so the difference is not significant. As of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.6 billion, up 34% compared to $1.2 billion last year. Growth in concerts and ticketing drove the revenue increase for the quarter. Concerts revenue was up 16% from higher show counts at stadiums and arenas, and ticketing revenue was up 23% from the increased primary ticket volumes in GTV, driven by concert events, as Joe outlined, all at constant currency. AOI for the quarter was up 25%, driven by strong growth at Ticketmaster, with ticketing AOI also up 25% for the quarter, and sponsorship & advertising AOI was up 10% from the increased online advertising, all at constant currency. Operating loss in the first quarter was $21 million, an improvement of 36% from the same period last year, and net loss was $33 million compared to a loss of $45 million in the first quarter of 2016, driven by the higher AOI. Moving to our key balance sheet items, as of March 31, we had total cash of $2.2 billion, including $671 million in ticketing client cash and $1.2 billion in net concert event related cash, with a free cash balance of $374 million. Cash flow from operations was $761 million compared to $517 million in the first quarter of 2016, with the increase driven by higher event-related deferred revenue. Free cash flow adjusted was $27 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $25 million last year on the same basis. Our total capital expenditures for the quarter were $57 million, with maintenance CapEx of $25 million and revenue-generating CapEx of $33 million, compared to a total of $25 million in the first quarter of 2016, with the increase driven by technology and venue enhancements. We currently expect total capital expenditures of approximately $220 million for the full-year 2017, with approximately 50% of that to be used for revenue-generating CapEx. For the full year, we estimate we will record approximately $60 million of accretion related to redeemable non-controlling interest. And lastly, as of March 31, our total net debt was $2.3 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 3.8%. Thank you for joining us today and we will now open up the call for questions, operator. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. Two questions, one on guidance, and then one on ticketing. Joe, can you clarify your comments on guidance? Did I hear that AOI is going to be up mid-single digits? It just seems like with a 1Q beat and a seasonally stronger 2Q and 3Q, that it would imply a more dramatic slowdown in 4Q. So I just want to make sure I got that correctly. And then on the ticketing side, I think one point of investor concern continues to be competition on the secondary market. And given kind of what you've been able to accomplish, can you just point to some of the things that you're doing that separates you from your competitors? And then out of the 40 counties that you're present in, can you remind us how many ticketing platforms you have and if this is a bigger focus for you? Thank you. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. I'll start with the guidance point, Amy. I was talking about the ticketing segment when I was talking about that point, which was that it's been a very strong Q1, because it was disproportionate to arenas and stadiums which tend to go on sale early. So it drove a very high Q1 performance. And then I was just saying, some of that for ticketing segment, not the overall business, was going to balance out for that guidance. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Amy, on ticketing. On ticketing, Amy, I mean, I think our numbers speak for it. We are continuing to grow our secondary business. That's pretty much a two-way race in ticketing. And as we've quoted before, Ticketmaster, historically was late to this party, and we've been making \u2013 the pie has been getting bigger and we've been increasing our market share continually year-over-year. And we're going to continue to do that for one reason, we have incredible primary scale at our store. So we have lots of customers that are going to come on a on-sale looking for a ticket in primary, that for 38 years we had a closed store, and now we have, most of the times, we have a secondary ticket option for that customer. So the more inventory we keep activating at our store called tm.com is how we're going to keep growing our GTA, more and more sports teams, venues and artists are adopting the idea of having a secondary option available in the primary purchase flow. So we think we have more inventory to activate and the double-digit growth we've been expensing year-over-year, we would expect secondary growth to be a strong growth driver for years to come. Second point is, we're only getting started in the European global side of the business, where we're seeing great growth, where we weren't last to get to the market, in most of those cities, Londons and UKs and Germanys, we are first or it's a still very new market that we're entering. So we think we have a lot of runway on a global basis to grow secondary business. About 40 countries we promote in, we would be in about 29. But let's call it 15 to 16 of strong ticketing markets right now for us. So you could see that there's great opportunity to keep driving ticketing growth through our content business in those 40 markets. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, and Amy, I would just point to Germany, I think it's a great example of how we think about the flywheel working with ticketing, which is we had an offer of ticketing business in Germany, but it wasn't a real substantial one. As we have gone into the promotion side there in a big way, and as Michael said, our Number 2 European market now, we're able to drive a lot of those tickets to the Ticketmaster business, which builds the brand, establishes it, helps to get other clients, and now has a much more \u2013 we now have a much more substantial business in Germany. So that's the model we like and we we'll continue to look for opportunities to replicate that. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. Couple of questions. Just help us understand your domestic versus international split. If you could talk about how much of your ticket sales \u2013 the number of tickets sold domestically versus internationally both on fee-bearing and non-fee-bearing, just to get a sense of that geographic split? And then also if you could provide some thoughts about how much of the sponsorship and advertising is domestic versus international? Thanks. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. Just on the tickets, first of all, what I said was is that North America is up 10%, international is up 11%. So, they're both up. That's the fee-bearing tickets, they're both up strong this quarter. We haven't historically broken out the non-fee-bearing. They tend to be much more North America driven, because they're tied in with season tickets. But that's not really obviously a material driver of our economics. And then on the sponsorship side, we don't give exact breakdowns, but over the course of the year, it's kind of a two-thirds:one-third, 60:40 type of split on the sponsorship, which pretty much aligns with our overall concert business split. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. If I could just add another separate question, where are you in the integrating Amazon as a ticket selling partner? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, in the UK, where it has always been an allocation market, we would be feeding them some tickets, I think maybe 3%, 4% tickets, most in the UK, allocates out to a host of retailers. So we would be doing that and allocating across multiple platforms. Ticketmaster is still selling the large majority of the tickets, but then we allocate out to lots of retailers in the UK. So that would be the only market where Amazon would be selling a few tickets. In the rest of the world, we continue to look at our APIs, top partner strategy, from Groupon to Spotify to other partners and we'll continue to look at the right incremental partnership. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brandon Ross with BTIG. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So taking a step back and kind of a follow-up to David's question there, how do you think in today's world about distribution of tickets to best serve sports teams and artists? Your willingness to work with Amazon seems to indicate that you think it makes sense to decouple the front-end, the retailing portion, from the back-end, the enterprise level? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : And would you consider letting StubHub plug into sell Ticketmaster tickets? Then I have a couple others. Thanks. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So, take that in a few pieces, Brandon. So first of all, we absolutely think of our business in two pieces as providing that enterprise software solution on the clients, and secondly as providing the e-commerce and selling the tickets. So, just organizationally and thinking about the business, we've absolutely thought about we have two missions, and we have to be great at both missions to ultimately achieve the market share and the positioning that we want to achieve. I think specifically on the commerce side, as you said, taking a step back, Ticketmaster's job is to sell every possible ticket for its sports teams, artists and other content. So the first step in that is our creating the best possible sites, online and mobile, that attract and convert fans. And Michael talked and gave some statistics around the continued success we're having in buildings that. And then the second step is finding additional sales channels to sell incremental tickets. And we've been doing this forever in the Ticketmaster business called Affiliates. It's the technology that now changes and makes that look a little bit differently. But the affiliates that we have today and the ones that we use our API with, the ones like the Facebooks and the Bandsintown, they act as marketing leads for us to then transact the tickets. And our studies have absolutely shown we drive incremental sales through those marketing leads. And then the second step for us is we're looking at other commerce sites that we're confident will sell incremental tickets generally against a different database, a different customer that they can reach on some sort of advantaged basis generally with a different value proposition. And I think Groupon is our most successful example here, where they've gotten a different ticketing offer to a different customer, and again, track and analyze the highly incremental sales force. So I mean rather than give a specific answer about any other specific player, really the point is, if we are convinced that we can sell incremental tickets for our clients, then we will look at any platform. But that is the basis by which we make that assessment. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Great. And then for Verified Fan seems to be pretty successful. Just a point of curiosity, why not use Facebook login for that and kind of let them do the work for you, since they're so proactive in cutting down who's a real person and who's not? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. Absolutely, we use the social profile as part of it. The challenge is that they're continually having to scrape and delete false accounts as well. And in the rush of an on-sale or over what could be a day or so, you don't want to be dependent on any single point. So we'll take a social sign-in along with other data, put it against our proprietary database against all of our fans, all of our fan data, and use our own scoring system to try to create what we think is the most fair, best way to get the tickets to the fans. And then I would also say that it's going to be a continually evolving process, because once the scalpers figure out your algorithm, if they can back into it, you have to update it, change it and continually renew it. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Great. And then just more of a housekeeping, on the guidance. The same guidance for overall AOI, is that still in line with historical rates as you said on the prior call? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. So, I don't think we've given guidance for the overall business. We gave guidance on sponsorships that that will continue at historical rates, and on ticketing, that will be mid- to high-single digit AOI growth. I think those are the two pieces we've given guidance on. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Thank you very much for the questions. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Brandon. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Tinker with Gabelli. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Hi. Thank you. Just couple of quick questions. You've mentioned Germany a couple of times. I noticed that CTS Eventim, they still refers to themselves as the European market leader. Given you've had an interesting history with them, what's your sort of relationship with them there, and would it be fair to discuss what you sort of think your market share is in Europe overall? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Always fun, John. I haven't looked at their latest data. They're obviously Number 1 in Germany. That would be the only place that they would be Number 1 in. We would be Number 1 across Europe on concerts and I would assume total ticket sales. But regardless, we're in 40 countries with scale and they are a very strong German company with some market expansion through Europe. But we're competitors. We compete on the concert and the ticketing side. Good news is the pie is growing for everybody. So I assume they're doing well, and we think we can pick up a lot more share in Germany and the rest of the world, regardless of what their activity is. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: And since I noticed that I think you resigned with Jay-Z, but it was very much positioned as a purely keeping involve \u2013 been able to \u2013 as the strongest company been able to pay the most to keep the best talent, and the 360 deal, is it totally over? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, we never officially talk whether we renewed Jay or not. That's just good speculation post that was running. But for the record, yes, we are not in the 360 business; we haven't been for years. We're in the long-term securing touring business. And Jay has been an incredible partner of Live Nation. And we hope to be in the Jay-Z, and assume to be in the Jay-Z touring business for a long time, where we both can do what we do best. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks. I know you're not breaking out Artist Nation anymore obviously, but can you, Kathy, can you talk at all about the impact that had on the combined entity now? Was it up, down, flat? That would be helpful. And then second, Joe, in terms of the second quarter being stronger than normal, can you discuss any impact that would have on the third quarter? Thanks. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Doug, we can't really break it out since it's something we're not really providing. And just remember, as we've talked about it, it's really just there to drive the overall concert business, and you'll see that overall impact in the full year. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: But it wouldn't be marginally up or down to make a difference to the core numbers you're reading, Doug. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And then on the Q2, Q3, I think the best way to frame this, Q3, look, the whole summer looks very solid, looks very strong, lots of growth. Q2, and frankly Q1 was \u2013 well, we talked about the big growth in attendance \u2013 is where we have seen and we are confident on the very high level of growth. We expect Q3 to be as good or better than last year. It's just that Q2 was even stronger. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions in the queue. So at this time, we'll go ahead and end today's conference. We appreciate your participation. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank you.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2017 conference call. Live Nation continued growing its business in the second quarter with revenue up 31% and AOI up 23% at constant currency and free cash flow up 42%. All three segments grew as we continued demonstrating the strength of our business model. Our concerts business is our flywheel, through July selling over 68 million tickets to shows this year, 12 million more tickets than at this point last year. This demonstrates that we have built the industry's most scalable and unparalleled live platform, bringing over 550 million fans in 40 countries to live events each year. With key metrics in these concerts, sponsorship, and ticketing pacing double-digits ahead of last year, we are confident that 2017 will be another record year of results for Live Nation. Starting with the concerts business; in the second quarter, we promoted over 7,000 shows for 24 million fans, an increase of 5.5 million fans from Q2 last year. As a result, for the quarter, we grew revenue by 36% and AOI by 52% both at constant currency. We extended our position as the leading promoter in the world as we delivered growth across all markets and venue types. We increased attendance in North America and international by 2 million fans each; and arenas, amphitheaters, stadiums, festivals, and theaters increased attendance by double-digits. As we attract more fans to concerts, we continue to focus on maximizing the revenue and profitability of each show. This starts with attracting more fans to each show and, during the quarter, we increased our average show attendance by 11%, with every venue type delivering higher attendance per show. Additionally, our food and beverage initiative at our amphitheaters continued to improve the onsite experience, driving increased spend per fan with programs ranging from increasing the number of points-of-sale to improved product offering to optimize pricing. As a result, we continue to expect to increase ancillary spend by approximately $2 per fan again this summer. Given the strong performance of our shows to-date and the pipeline of shows for the rest of the year, I expect us to grow our fan base to 80 million this year. And this, with additional fans, I'm confident that we will deliver strong growth in our concerts results, providing the flywheel to grow our sponsorship and ticketing business. In the sponsorships and advertising business, we again delivered strong growth this quarter with revenue up 32% and AOI up 23% at constant currency. Live Nation's ongoing success in growing its high margin sponsorship and advertising business is based on its unique scale and breadth in the live experience space. No other advertising platform can match our 80 million onsite engaged fans, over 550 million direct connections with fans attending events each year, and over 2 billion touch points across our digital reach. From festivals to branded content to exclusive access to tickets and events, the combined Live Nation Concerts and Ticketmaster platforms deliver an audience unmatched in music. Our growth continues to be strongly driven by our strategic brand relationships, with over 50 sponsors that each spend more than $1 million with us each year across our onsite and online platforms to reach that highly-sought-after Millennial customer. This group accounts for over 75% of our total sponsorship and, through the second quarter, their committed spend has grown by 25% to over $250 million. Festival sponsorship continues to provide the most attractive onsite platform. In the second quarter, we grew this category by 32% year-on-year. And for the full year, we are tracking toward mid-teens growth across our 95 festivals with over 8 million fans. Based on this strong start to the year, and now with over 90% of our planned sponsorship for the year under contract, I expect double-digit AOI growth in the low-teens for the business this year. Ticketmaster continues to demonstrate that it is the best marketplace for venues, teams, and artists to sell tickets to fans globally, with GTV growth on fee-bearing tickets up 8% for the quarter, at constant currency. Year-to-date, fee-bearing GTV is up 13%, and the past three quarters have been the highest transacted GTV quarters in the company's history. As a result, Ticketmaster's revenue for the quarter was up 11% and AOI up 2% at constant currency. Year-to-date, revenue was up 16% and AOI up 13% at constant currency, with quarterly timing impacted by the shift in concert on-sales as we discussed last quarter. Our success at Ticketmaster starts with providing fans with the best solutions to their ticketing needs. Building on our integration of primary and secondary tickets, we have now expanded our listings to also include secondary tickets to shows for which Ticketmaster is not the primary ticketing, all purchased in the same checkout flow. This has now increased the number of events we have listed by 35%, further leveraging the 120 million fans visiting our online sites per month. And as we expand our inventory, we continued improving the customer purchase process, helping us increase conversion by high single-digits on desktop and double-digit on mobile sites. As we increase conversion on mobile sites, we continue to see a strong shift in purchase behavior to mobile, with these sites with our apps accounting for 31% of our sales in the quarter, up 27% year-on-year. Along with the focus on fan experience, we're providing venues, teams, and artists with the additional tools and services to more effectively price and distribute their tickets. One of the services we uniquely provide is the range of distribution partners that can sell incremental tickets for our clients. For the quarter, these off-platform sales are up 11% and year-to-date they are up 21% to almost 7 million tickets. On the new product roadmap, we're seeing great success with our Verified Fan product, which enables artists to prioritize the distribution of tickets to actual fans utilizing a proprietary Ticketmaster scoring algorithm of fan behavior. Since launching the product earlier this year, we have worked with 50 artists in the United States and Europe to sell over 1 million tickets to true fans with dramatic reduction in these tickets than being sold on secondary sites. Overall, our Ticketmaster results are validating our dual strategy of delivering a great marketplace for fans to buy tickets while providing a great software solution to venues, teams, and artists looking to maximize the value of their events. By continuing to do so effectively, I expect us to deliver high-single-digit growth in ticketing AOI this year. In summary, 2017 is on track to be another year of growth and record results for the company. All the key indicators for our business, concert tickets sold for shows this year, contracted sponsorships, fee-bearing ticketing GTVs are on pace double-digits ahead of last year. And as a result, we expect each of our businesses to deliver record revenue and AOI this year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details on divisional performance this quarter. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. Live Nation Concerts' revenue in the second quarter was up 36% and AOI was up 52% both at constant currency. Our revenue growth was driven by a 29% increase in attendance for the quarter and in that North America was up 25% while international growth was 36%. Arena attendance in the second quarter was up 36%, with over 6.5 million fans attending these shows. Amphitheater attendance was up 14%, as we saw higher than normal pacing of shows in the Q2 this year. And following very strong stadium attendance last year, this quarter attendance was up another 29% with 4.5 million fans attending over 100 shows globally. Looking forward to the second half, as Michael said, we've already sold over 68 million tickets for shows this year through July, an increase of 22%. Our pipeline of shows in the second half, particularly stadiums and arenas continues to be very strong and we expect to increase our show count to over 28,000 this year for 80 million fans. And from a timing standpoint, coming off this very strong Q2 activity, we expect the majority of remaining fan growth to come in Q4 this year. AOI growth was also driven by our artist management business, now within our concert segment, as it had very strong quarter with increased terrain and other activity. With this momentum across the board, we expect continued strong growth in our concerts AOI for the year. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. Our sponsorship business benefited from our concerts flywheel, helping drive revenue up 32% this quarter, while AOI was up 23% both at constant currency. The sponsorship part of our business was particularly strong this quarter, with revenue up 37%, while online revenue was up 16%, again at constant currency. Our festival business played a large part in this growth and we're succeeding and expanding our sponsorship at festivals, as we increased sponsorship per fan by 6% through the first half of the year. Our mix shift also impacted sponsorship margins for the quarter, but we expect most of this to be just timing within the overall year. With over $300 million in sponsorship and advertising net revenue now contracted for the year, we're confident we will deliver AOI growth in the low-teens for the full year. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster revenue was up 11% and AOI up 2% both at constant currency. Here too, we are seeing the impact of our concerts flywheel as Q1 revenue was up 22% and AOI up 26% from increased concert ticket sales. For the second quarter, as we indicated on the last earnings call, ticketing saw lower growth as the concerts played out. That said, primary ticketing fee-bearing GTV was up 9% globally in the quarter, driven by international growth of 27% Secondary ticketing was down 2% for the quarter, coming off a very tough comp from being up 50% for the second quarter last year. The reduction was driven by the sports side which saw a decline as we didn't have the same post-season activity levels as we have last year. Our secondary concerts business continued to grow in the quarter, even as we successfully deployed pricing initiatives in our Verified Fan product to shift money out of secondary and into primary. This gives us confidence our integrated marketplace continues to be working and results through July support this, indicating we will deliver double-digit growth in the secondary GTV for the quarter. Finally, while ticketing margins were off a bit in the quarter from lower growth, for the full year, we still expect flat year-on-year margins. So, given all this, we expect to deliver high single-digit AOI growth for the full year, with most of the remaining growth for the year coming in the fourth quarter's concerts for 2018 go on sale. And in summary, more than half way through the year, we're confident that 2017 will be another year of record top line and bottom line results overall and for each of our businesses. We also expect record free cash flow of AOI conversion into free cash flow at historical rates. From a timing perspective, we expect Q3 to be a similar percentage of full year activity as last year and FX is becoming less of an issue with overall Q2 revenue and AOI impact of about 1% and current forecast indicating that full year overall revenue and AOI impact will be negligible. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting with our results for the second quarter, revenue was up 29% to $2.82 billion and AOI increased 22% to $221 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 31% to $2.86 billion and AOI was $223 million, an increase of 23%. As of June 30, our event related deferred revenue was $1.5 billion, up 31% from $1.2 billion last year. This level of deferred revenue is nearly double the amount we had in June of 2014 which is a great indication of how our flywheel has grown. Free cash flow for the quarter was $154 million, up 42% from 2016. Revenue growth in the second quarter was driven by concerts with an increase of 34% from higher show count and fan attendance in arenas and stadiums globally. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 31% from new sponsorship programs and growth in our online advertising business. And ticketing revenue was up 9% from higher primary volume, driven by concert ticket sales. AOI growth for the quarter was driven by a 51% increase in concerts AOI from higher show count and attendance in arenas as well as increased results in our amphitheater, theaters, and clubs. We also had AOI growth from higher management commissions as artists touring income was up. Sponsorship and advertising AOI increased 21% from strong growth in our sponsorship business and higher online advertising. Operating income in the second quarter was $113 million, a 53% increase over last year driven by growth in concerts and sponsorship AOI. Net income was $81 million, up from $38 million in the second quarter of last year. Interest expense for the quarter included $1 million of expense related to the refinancing of our $970 million term loan B facility. We reduced the interest rate from LIBOR plus 2.5% to LIBOR plus 2.25%, which we expect will reduce annual interest expense by approximately $2.4 million. Lastly, other income in the second quarter included net foreign exchange rate gains from revaluation of $4 million compared to 2016, which included a loss of $7 million. Moving to the results for the first half of the year. Revenue was up 25% to $4.23 billion and AOI increased 23% to $314 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 27% to $4.29 billion. Free cash flow for the first six months was $180 million, up 36%. All of our segments delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income, and AOI for the first six months. The majority of the revenue growth in the first half of the year was in the concert segment, largely from increased show count and attendance in arenas and stadiums. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 23% for the six months and ticketing revenue increased 15% from higher primary and resale volume of concerts tickets. AOI for the first six months was driven by our strong results across all three segments. Operating income was $92 million compared to $41 million last year, driven by the increase in AOI. And net income for the first-half of the year was $48 million compared to a loss of $7 million last year. For the six months, other income included net foreign exchange rate gains is $7 million compared to $1 million in 2016. For the full year, we currently estimate that the impact to earnings per share for the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest will be approximately $65 million. Moving to our balance sheet; as of June 30, we had total cash of $2.2 billion, including $704 million in ticketing client cash and $1 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $464 million. Cash flow from operations for the first six months was $804 million compared to $511 million in 2016, with the increase driven by our growth in AOI, higher deferred revenue, and the timing of the payment of liabilities. Our total capital expenditures were $116 million for the first six months, with 52% spent on revenue-generating items. We currently expect total capital expenditures for 2017 to be approximately $220 million, with roughly half on revenue-generating CapEx. As of June 30, our total net debt was $2.3 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 3.9%. Thank you for joining us today and we will now open the call for questions, operator? Operator : Yes, ma'am. Thank you. We first go to David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. You mentioned a higher than normal phasing (19:24) of amphitheater shows in Q2, but also that you're seeing increased fans per show at all venues. With that in mind, any sense what we can expect for amp attendance for the rest of the year, and then any guidance you can give around festival attendance also? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. This is Joe. On the amp attendance, I think as we said last quarter, most of our \u2013 after we had a big growth in our amphitheater attendance last year, most of the growth that we were seeing across amphitheaters, arenas, and stadiums this year was coming on the arena and stadium front. So we expect our overall, for the amphitheaters, to be fairly in line with last year on our attendance, which again has been big growth over the past few years. But what then we saw within that was a timing shift where we had more of our amphitheater shows in Q2 of this year relative to last year. That said, as you indicated, and as we've talked about, we've got greater attendance per show across the board and so continue to see very strong demand. Overall, on the festival side, again continued growth in our festival attendance. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, we saw the announcement in July that you had launched the Ticketmaster Presence API on a limited basis. It appears to be a pretty significant move towards digital ticketing. Can you talk a little bit about the product, potential applications and uses, including the ability for sports teams to substantially grow their fan database? Thanks. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. So, Presence is a big step in digital ticketing which is that it allows for teams to have their tickets to be fully digital throughout, not use barcoded tickets. This then allows the teams to know every individual who's coming, so rather than the usual I buy four season tickets and you only know me or if I buy tickets and take friends, it allows you, because the digital ticket is transferred much like an airline ticket that you have on your phone or even if it's paper, it's a personalized ticket that we can then start to know who all the people are. That's critical as the teams and content in general is more and more focused on knowing who their fan base is, what's their activity, how do I market to them at the event, gives them all of the data that they need for that. So, this is the first \u2013 not the first, this is one of the critical steps of having the access control that can tie into that digital ticketing. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : And our next question comes from Brandon Ross with BTIG. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. The NFL Exchange deal is up at the end of the year. I was wondering what your strategy with regard to the renewal of that deal is and how important primary and secondary relationships with the NFL teams and sports are more broadly? And then what \u2013 just one on the numbers for secondary, I think you said to expect the reacceleration from the Q2 growth number. Can you help us with where you expect to come in on secondary growth for the year? And if you still see this as a meaningful growth driver for you in the longer-term? Thank you. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. Brandon... Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Joe, I'll start and then I'll let you \u2013 I'll let you take the second part, Joe. Brandon, the NFL has been a long-term client and partner with Ticketmaster and we have two relationships you have to think about. We have a league relationship where we had an ongoing secondary partnership for the last 10 years with Ticketmaster NFL Exchange. And then we have 32 \u2013 31 actually, out of the 32 local venue team relationships with Ticketmaster. NFL doesn't control the local teams. Jerry Jones gets to pick whoever he wants to use for ticketing in his venue and we've been very successful over the years having close relationships with the stadiums, because we have a great product and also especially even after year like 2017, where we're delivering massive tours and content to those stadiums in the off season. So, we tend to be very good partners with the NFL stadium owners and we expect those relationship and our renewal to continue there. On the NFL secondary negotiation, we're feeling good that we're going to continue to be partners with the NFL and driving some of their secondary business. For us, overall, Joe is going to jump in on the exact number, but I think primary is over 80% of the volume if you added the two together when you look at the local teams versus the secondary league deal. So, continued very important that we renewed team-by-team, venue-by-venue using our great software upgrade as well as our content which helps on the venue front. So, we expect continued being within business with the NFL owners and we'll continue on our negotiation with the league for our secondary business. And Joe will take the second piece of that question. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. Brandon, as we said, when we looked at the second quarter, what we saw was, what we believe to be a market decline notably in sports, just because of comp year-on-year activity around some of the play-offs, some of the teams involved and some of the other big events, but concerts continue to grow in the second quarter, and as we are now almost half way into Q3 looking at the secondary performance, what we see is there's continued strong growth in the concert side in particular. And that is giving us confidence that we will return to double-digit growth in the secondary GTV in the third quarter. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Next question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies. Jaime Sue Morris - Jefferies LLC : Hi. It's Jaime Morris for John. There were a couple of high profile issues with festivals last quarter, Fyre and Pemberton. The outcomes probably suggest they're a little more complicated than some people think in order to be successful. Can you talk about, to what extent, you see any benefit or fallout for Live Nation and have you seen any impact, more broadly, on your attendance from this part of your business? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: It's Michael. We've seen no attendance affect at all. In the broad picture, we have over 95 festivals, globally. The business has been very strong on a global basis. Festivals continue to be a very strong high margin business for us. We see continued growth in festivals on a global basis, some cities have more festivals than others, but on global basis, there is tons of opportunity to keep growing whether it's country, EDM, indie, pop, et cetera. So we think huge opportunity in festivals continually for long time. We saw no consumer effect by the two festivals that went down. I mean, you are right, we do like highlighting those to the agents' managers of the world that there is a big difference when you work with Live Nation on the quality of the product, the guaranteed cash flow to the artist, the levels of a festival we're going to produce versus a rich kid with a plot of land wants to be a festival producer for the week. You're going to run into a few of those Pembertons and others that go down. But those are really, in the big picture, percent of nothing on an overall fan, nor artist, nor agent kind of effect. But overall, we continue to see. If you're well financed and you have the infrastructure, festivals can continue to be high margin. Good business, if you're in the one-off business with no scale or you have one or two of them, tough business to be in without scale. Jaime Sue Morris - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. Just one other, you've made some acquisitions on the ticketing side of the business over the past couple of years, can you give us an update on the integration or the rebranding to Ticketmaster and how they are performing relative to plan? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. This is Joe. I'm happy to. So, you're right, we've acquired a handful \u2013 a lot of what we've acquired, frankly, has not been necessarily to integrated it into Ticketmaster as a master brand. As we've talked on the call and elsewhere before, when we acquired Ticketmaster in 2010, it had followed a master brand, everything through one point strategy. In our view, as of in today's world, you had different needs of different segments and you have to super serve each of those segments. So whether that segment is our festival segment that needs to have camping and do-it-yourself, whether it's your club and theater segment, whether it's your do-it-yourself segment, remember the acquisitions we made have been to target each of those verticals and grow those businesses. And as we've talked in over a variety of calls, those businesses continue to grow and perform well as we add new customers and as we bring them into the Live Nation fold and then they provide services for Live Nation which has, obviously, been growing across all of our different venue-types globally. So those are working well. The other handful of acquisitions we've made have been more on the acqui-hire front, continuing to build our technology capability, helping us accelerate a number of things we've been doing that we've talked about such as the Presence, the Verified Fan, and a range of other programs that we've been able to launch much more rapidly in recent times than ever could have historically. Jaime Sue Morris - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Next question comes from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks and good afternoon. So, two questions. I guess, Joe, following up on the ticketing side, can you remind us the margin mix between or the margin differential between international ticketing and North America, and should we expect that the majority of growth on a primary side is going to come from the international segments going forward? And my second questions is, Live Nation signed a pretty high profile deal with Samsung today. Wondering how much or how big you think this market could be? You have a couple of VR deals now. And obviously, it could lead to pretty big numbers. Can you help us think through how you're monetizing this, either through advertising or maybe a rev share? Thank you. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. I'll take the first one. On the ticketing margin, so, generally speaking, international margins in ticketing are lower than North America margins, be it the service fees are lower, and so there's fewer dollars through the system and, ultimately, a lower margin. I wouldn't say that most of our growth is going to be coming from international though. The growth in ticketing, to a pretty good extent, follows a lot of our growth on the concert side and we've talked many times just at how much as we continue to get hyper local and continue to breakdown the pieces and go into every market that North America has continued to unlock a lot of growth over recent years and we expect that to continue as we continue our obsession on that hyper local that we've been pursuing. So, I wouldn't necessarily say it's going to be international. I think, this quarter, for all the reasons that we've talked about in terms of timing of concert on-sales and so on, you just have a bit lower growth and when you have lower growth, that's probably going to be, relatively speaking, lower margin as you look at the overall numbers. But, as Michael said and as we've indicated in the past, we think this year it will probably be right about in line on margins and ticketing for the full year as it was last year. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Amy, I'll jump in on the second question. We're very proud of this new focus over the last, I guess, two years called our Live Nation Studios, whether it's the documentary of Puff that we had on Apple TV, a documentary on Eagles of Death on HBO. We're going to continue to look for ways to amplify our live events, through documentaries, through streaming live \u2013 Zac Brown on Twitter, or Coldplay with Samsung in virtual reality. So, we think \u2013 there's two main reasons we're doing this. The first is always the more we amplify the event, the better we know it becomes in marketing \u2013 so, getting Zac Brown on Twitter, lots of the Facebook stuff live we've been doing, festivals. We know that if you can't make it to the event or there's 100 dates in this tour and you're looking at the first five or six online, we know that's a great way to drive conversion and purchase. So, obviously, live video, any version of that, getting to fans to either pre-sell future tours or get them really excited about next year's Lollapalooza, we think it's the way you need now to market your product. And then the second is, it's all around our sponsorship, Samsung and all of our other high margin sponsors. In order to service 900 sponsors, we always say, our proposition is about onsite to online. So, we've got to figure out ways to continually excite our customers and sponsors about not only the 80 million customers that we touch directly, but that we have ways to reach them outside of the venue and amplify that. And virtual reality in itself, we think, is an exciting tool for sponsors and artists. I don't know, Amy, at what point in time that on its own is a monetizable business, I don't know if people are going to charge to see Drake from their living room in a virtual reality setting. But as the leaders in the business, we want to stay ahead of it and continue to be the leaders in innovating around that. And, for now, we're more than thrilled to monetize it through Samsung and our advertising business and incremental ticket sales. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs. Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a question about ticketing growth in the quarter, maybe you could \u2013 sorry if this is kind of rudimentary, but could you just elaborate on \u2013 you had constant currency revenue growth of 11% in the quarter, but it only translated into 2% growth in AOI. Can you just describe sort of the dynamics that cause that to happen? And I certainly appreciate, maybe it's timing, the half year numbers look pretty good. But I just want to better understand the dynamics that drive that sort of discrepancy. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, it absolutely is, there is a chunk of it that is revenue recognition and just timing within quarters. So we talked a lot about the fact that we, in the first quarter, sold a tremendous number of arena stadium tickets which really drove up our level of recognized activity. Our amphitheater tickets which don't get recognized in Q1 then flow into Q2. So, there's just some math around the revenue recognition, expense recognition that's going to impact it. And then secondly, as we just grow the business and we add more verticals and we add more markets and we add more everything, your fixed cost is going to grow. Right? So, your fixed cost is going to grow, and then I think that what you see is, over the course of the year you kind of even out that fixed cost on a pretty stable basis against fluctuations in your revenue. So, I just think you have to look at it on a longer-term basis in the quarter, and we don't try to obsess over what we're managing the numbers for the quarter. Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. I guess \u2013 second question, you mentioned that you're pacing to add another $2 per fan on the sort of per cap spending. Could you help me understand, like, how the attendance at your owned and operated venues how that's sort of pacing, like, what sort of the absolute number you're looking for this year and maybe what's the kind of the growth rate pacing? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. As I've said, I think on the earlier message, our pacing in total for the year on amphitheaters is pretty much in line with last year, in terms of our total attendance. And again this is just the year-to-year. Last year, it was our amps that drove a lot of our fan growth and this year it's arenas and stadiums that are growing lot of our fan growth. So, no different than some of the quarterly fluctuations you see. You see some difference in terms of just where the growth is coming from on it. So, we're seeing though strong per cap growth against that, and again the per cap growth is coming as we continue to add more points-of-sale, focus on optimizing pricing, product selection, a whole range of initiatives that we have on the amphitheaters to continue to provide a greater experience, better service for our fans, generally translates into them spending more. Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Joe, I thought you, if I heard you correctly, threw out a reference to Artist Nation having a strong quarter. Last year, I think when you were still breaking Artist Nation out, did about $87 million in revenues. Is it fair to conclude, if I heard you correctly, that it was up double-digit this quarter. I'm just trying to (38:04) back out for kind of the true concert number. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, it is all concert number. It is \u2013 but, yeah, I think, it's fair to assume it is up double-digits and that we mentioned it because as we think about the overall growth of the concert business in Q2, that was a material component of it. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then, I mean, you had kind of suggested earlier in the year that timing was going to help the second quarter. But your \u2013 but it doesn't seem to be distracting at all from your big seasonal third quarter. I would assume that the mix of shows, obviously, given the summer amp and heavier festivals, will be different in terms of less impact from arena and stadium shows overall in the third quarter. So that may change some of the metrics in terms of attendance per event, et cetera. Is that a fair way to look at it? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, I think, what we said is, certainly not going to, we don't believe, detract from Q3. We said that we think that the majority of the remaining fan growth was coming in more Q4, so Q3 expected to be, in aggregate, kind of in line with last year in terms of the overall AOI as the portion of the year. So continue to show some growth overall, but again the majority of the fan growth now in Q4, in part because you have that shift of amp attendance from Q3 into Q2 that's then has, obviously, been fully made up for by arena and stadium activity in Q3. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So, maybe more detail than you want to try to model, but to give you the flavor. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : I'll get there somehow. Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Kyle Evans with Stephens. Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Your release alludes to expanding listings to include secondary tickets there that were not primarily sold by Ticketmaster. Could you help us think about how that might change the long-term competitive dynamic that you've got with StubHub and help us think about how that affects ticketing just longer-term? Thank you. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I think \u2013 I'll give you the strategy not so much the guidance, obviously, there were some key strategies. When we took over Ticketmaster, we had some fundamentals that we wanted to change from a historic closed platform, and those three strategies that we're bringing to life. The first strategy was to truly enter the secondary business, we weren't in it, enter it and stock it on the shelves at ticketmaster.com, so fans could solve their problem at 10 :01 (40:56) and that's been working well. Second was to build an API so we could start talking to the world, both outside and in. So to make the actual secondary business work, we needed to develop the API so you could list your product at our site. And now we talk a lot about distributed commerce and how we can link up to Spotify and Bandsintown, and other places where we can sell incremental tickets. And the third strategy was always about what that API is let the outside world post to Ticketmaster, get more inventory on the shelf whether you're a Ticketmaster customer or not. And again fundamentally, at Ticketmaster, when we started to reshape Ticketmaster, we really broke the business in two places. One was about the marketplace and what's right for the customer, and then, separate, what's the software that's servicing the client in the venue. And we've been rebuilding both of those with separate teams, so if you ran my marketplace, your number one objective would be to solve the customers' problem. They need a Justin Timberlake ticket at the STAPLES Center, it might not be the Ticketmaster venue, but we want to sell you that ticket, obviously because the more problems we can solve at our site, the better our traffic, our conversion remain. So with over 100 million unique users a month coming to our site looking for tickets, we now are able to list a substantial more amount of events and tickets and every time we now sell or convert one of those, that's incremental business to us. And we're at the beginning stages of that. We have \u2013 Joe can maybe jump in on some of the numbers in terms of the percentage of the shows or tickets that will be going up this year, but substantial increase in our inventory and continues to make tm.com a leading [technical difficulty] (42:46 \u2013 42:58). Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Operator? Sorry, guys. Michael's line had a little problem there. So, as Michael was saying, this \u2013 by doing this, we got about a 35% increase in terms of number of shows that we're able to list. So that, to us, continues to both have a platform to attract more fans and also leverage the 120 million fans... (43:21 \u2013 43:35) Unknown Speaker : Thank you. I notice that Amazon keeps hiring people in the music business, particularly on the international side. So, far they've only put on a couple of sort of sponsor-type shows, but how do you see that presence emerging? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Over to you, Joe. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think that they've obviously, there has been a lot of discussion, a lot probably in the press about what they're doing. We've seen the activity that everybody else has in the U.K. with testing some different things and we continue to be very consistent and simple in our view that our job is to sell every possible ticket. Michael talked about the continued growth of our open platform, selling nearly 7 million tickets in the first half alone. And we will, absolutely, work with anybody that we believe can sell incremental tickets for our concerts or for our sporting clients or others. So, we haven't announced anything. So, we're not there in terms of having any arrangements, but we continue to look for all ways that we can sell those incremental tickets. Unknown Speaker : Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. I was hoping you could provide some more color on where the sponsorship growth was coming from, are these some tack-ons to current contracts that are either adding some new regions or are these more regional sponsors that are coming on to these events? Are you getting more strategic deals? What the makeup of the growth that you're seeing? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. So, we talked about two main areas that are really driving the growth. The first is festivals, as we continue to add more festivals, but also more categories within our festivals, so we're driving rapid double-digit growth overall in our festivals, but also growing our festival \u2013 sorry \u2013 our per fan sponsorship at festivals. So it's a combination of including that \u2013 just continuing to grow the number of major festivals we have, but also more sponsors, more clients, more categories at those festivals. And then secondly is our strategic phase, which, we said, we continue to add a few customers, but really they're more than anything driving just a lot more spend. They're spending up 25% as we add a few more of them, so the big relationships that we have are continuing to see the effectiveness of our platform and looking for additional ways to use the myriad of our assets to reach their potential customers. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And then if I could ask a second question on the M&A front, you sometimes have some deals that kind of fly beneath the radar, but have you been doing anything in the regions you've talked about in the past where you had interest like Latin America, was there anything that's been going on, on the M&A front? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. I mean nothing that of substance. Sometimes we do a small bolt-on promoter or a small venue or acquisition in our current markets. But no, nothing of substance we've acquired in this year, continuing to look at Latin America and Europe and Asia. And we look at 100 major cities where live entertainment is growing and dynamic and we have lots of room to expand either ticketing concerts or festivals in those markets. So we think we have lots of runway for acquisitions that's accretive and will grow the flywheel. We're just patiently continuing to look for them around the globe. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. With no further questions in queue, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: All right. Thank you.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. Live Nation had its best third quarter ever and 2017 is on track to deliver another record year results across revenue, AOI and free cash flow. For the quarter, revenue was up 12%, AOI up 10%. For nine months to-date revenue was up 19%, AOI was up 16%, and free cash flow was up 15%. All our divisions, concerts, ticketing and advertising, each delivered their strongest quarterly AOI results ever. Our concerts business is our flywheel, attracting over 30 million fans to shows globally in the quarter, which then drove record results in our onsite ticketing and advertising business. Through October, we have sold 80 million tickets for concerts in 2017, up 20% year-on-year. With our strength in concert attendance growth, we are also seeing similar success in onsite sponsorship, ticketing businesses giving confidence that 2017 will be another year of record results for Live Nation overall and for each of its divisions. Digging deeper into concerts, strong global demand for concerts through the third quarter drove a 16% increase in attendance to 65 million of fans at our 20,000 shows in 40 countries. While growing our show count, we've increased the revenue generated by each show. We do this first by growing attendance per show, which is up 6% overall so far this year, again led by arenas and stadiums, each delivering strong increases in fans per show. And secondly, we work with artists to better align the pricing for their best tickets with market value. This yielded an average 9% increase in front-of-the-house ticket prices across our amphitheaters, arena and stadium shows so far this year. This summer, we also saw the benefit from onsite initiatives at our amphitheaters, increasing our average revenue per fan by 9% to almost $24. This is now a nearly 20% increase over the past two years, as we have driven substantial improvements across food and beverage, VIP and parking. With the success of the concert flywheel, we're promoting more shows for more fans, more effectively pricing and selling tickets and delivering a better experience than ever. As a result, we will spend over $5 billion producing concerts this year, making Live Nation far and away the largest financial partner to musicians. With this, we expect to deliver record results in our concerts business this year. This growth in concert demonstrates the power of Live across the globe, as more fans are attending live shows and making it a top entertainment choice and the only non-duplicatable music option. In our high-margin sponsorship business, we have continued double-digit growth this year with revenue up 20% and AOI up 15% year-to-date, as we delivered our best quarterly results ever for our sponsorship business. With over 1,000 sponsors across our onsite and online platform, Live Nation is a global leader in music sponsorship, providing brands with opportunities to reach our core audience. Onsite sponsorship continues to be a key growth driver and year-to-date, our festival sponsorship is up 20%, while our sponsorship per fan is up 8% as we continue to find innovative way at scale to connect brands with over 8 million fans attending 95 festivals worldwide. Our other key growth initiative continues to be deepening and broadening our strategic brand relationships with over 50 sponsors each spending more than $1 million on our platform from onsite to fan direct engagement. Collectively, the committed spend by this group is up 24% to over $275 million for the year, accounting for approximately 80% of our overall sponsorship and advertising. With 95% of our expected advertising revenue for the year now contracted, we expect full AOI growth in the low teens for the business. Ticketmaster continues to build its position as a global ticket marketplace leader with 14% growth to-date in global fee-bearing GTV. Ticketmaster will deliver almost 500 million tickets worth approximately $28 billion GTV across 29 countries this year, making it the world's largest such marketplace. And the success of the marketplace is stronger than ever, as all three quarters in 2017 have been amongst our top 10 quarters ever. Underlining this growth is our product innovation and this has been an important quarter for us as we have scaled our Verified Fan product and announced our first league-wide conversion to digital ticketing. Ticketmaster's Verified Fan has developed a proprietary process, leveraging algorithms which separates true fans from bots and delivers the tickets to fans and drive a 90% reduction in the number of tickets ending up on the secondary market. During the third quarter, we substantially scaled the product and have now worked with over 60 artists and Broadway shows, including Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, Hamilton and Bruce Springsteen on Broadway. As a result, by the end of the year, I expect we will deliver 3 million tickets to Verified Fans, saving them $100 million relative to buying on secondary sites after bots got the tickets first. We also announced our digital ticketing rollout with the NFL in September, and starting next season, all NFL game tickets will be digital. This will allow us to identify the fans attending the games, understand in much greater detail the behavior of these fans, reduce fraud and frustrated fans, and work with our clients to create new profit streams in ticketing. As importantly, these products come as we have a continued success in our core operations. Our mobile and desktop platforms continue to provide an improved online experience with 34% growth in mobile ticket sales this year and double-digit improvements in conversion on both mobile and desktop. And at the same time, our open strategy continues selling more tickets for clients off-platform, up 20% year-to-date with almost 10 million tickets sold. Overall, Ticketmaster's results are validating our dual strategy of delivering a great marketplace for fans to buy tickets, while providing the greatest value to venues, teams and artists, looking to control their tickets and maximize the value of their events. By continuing to do both effectively, I expect us to deliver high-single-digit growth in ticketing AOI this year. As we approach the end of 2017, we're confident that our strong performance will deliver another year of record top line, AOI, and free cash flow. All of our businesses, concerts, advertising and ticketing, have delivered growth year-to-date and based on key operating metrics, we expect each to deliver record revenue and AOI for the full year. As we look forward, we see tremendous opportunity to continue to seek global consolidation of our concerts and ticketing business and for further growth in advertising and ticketing from the concerts flywheel. With that, I will turn over to Joe to take you through additional details on divisional performance. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first Concerts. Live Nation Concerts revenue in the third quarter was up 11% and AOI was up 18%. This growth was driven by a 10% increase in show count and almost 30 million fans attending our events in the quarter. So far this year, we've had 65 million fans attend our concerts, up 9 million from this time last year. Our international markets have been particularly strong this year adding 5.5 million fans, while the U.S. has grown by 3.5 million. Arenas and stadiums have driven much of this growth globally adding 7 million fans, while festivals and theaters and clubs also contributed to these increases. Underlying its growth is an expanding group of artists touring with us, many of whom are now touring across multiple markets or globally, including six artists who have each performed in front of over 1 million fans so far this year. U2, Coldplay, Guns N' Roses, Depeche Mode, Bruno Mars and Metallica all of whom we work with globally. Given ticket sales through October for shows this year, we're now expecting to have almost 85 million fans attend 29,000 shows in 2017, tremendous growth from our 71 million fans last year. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. Sponsorship and advertising revenue for the third quarter grew by 16% and AOI was up 13%. Our growth for the year has been well-balanced between sponsorship and online advertising with both parts of the business growing revenue and AOI in the double digits year-to-date. From a geographic perspective, both North America and international markets delivered similar AOI growth with international markets delivering the majority of sponsorship growth and North America accounting for much of the online advertising growth. Finally, Ticketmaster, for the quarter, Ticketmaster revenue was up 17% and AOI was up 4%. Global GTV was up 6% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date, driven by fee-bearing GTV, which was up 19% and 14% for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Primary GTV, which accounts for approximately 90% of overall fee-bearing GTV was up 18% for the quarter and 14% year-to-date. Approximately 75% of this GTV growth is driven by concerts, much of which is Live Nation shows. Most of the remaining growth is from the art segment driven by the touring of Hamilton and other highly in-demand shows. Secondary GTV was up 29% for the quarter and is now up 15% year-to-date. Here again concerts and the arts are the greatest drivers of our growth, together accounting for about 75% of the increase year-to-date. Overall, our Ticketmaster marketplace is performing well for fans, as Michael noted. More specifically, our marketplace continues to attract more fan visits, 36% for the quarter and 28% year-to-date to almost 4 billion visitors this year. The shift to mobile continues its rapid progress, now accounting for 34% of tickets sold in the third quarter. And as part of the shift to mobile, we increased our installed base of apps to over 40 million, up 38% from this time last year, which positions us well for a shift to digital ticketing. As Michael said for the full year, we expect ticketing AOI growth in the high-single digits. And while margins move around from quarter-to-quarter, excluding one-off legal fees, we expect full year margins in line with last year. In summary, we're confident that 2017 will be another year of record revenue and AOI results overall and for each of our businesses. We also expect to grow our free cash flow enabling us to continue investing in the businesses for ongoing growth. On FX, Q3 revenue and AOI were positively impacted by about 1% with the strengthening of the euro and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. In terms of seasonality, we expect Q4 as a percent of full year AOI to be a little less than it was last year. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon everyone. Starting with our results for the third quarter, revenue was up 12% to $3.6 billion and AOI increased 10% to $335 million. Free cash flow adjusted for the quarter was up 4% to $253 million. As of the end of the third quarter, our concerts-related deferred revenue was $774 million, up from $417 million at the same time last year and includes tickets sold for shows next year. The majority of our revenue growth in the third quarter was driven by concerts, with revenue up 11% from higher show count and attendance globally across arenas, stadiums and theatres and clubs. Ticketing revenue was up 17% from increased ticket volumes, driven by the high demand for concerts. And lastly, sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 16%. AOI growth for the quarter was driven by an 18% increase in concerts AOI from improved operating results of arenas and stadiums. Sponsorship and advertising AOI increased 13% from new sponsorship programs and higher online advertising. And ticketing AOI was up 4% driven by increased ticket sales for concerts. Operating income in the third quarter was $201 million, a 5% increase over last year driven by AOI growth in sponsorship and concerts. Net income was $136 million, up 23% from $111 million in the third quarter last year, driven by the growth in our AOI. Acquisition expenses increased by $18 million in the quarter due to changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration. And income tax expense increased by $12 million for the quarter from our earnings growth internationally. Now, the results for the nine months. Revenue was up 19% to $7.8 billion and AOI increased 16% to $648 million. Free cash flow adjusted for the nine months was $434 million, up 15% from prior year. Revenue growth in the nine months was driven by concerts from increased show count and attendance in stadiums, arenas and theaters and clubs. Ticketing revenue was up 16% from increased primary and retail ticket volume driven by concerts. And sponsorship and advertising grew by 20%. AOI growth for the nine months was driven by double-digit growth in AOI across all three business segments with the largest part of the increase driven from higher concert show activity. Operating income was $293 million compared to $232 million last year. And net income for the nine months was $185 million compared to $104 million last year due to our improved operating results. Income tax expense increased $16 million as we continue to grow our international business profitability. For the nine months, our net foreign exchange rate gains included in other income increased by $8 million compared to 2016. For the quarter, we recorded $21 million of accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest with respect to the calculation of earnings per share. For the full year, we currently estimate that this accretion will be approximately $75 million. And diluted earnings per share for the quarter and the nine months were $0.53 and $0.62, respectively, the highest for each time period in the history of the company. Moving to our balance sheet. As of September 30, we had total cash of $1.8 billion, including $640 million in ticketing client cash and $513 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $648 million. Our free cash increased due to the growth in AOI along with timing of acquisition activity in 2017 so far. Cash flow from operations for the first nine months was $417 million compared to $120 million in 2016, driven by our higher AOI, increased deferred revenue for future events and the timing of payment of liabilities. Free cash flow adjusted for the nine months as a percentage of AOI is in line with last year. The conversion of AOI to free cash flow for the quarter is off a bit due to bad debt expense last year that reduced AOI, but didn't impact free cash flow. Our total capital expenditures through September 30 were $172 million with 52% spent on revenue-generating items. We currently expect total capital expenditures for 2017 to be approximately $220 million with roughly half on revenue-generating CapEx. As of September 30, our total net debt was $2.3 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 3.9%. We also recently received an upgrade from Moody's on our corporate rating from the B1 to Ba3 and on our senior secured facility and bond to Ba1 and B1, respectively. Thank you for joining us today. And we will now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will take our first question from Brandon Ross with BTIG. Please go ahead. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Joe, I know you don't like to talk about margin percentages, but I'm going to start off with a question on that. For the quarter, you had pretty huge top-line growth there. AOI growth was about 4%. You said for the year to expect flattish margins. Can you just speak to what kind of pressured that margin percentage in the quarter? You, I think, alluded to legal fees in the supplemental. Can you just kind of tell us if that's going to be something that's ongoing? And on Concerts, I think your biggest AOI dollar contributor in the quarter came from there. And you've always kind of said margin growth isn't something to count on in the Concerts division, but it's something that's clearly been happening. If you strip out the per cap expansion, are you growing margin dollars \u2013 AOI margin dollars through some of those initiatives that you mentioned such as pricing the house? And is that an opportunity for margin dollars going forward? Or is that just contributing to the overall flywheel? Thanks. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. I'll take them in reverse order. So on the concert side, yes, obviously, as you said, the per cap growth are the largest contributor to the margin increases on the concert side. I think when you look at the other initiatives, which is both more people at the concert and higher pricing, obviously, since those flow through more directly, they are going to be beneficial to the margin. I think the point that I've always made on the concert business is just when you start with the 90-10 with the artists, you're constrained on where those margins can get to, not that we don't continually work and strive to improve them. And so, I think in the concert side, you're seeing this year, this quarter, the fruit of a lot of work that's been going on for a while, that continue to prove the economics of that business. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And also, just the mix of \u2013 we think the concert business has got a great flywheel, onsite, hospitality, huge part of how we're going to keep growing the company. But we also keep growing the business overall on the touring and the concert side, which is the 90-10 part of the equation. So as you're growing your higher margin onsite, beer, food and beverage, no matter how much you grow that, if you do the U2 tours of the world and that grows, when you put those two together, it's hard to move the overall net concert margin. So we just always wanted to be realistic that we're going to continue to grow the onsite, monetize the concert business and lots of runway left. But as you're also growing the global concert, ticket revenue grows, you won't see it so much in margin as you will in AOI cash flow over time. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : And was Artist Nation a contributor \u2013 has that been a contributor positively for you guys this year? Since you don't kind of break it out, I'm just curious. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes. I mean it's a high margin in theory business, because it's got no real costs. So it's a higher margin business. It's been fairly stable contributor of AOI to the business. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And then Brandon, on ticketing, again, first the context, we've long said, we don't try to micromanage the results of each division on a quarterly basis. We think that is not in our shareholders best interest. We absolutely look at it on a full year basis. This quarter, we had a handful of things going on, some mix as it relates to international versus North America, some mix within specific customers that were particularly active, and then, as I said, the one-off legal fees. But again, to reiterate the guidance that I gave is that for the full year, absent the one-off legal fees, we expect that our margins would be flat year-on-year. So, I wouldn't have characterized it as you did in terms of the pressure or decline. Those one-off legal fees are associated with the lawsuit that we have underway with Songkick that has been somewhat in the press and disclosed. And we expect, hopefully, to get that resolved and move on, but in the near term, there is a bit of costs associated with that. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Great. Could you size that very quickly? And then I'm done (23:22)? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, we're not going to give specific numbers on it. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Okay, thank you. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: The structural \u2013 the question that Brandon has answered on structural, right, we're growing the business, incredible margin. There's nothing that happened this quarter that's structurally going to change our margin business over time. We continue to renew, drive the business and, overall, we'll meet our margin expectations for the year given a quarter one-off here and there. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll go next to David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. Just a few questions on the recent NFL deal. The release said that Ticketmaster would validate tickets on other NFL license marketplaces. Is this something where you'd expect to get a fee for every ticket validated? And then can you walk through how this deal impacts the sale of primary tickets both for NFL games and then for concerts at NFL stadiums? Thanks. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Joe will take through the \u2013 I mean, Joe will take you through the overall Ticketmaster strategy for the last two years we've been outlining and how this is a fulfillment of that. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. So, I mean as we've been talking for a while, Ticketmaster's job is twofold; first and foremost, to provide venues, teams, artists with a great software-as-a-service platform; and secondly, to have a marketplace that is the best place to sell tickets. And as part of that, our open strategy which is making sure on behalf of those teams and artists, to the extent that tickets aren't selling on our platform, that they're selling connected to Ticketmaster in a way that we can still benefit from some of the economics. So the big thing with the NFL deal is, is it's the first move to all-digital ticketing. So, for the first time, every ticket that's done for an NFL game will be a digital ticket, which means we can understand who the fans are, we can understand how those tickets trade, we can start to monetize what happens on other marketplaces, which hasn't historically been done. So I think the way that we think about it is, first and foremost, when the other licensed marketplaces of the NFL have a secondary sale, there are economics that come to the NFL and Ticketmaster for validating those tickets. That's part of what we've always talked about in the past in terms of that money sitting outside of content and Ticketmaster's P&L and the desire to start to shift some of that money, so that those who are spending to put on the games and other events start to benefit from it. So, that's really the underlying piece of it. In terms of primary, our expectation is, is every primary ticket continues to be available on Ticketmaster. To the extent that we can sell incremental tickets and the teams are looking for other avenues to sell incremental tickets, then Ticketmaster will absolutely work with other platforms on an open basis to make it available for \u2013 some of the tickets available for sale on those platforms as well. And to be clear, the deal with the NFL is around the NFL games. And so, as we're talking about the validation or anything with primary, those are the events that we're talking about. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just shifting a bit. On your ancillary spend, can you say where you are with onsite per fan at your festivals or even how that's tracked year-to-date relative to your amphitheatres? Thanks. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. The festival sales per fan continue to do well. It's a much more fragmented and differentiated. As we've said for a while, our first focus is really getting the amphitheatres, which tend to be a more consistent set of 40-odd buildings that we control with one food and beverage provider and similar tours, similar experiences across the portfolio. So, that's been our primary focus over the past couple of years in terms of driving the numbers. Because our festivals are much more spread geographically, genre, whether the audience is over 21, under 21, more distributed in terms of how the food and beverage is provided, the numbers don't flow as easily. And as we're getting the amphitheaters further along, we're turning more of our attention to festivals, but we're happy with how they've been progressing in the recent years given what we've been able to do with them. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to John Tinker with Gabelli. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Can you hear? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Kind of. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Hello. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Can hear you now. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: I'm sorry, bad line. I noticed that the international fans is particularly strong. Are there any countries which are really sort of kicking in right now or is it evenly distributed or are you focusing on any one particular market? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. I think it \u2013 the numbers suggest our thesis on why this business will do well continually, it's a global business now. An artist \u2013 superstar artist can travel most countries in the world and sell out arenas or stadiums. So whether you have U2, deep in South America selling out stadiums to artists in the Eastern Asia selling out. So I just think it's continuation of a artists global unlocked fan base and a global growth on an international basis, we'll see for years to come as artists continue now to look not just to the U.S., but to the entire globe to monetize their tour. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Okay. And this is slightly delicate question. With some of the terrible events that have been happening, what does this do to your potential liability or cost of insurance? How are you thinking about managing it? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. The reality of our business over years is that there has been incidents like this. In the big picture of global number of shows that happen every day, it's still 1% of the business, if you want to look in terms of scale. So, I think, we're continually \u2013 whether it was Manchester or certain event over time, the industry in general has gotten better and better at whether it's onsite security. You see it in arenas, you see it in stadiums. I think the industry in general has been doing a better job over the last five years of upgrading its onsite. For us, as horrible as Vegas was, the business is very resilient. We're seeing increased ticket sales since September. We've seen no effect at all on the business from the day on \u2013 the day after. Again, because we are a global business, we have such diversity that on a global basis, we didn't see any effect. Now, we're going to continue to make sure we're the best in terms of security onsite, something we always are investing in. We think the digital ticket is an important piece because we think it's going to become more and more important that we know exactly who was at that show and that we have a means to talk to them. So, if the bar code goes away and we have a digital ticket, we have a much better chance to figure out who was going to the show, have a faster response time. So, we think technology will help a lot of ways bring even more high sophisticated ways to secure and bring safety to the events. We don't assume that we're going to see any change in the consumer or artist perspective on the show to-date, and we'll keep investing in overall security. But we don't see any bottom-line change to our cost structure, insurance or revenue in terms of demand at this point. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to David Joyce with Evercore. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. A couple of questions emanating from the NFL deal. First on Presence as an upgrade to the platform, what should we think about in terms of the roll outs until you get all digital on ticketing; first, in North America; and then, how far that can go internationally? And what's involved from an investment perspective to do that from here? And then, secondly, with this new \u2013 the agreement with NFL, seems like you have the ability to share data on the end user. Is that something that could be applicable to other platforms that might tap into your API, like an Amazon that you (32:43) have some sort of a mutually beneficial deal? Thank you. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. As far as Presence, just Ticketmaster already is in the access control business. If you go to a Ticketmaster building today with your ticket, you're going to walk up and someone's going to scan it and that bar code and that's going to hook up to our back system. That currently is our system, we would be supplying those venues with those scanners and hardware, et cetera. The new Presence system is much cheaper hardware overall for us to implement. So as we're updating venues and providing them with scanning systems, we'll be changing that access control into our new Presence model, which is overall cheaper for us on a fixed cost basis. Obviously, when we announced the NFL going to be digital by 2019 on stadiums in the U.S., that gives you a pretty good indication that we're ready for primetime. We'll be rolling it out next year into 2018 and 2019 across all major stadiums and arenas that are Ticketmaster driven. So, we're ready for a fairly aggressive rollout across America and we think, yes, there's a whole bunch of good benefits around this, gives the artist and the sports team much more control of the ticket. It controls how they want to price that ticket and how that ticket ultimately is used on site. Gives us great data about those four people that went to the show versus the one that bought it, gives us a way to engage with that customer on site and ongoing. So, we think that the data that Presence on the digital ticket unlocks really now starts converting our business from \u2013 to-date, we're in the delivery of bar codes. Presence lets us get in the delivery of looking at each fan as a data point in itself. And with that combined in rich data we think it helps our business immensely, drives our sponsorship business to new levels when we can really have the next level of depth around who was at these events and who they brought and have a correspondence engagement with them. So, we think it's the foundation to a big piece of our future on unlocking all of those customers and we think we have a bunch of different ways and products in the road pipe \u2013 in the pipe on how we'll monetize that data. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research Partners. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Couple of things. Joe, I'm trying to reconcile your guidance on tickets for the year, and the show count is pretty consistent with what you've said in the past with your comment that the percentage AOI in the fourth quarter should be a little lower than a year ago. Now, I realize you've had some big quarters here year-to-date. So, is there anything unusual about the mix of shows in the fourth quarter or is it a function of the fact that you have had such a big year so far to-date? And then I've got a follow up. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think it's more a function of the tremendous year we've had so far, and in particular just the great set of stadium shows, in particular, that tend to be our largest shows. So over the summer months, I think that's been a big spike, as we've talked about, really driving a lot of the attendance growth. I don't think we see Q4 as being particularly different from traditional Q4s in terms of our content. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then a question for Kathy. You mentioned an $18 million swing in acquisition expenses. Was that a reversal of prior \u2013 I mean, I'm trying to get a handle on what that is, because it looks like it was a fairly significant contributor to your AOI calculation, if I looked at it correctly? Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Well, correct. So what that is, is just the cost of earn-outs that we do on acquisitions where we have contingent consideration payments later. And so, those calculations will adjust based on how those businesses are doing and projections of the future business. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : So, in terms of some of the cost of services in the segments that would be reflected above, and then you sort of reconcile it below, is that fair? Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Correct. When you're looking at the operating income for the segments, it goes into the SG&A costs and then it comes out in the AOI calc (37:27). Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hey, Ryan. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Just want to follow-up on Verified Fan. So it sounds like you're targeting about 3 million fans this year. Where can Verified Fan ultimately go over time? And what does that ramp look like? Is there still a lot of education process that needs to go on or are artists more and more willing to kind of signup for that process? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Again, we think Verified Fan just incredible runway ahead of it for Ticketmaster. I mean, we've been working hard with Ticketmaster the last few years on some core products. Obviously, we've talked well about our new platform for the venues, which is working well. We've talked about opening up the platform to give clients and ourselves flexibility. Obviously, the other piece we've talked about on addressing is how do we make sure we really understand this whole $8 billion of dynamic, dollars and how does content better capture it. Well, to capture that dollars, there is a few angles. There is no one \u2013 not one shot at it. The first is, how do you price the show better and that's just a function of how willing the artist is to dynamically price it, but artists are more and more willing to look at a lot of our algorithms and pricing dynamic tools to price the house and capture some of it. So that's the best angle is work with the artist on day one on pricing. The second piece is, once you kind of figure out how to price the house better from the top to lower prices in the back, is then with the artist how do you make sure now if that artist has committed to those price points, can you give that artist the opportunity to actually deliver those price points to the fan. That was the piece that was missing when we sat down with fans \u2013 with artist. There is no artist that's dying to put tickets on a secondary platform as a solution. That isn't how they build their brands with their fans. What they want to do is figure out how to price it right and then make sure their fans actually have a shot to buy the ticket, not deliver it to the on-sale, have the scalper buy it, and their fan in Boston ends up paying 3 times the price. We believe for Ticketmaster to really turn around its kind of business with the artist and really be artist-centric, Verified Fan was a core product development. So, if you look in this last year, to be sitting here this far with Taylor Swift, and Bruce Springsteen on Broadway to just announce yesterday U2 doing its entire U.S. tour on a Fan Verified, the list is just now growing by the day. I mean, we have yet to meet an artist when we sit down with them and say, are you interested in making sure your fan can get your ticket at the price you set? I mean, where do I sign-up is the answer, of course. So we think we really pulled a really strategic kind of zig versus zag in the marketplace here. While everyone was obsessed with secondary business, our clients are actually obsessed with pricing the house better and then locking down that price point. We think Fan Verified and then you add on presence from the digital perspective are a real important combination for these artists of the future, who now believe they have some shot at controlling and delivering to their fans the price point at the exact price they want. And so, we think this is a pivotal product \u2013 suite of products that we've developed in Ticketmaster. It's under a new division within Ticketmaster called Artist Master where we have a new leadership team waking up every day, making sure that we can deliver artist products, so the artists can deliver their tickets to their fans at better pricing and at the price they want. So, we think it's a unique proposition and lots of runway ahead, and a real pivotal positioning for Ticketmaster to really look at the artist and deliver their needs. And ultimately, that's great for their business as no one else is really able right now to deliver that ticket at their price. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And it seems like the artist buy-in is definitely there. Is that maybe somewhat restrictive in terms of educating the consumer about Verified Fan and how to use it? Is that where it maybe go slower than, I guess, going forward, until that education process happens? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. No, we haven't seen that at all. I mean I think our \u2013 when you sit down with U2s and Taylor Swifts of the world, I think they're the best brand managers in the world, right. So, they are very, very astute on what is the price, not what's the most they can charge. That's not how they built these global brands. It's what's the price that makes sense for the production and the cost of the show and fair to the fan and how do I make sure that my fan has a shot to buy that ticket. The system is not perfect yet, but I'd say this was a real monumental movement where the artist has absolutely control in implementing this tool and some of the cost of delivering a ticket directly to a fan could come at the expense of transferability. But I think that the artist at times is willing to make that trade-off in terms of delivering that ticket direct to the fan. And to-date, we've had great success at that. The only complaints we've seen is from the scalper, not the fan. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: That's great to hear. And then, I guess, just if you could reflect back on the decision to kind of open up the API. You got 10 million ticket so far through kind of off-platform, how would you \u2013 I guess where did you see that when you made that decision that it's growing ahead of expectations or about where it should be? Just any color there would be great. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, I think we should be \u2013 we're very proud and we're bragging on the NFL deal. I mean, Joe and I, and Jared, who run Ticketmaster, can be judged on that NFL deal. When we took over Ticketmaster, if we had stayed the exact course, that NFL deal wasn't getting renewed, because the market has changed over the years, and Ticketmaster had a very close platform for many years and, as we say, was in the no business. And our competitors knew it, and SeatGeeks and others, that was their primary strategy, to talk to content about being open. So we knew years \u2013 a few years ago, it was fundamental that if we were in the software business for concerts and ticketing and venues and sports, we had to provide them with more flexibility. And we're thrilled that the software and the platform delivered as we wanted and we've been able to sit down this last year and deliver a big renewal like the NFL and a bunch of renewals this year that are all hinged on our ability to look at a venue and a sports team and give them flexibilities that they may need to distribute some tickets to different partners to drive their business. We didn't want to be in the \u2013 you can't, on Tuesday, when you have no \u2013 you have a bunch of tickets left over and you need to distribute them to Groupon or whoever it is, that we couldn't enable that. So, we think that the test of is our strategy working isn't even the 10 million tickets. It's how has the renewal rate at Ticketmaster excelled over the last couple of years, as we've fixed and now fixed our software from green screen to now actually starting to deliver leading-edge technology from open source to Verified Fan, and we see it in the renewal rates on our core business is the net output of the better product. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. That's great color. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And that will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank you.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead sir. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 conference call. I will make my comments today excluding the 2017 impacts of the $110 million legal settlement to keep our year-over-year numbers comparable. Live Nation delivered it's seventh consecutive year of record results Live Nation delivered its seventh consecutive year of record results. Revenue was up 24%, AOI up 15% and free cash flow was up 21%. All our divisions concerts, sponsorship, and ticketing delivered their strongest AOI results in the history of the company. We continue to see the tremendous power of live events with strong consumer demand and robust supply of new and established artists hitting the road from clubs to stadiums. Live is truly a unique entertainment form that cannot be duplicated and creates a lifetime memories that fans are craving for more than ever in this experienced economy. We believe the live business will continue to have strong growth for years to come as fans globally drive demand, artists are touring more, and sponsorship and ticketing benefit from the concerts flywheel. Live Nation continued to grow its global market share in 2017, adding 15 million fans globally for a total of almost 86 million fans, driving concerts revenue up 26% and AOI up 24%. Across all of the artists we work with, we invested $5.6 billion to promote 30,000 shows in 40 countries, with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists in music. Fans, more than ever, find the live experience from club shows to arenas to festivals, a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artists and share the experience with other fans. In the U.S. alone, over the past 10 years consumer spending on experiences has grown $5 billion per year, and we believe this ongoing trend will continue driving a structural increase in demand for concerts globally. In 2017, we built our leadership position across our business, with double-digit fan growth in both North America and internationally, and across arenas, stadiums, festivals, theaters and clubs. In addition to growing our show count and attendance, our pricing and on-site initiatives also continued to grow our AOI. Average ticket prices for our shows increased by 5% in 2017, amounting to over $250 million as artists more effectively captured the true value from their shows. Once at the show, average per-fan spending grew as well. At our amphitheaters, spending grew by 9% to over $24 per head as we added more high-end products, improved the quality of our food and beverage and offered increased points of sale. The strength of our business is continuing into 2018 with confirmed arena, amphitheater and stadium shows through February 19 up 7% compared to this time last year. Overall, we expect a very strong year across our amphitheaters, arenas and festivals with some decline in stadiums on a year-over-year basis. Given our plans to further monetize our fan relationships, I expect this will translate into a continued strong growth in concerts AOI in 2018. In our sponsorship division, we grew our high-margin business 18% and AOI 13% in 2017. Throughout 2017 our top strategic sponsors have been a key driver of our growth, as our 50-plus sponsors that spend over $1 million per year, collectively spent $285 million to reach our fans, up 19% from last year. Sponsorship at our festivals grew 20%, this growth was driven by our new deals with brands including American Express, American Eagle, Samsung and Amazon Web Services. All this reinforces the power of our platform of 86 million fans, and the continued shift by brands to invest in the live experience. Our research indicates that 90% of brands think that Live Nation can help them reach millennials, and almost 70% of fans say they are more likely to be receptive to brand messaging at concerts. With over 70% of budgeted sponsorship revenue for the year already committed, we are confident we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for this year. Ticketmaster continued growing its leadership in ticketing in 2017, with GTV up 15% and total platform GTV of $30 billion, delivering 500 million tickets to fans in 29 countries. This drove our 17% increase in ticketing revenue and AOI growth of 12%. The Ticketmaster platform continues to demonstrate its effectiveness in selling tickets to fans, with the fourth quarter being our top quarter ever, selling over 50 million fee-bearing tickets which delivered over $4 billion in GTV. Our number one priority at Ticketmaster in 2017 was building products to better serve the artist community. Music accounts for 80% of Ticketmaster's GTV growth in recent years, making it imperative for us to extend our focus from venues to those artists who are filling the venues. First among those product successes last year was Verified Fan, a key step in giving artists greater control of how their tickets are sold. Through the year, we worked with over 80 artists on Verified Fan, selling 3 million tickets and saving fans over $100 million relative to what they would have spent on the secondary market to buy these tickets. As we look to 2018, it will continue to be a top priority to evolve Verified Fan, while also building out a full suite of services that continue to give artists greater control of how their tickets are priced and distributed. At the same time, we've also continued to improve our marketplace, already by far the largest ticketing marketplace in the world. We remain focused on building the inventory available to fans, adding new clients and expanding our secondary listings. Adding third-party events enabled Ticketmaster in North America to increase by over 25% the number of events for which it sold in 2017, and further reinforced our marketplace as a one-stop solution for fans needing tickets. Ticketmaster continues to have success in 2018 as ticket sales are up 5% through February 19, positioning us for another year of growth. In 2017, we again delivered strong growth through our flywheel strategy, growing our global concerts business, and thereby driving growth in our high margin on-site, sponsorship and ticketing businesses. This strategy has consistently delivered for several years now, creating shareholder value through double-digit AOI and free cash flow growth. We believe that the combination of macro trends and our demonstrated ability to execute provide great confidence in our ability to grow the business for many years to come. In 2018, I expect us to further consolidate our global concerts position while enhancing our on-site hospitality business and capturing additional pricing opportunities. On sponsorship business, we will continue driving double-digit growth with more brands looking for that direct connection with music fans, and a more effective Ticketmaster marketplace along with further alignment with artists should continue to build on Ticketmaster's success. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe, to take you through additional details on our fourth quarter, and divisional performance. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first concerts. As Michael said in 2017, we grew attendance by 21% to a record 86 million fans, once again promoting the vast majority of the top global tours, including six artists who each sold over a 1 million tickets for concerts during the year. Looking at the markets, the North America attendance was up 13% over 54 million fans and show count was up 14%. Internationally, attendance was up 39% and show count is up 11%. Attendance was up across most of our venue types with arenas, stadiums and theaters, and clubs, each growing attendance by over 4 million fans for the year, and with each of these venue type increasing both show count and attendance per show. Only amphitheater attendance, coming off a record 2016 was off slightly as we saw several acts playing stadiums or indoors, last year. Globally, we also continued growing our festival portfolio, adding 12 festivals to give us a global portfolio of 97 festivals in 14 countries. As a result, we increased festival attendance by 14% to over 8 million fans and now have 27 festivals that each attracted over 100,000 fans last year. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, concerts revenue was up 53%, while AOI was down $12 million, largely due to timing of prepaid marketing spend, which was up $16 million year-on-year. As Michael said, we're optimistic that we will continue growing concerts AOI in 2018, we already have five artists who have sold over 500,000 tickets for shows this year, and show count is looking strong for the amphitheaters and arenas. Plans are also in place for continued growth of on-site spending which we expect to grow another $2 per fan in 2018. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business, in 2017, our international business, particularly Germany and across Asia, was a large driver of our sponsorship growth, with revenue up 30%, while North America grew 13%. Both sponsorship and online advertising contributed consistently with revenue of 19% and 16% respectively. For the fourth quarter, revenue was up 11% and AOI was up 7%, as we comped against a 2016 fourth quarter that had revenue growth of 22%. Finally, Ticketmaster, global GTV was up 6% for both the quarter and year-to-date driven by GTV, which was up 17% and 15% for the quarter and year respectively. Primary GTV which accounts for over 85% of overall fee-bearing in GTV was up 17% for the quarter and 15% for the full year. Secondary GTV was up 18% for the quarter and up 16% for the full year. We continued our shift to mobile ticketing over the year with mobile ticket sales up 35% accounting for 33% of our ticket sales in 2017, and we also grow our app installed by 37% to 43 million. At the same time, we improved conversion rates across our platforms, up double digits on both mobile and desktop for both primary and secondary tickets. And on margins, as we expected on the last call, adjusted for our legal settlement and legal fees associated with the lawsuit, our AOI margin for the year would have been in the 20% range consistent with 2016. As Michael mentioned, ticket sales through February 2019 were up 5% and we expect Ticketmaster to be deliver mid-single digit ticket growth for the full year. In summary, 2017 was a great year across all our businesses and we expect 2018 to continue the trend. From a phasing standpoint, we expect the majority of our growth to come in Q2 and Q3, particularly as we deliver on our on-site fan spending and sponsorship initiatives. As a result, Q1 AOI looks to be largely in line with 2017 results. On FX, we ended up with a 1% or less impact on AOI and revenue for 2017. And at this point, we don't see more than a 1% to 2 % impact for 2018. I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with our results for the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 42% to $2.5 billion. Concerts contributed the majority of the revenue growth, up 53% with increased arena and stadium activity. Ticketing revenue was up 21% from higher primary and secondary ticket sales. As we had previously announced, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we accrued a $110 million legal settlement in our ticketing segment that reduced our operating income, AOI and net income for the fourth quarter and full year. This resulted in a consolidated AOI loss of $23 million for the quarter, compared to what would have been income of $87 million without the legal settlement. Our operating loss of $202 million in the fourth quarter largely driven by the legal settlement along with a $20 million goodwill impairment in concerts related to our artists services business. Net loss for the quarter was $191 million. The legal settlement and goodwill impairment were the primary drivers of this reduction. However, results were positively impacted by a $56 million income tax benefit, related to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recent U.S. tax reform. Moving on to our 2017 full-year results. Revenue was $10.3 billion, a 24% increase over 2016. All of our segments, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing delivered double-digit revenue growth in 2017. The majority of our revenue increase was driven by concerts, up 26% from increased show count and attendance globally across arenas, stadiums and theaters and clubs. Ticketing revenue was up 17% from higher global primary ticket volume driven by concerts, and sponsorship and advertising revenue was at 18% from new sponsorship programs and higher online advertising. AOI was $625 million for the 2017 full-year or $735 million without the legal settlement impact. AOI in 2016 was $640 million. Our growth excluding the legal settlement was again across all segments. Concerts AOI was up 24% as a result of increased show count and attendance along with higher ancillary revenue per-fan at our amphitheaters. Sponsorship and advertising AOI grew by 13%, driven by higher sponsorship and online activity. And our ticketing segment grew excluding the litigation settlement from higher primary and secondary sales. Operating income was $91 million, down from the $195 million we reported last year, again driven by the legal settlement and goodwill impairment in 2017. And our net loss for full-year 2017 was $6 million, down $9 million compared to last year. For the full year, we recorded $92 million of accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest from certain acquisition-related put arrangements that impacts the calculation of earnings per share. This amount increased for the projection of third quarter due to finalization of the value of certain puts that were exercised in the quarter. We currently expect accretion of approximately $75 million in total for 2018 based on our current holdings, which will be fairly consistently spread across quarters. Amortization of non-repeatable ticketing contract advances for 2017 was $85 million compared to $86 million in 2016, including the impact of purchase accounting. We currently expect 2018 to be in line with this. Beginning in 2018, as a result of FASB's new standard on revenue recognition, we will now recognize clients' royalties and non-recoupable advances as a reduction to revenue in our ticketing segment, while the remaining revenue streams of the company will not be impacted. We will also have no change in the timing of when we recognize revenue. When we report 2018, we will apply this change to all periods presented for comparability. Overall, the impact of 2017 is a reduction of our total revenue of 6%. It will be no impact to our AOIs or operating incomes as a result of these changes. Full details of the impact to 2017 and 2016 can be found in Note 1 of our 2017 10-K. Turning to our balance sheet, as of December 31, we had total cash of $1.8 billion, including $769 million in ticketing client cash and $608 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $448 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $623 million in 2017, up from $597 million last year due to increased working capital. Free cash flow adjusted was $334 million or 53% of AOIs compared to $368 million or 58% of AOI in 2016. This metric is also impacted by the legal settlement and 2017 would have been $444 million or 60% without that. For the full year, total capital expenditures were $227 million, evenly split between maintenance and revenue generating items. The increase this year was primarily due to technology enhancements in venue and festival improvements. For 2018, we currently expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million, with about half of this on revenue generating expenditures. Our total net debt as of December 2017 was $2.3 billion with a weighted average cost of 3.9%. And finally, as we look forward to 2018, our deferred revenue for future shows, a key leading indicator for concerts was $816 million at the end of 2017, up 13% compared to the $722 million at the same point last year. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Brandon Ross with BTIG. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : (20:24) Ticketmaster. One, there's a story out there this afternoon that the Cowboys will take a 15% stake in SeatGeek and opt out of the NFL Ticketmaster deal. I guess SeatGeek also took venues in New Orleans. How do you size them up as a competitive threat there? Then on 2017, just trying to get a sense of what the organic growth would have been had you not had the legal fees associated with the Songkick Settlement. Calculating that it's about 17%, is that accurate? And then finally you've spoken a lot about Verified Fan and raising ticket prices, and we've seen that this summer with a little bit of push back from the fan communities, but how do you see that impacting your financials for the year, specifically those objectives? Thanks. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hey, Brandon, it's Joe, I'll take the first two and Michael can take the last one. On the Cowboys, I saw the same article as you did. I guess first of all just looking at the NFL broadly, I think we feel very good about our position with the NFL and the teams, as you know, they're working with us to launch digital ticketing for the first time, any league on a very broad basis. So, we think they're a great partner with that. We're aligned with them on the secondary as their official marketplace, we get all the links from their websites, we get all the season ticketholder inventory posted to our secondary. And then by competing with SeatGeek and others, we think will end up with the vast, vast majority of all of the teams doing their primary ticketing with us. I think, hard to comment on a specific thing, but what I will say is that, what matters to us most in general is what's the business model and what's the scalability of the business model. We spend a lot of time working on how do we make sure we have a very competitive business model, talk a lot about our flywheel and the different pieces of the business model, and as we go into every negotiation, we ask how do we make money? How do we scale this business? And how do we see the overall flywheel for growth? So, when I hear stories as you did about competitors giving substantial portions of their equity to get a contract, to us that would generally imply that it's not very scalable, which gives us more comfort with it. And frankly also sends a message out in the marketplace, I assume if you're the next guy talking to them, you're asking where your big chunk of equity is. So, if anything I think it seems that it makes it harder for them to scale if those reports are true. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Organic growth? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: On the organic growth point, we haven't broken it out exactly, but yes, if you back out the Songkick, generally what we've seen in the past is, is that of our total growth, 75% to 80% of its organic, as you know we're acquisitive with a lot of little tuck-in acquisitions, but 75% to 80% of the growth that you see would be organic. So, it would be in the back out Songkick in the low teens AOI organic growth. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Okay. And then just on Verified Fan? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, it's Michael, Brandon, Verified Fan, we're thrilled with our launch. It's a new idea for artists, we're happy in 2017, we had some of the biggest in the world from Springsteen to Taylor, U2 adopt the idea of trying to lock down your ticket directly to your fan at the price you wanted. So, we saw a great success in getting fans, the ticket direct at the price, always still going to be secondary tickets, that wasn't the main goal. Main goal was, can we convince artists that if they start pricing the house right, increasing their P1s, we can then also look at how we can deliver those P1s directly to the fan. And over time, we believe through digital ticketing and technology, the artist and Ticketmaster will continue to be able to deliver tickets directly to registered fans at prices artists believe and agree on, and for us that's the way we make the pie the biggest for both of us. So, we had a lot of artists on Verified Fan and we expect it to grow this year in 2018. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you and good afternoon. Maybe just following up on the ticketing side, but on the other hand, if you can, Michael I guess or Joe if you could comment on Amazon's restructuring I guess in the U.S. and UK, and perhaps what this actually might mean for you in terms of market share on the secondary side, that would be great? And then just a point of clarification, for your ticketing guidance, when you talked about mid-single digit growth, are you referring to revenue or AOI? And what sort of growth assumptions should we be making? Thank you. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. Amy, this is Joe. On Amazon, frankly we see the same things that you do that they have decided to pull back in the UK and the U.S. for now. I don't know that it was ever as much about secondary. So, we don't see a big share shift there. Most of the foray that they had in the UK seem to be primary related. They're obviously a competitor or player out there that we respect a huge amount and we'll see how it plays out. I think they learned some of the complexities of the business and hard to say what happens next with them. In terms of the ticket guidance, that was about ticket count. So, I don't think we were guiding exactly the revenue and the other pieces yet as you know and Kathy mentioned that will go through revenue recognition changes. So, I think it's a bit premature to get into the revenue side of it. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it, okay. That's helpful. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Janedis with Jefferies. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Hi, thank you. Two questions for me. One is, in the past you've talked about improving sellout, and I guess in theory the more shows you promote, the harder it is to improve that metric. So, can you talk about what you're seeing from a sellout perspective and to what extent are you seeing incremental success from improvements in data and technology? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. No problem. So, I wouldn't, John, say so much improved sellouts has reduced the number of unsold tickets for any given show, meaning upon average shows that 25%, 30% of the tickets not sold out, it's every 3 point or 4 point reduction in that, that we can get. That's a big benefit to the artists, big benefit to our overall flywheel strategy. So, we are absolutely seeing continued improvement, we look at it as is, our job is to make sure we're filling the shelves, we're getting people to show up and we're getting people when they show up to convert. So as we talk about all of the elements, each of those improved substantially through 2017 and data was absolutely a big part of it, as we get better and better at targeting with our marketing, targeting better with our search optimization, as well as improving the experience in driving conversion when you are at the mobile sites or on that desktop. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks, Joe. Maybe separately, just on festivals, can you talk about the incremental increase you're expecting this year that I guess with the scalability on the sponsorship side, are new festivals more profitable than they have been in the past? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: It's Michael. It's a pretty broad statement as you know, we have over 90 festivals in varying degrees of sizes and scales and some of them are start-ups and some of them are Lollapaloozas and established, so there is no kind of simple way of looking at, are they growing or more profitable, we look at the ones that either are existing in the main markets we have, we look to build on those and the big ones that you know about the Lollapaloozas, et cetera, are doing fabulous. And then we have a whole host of either start-up or middle ones that we are in the process of growing and maximizing like BottleRock's. So we look at a very portfolio and a market approach to festivals. We'd like to have kind of covered in all areas from start-ups to established with different growth rates. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. You mentioned amp attendance was down slightly in 2017, is there anything to indicate this might be a longer term change or is this mostly just a function of tough comp and the mix of touring acts? And then just as a follow-up, you guided to another $2 per fan growth in on-site spend, can you just discuss some of the drivers of that growth for 2018 relative to last year? Thanks. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. The amps we're seeing no trend that's relevant in 2017. If we look at 2018, we think we're going to have an increase in 2018 over 2017 and have a strong year in amps. So, we don't look at anything that would worry us, if anything the trend in amps over the last five years has been on the upswing, we're very, very bullish on the amps as a business, we continue to look to expand the amps, acquire new ones, build new ones, invest in them, they're a incredible piece of business line, and we're very bullish on them and we think 2018 will be a great year. As far as on-site spending? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. On-site spending, again, we're going to continue to do a lot of what we've been doing, continuing to get more and more granular, which unlocks the next round of sales, so it's continuing to add more points of sale, limiting those volumes for particularly in the middle of the show when you have the intermission, it's focusing on making sure you've got the right product mix at each one of those points of sale, optimizing pricing against your competitive environment, and what you see a price elasticity of demand is, and then it's also continuing to roll out at a bit higher scale, some of our on-site experiences and VIP offerings. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. So, Kathy was kind enough to call out the growth and the deferred revenue side. I don't want to suggest this is a near-term risk, but maybe, if you can talk about the longer term nature of this threat. As I look at the Spotify numbers and Apple in terms of these interactive streaming subscriptions that consumers are lapping up. It seems to be going a long way towards supplanting sort of the demise of physical music sales. Do you get nervous at all about that ultimately crimping the supply side of your business model, meaning the artists just have other ways to make money by just getting a royalty check or a check from their record label as opposed to going on the road and tour? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hey, Jason, our deferred, Joe will explain you, you have it backwards, it's a good day when our deferred is up. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: No, no. What I'm saying is, the deferred means nothing is eminent, but I'm wondering if you step back, how do we sort of square this growth with these services with the supply side of your business model? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Okay. But just \u2013 again to set the facts straight, deferred revenue was up which mean we sold more tickets for shows in 2017 for 2018 shows than we sold in 2016 for 2017 shows. So that would be one of our key leading indicators that we were going to have another year of growth in 2018, I just make sure we got that straight for everybody. But to your point on the ticket supply, the supply, your correlation again would be I think, we would look at it quite differently, I think history says that the artist was very reliant on record deals with $50 million, $60 million, $70 million record deals in the old days. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So for many, many years you toured to sell records and records was a high piece of what a superstar income was derived. Over the last 10 years that's dramatically declined obviously and today we're streaming even more successful artist like Drake who maybe the most Spotify-ed streamed artist in the world, is going to make 95% of the money, his income on the road. So, at the end of the day the artists, we're thrilled that streaming is exploding, the more artists -the more consumers around the world that continue to consume music and find out about superstars and discover music is great for us, and the best part is the artist ultimately still looks the road as the ultimate way that he is going to drive most of his income on an annual basis to build his audience and connect with his fans. So, we think it's a great correlation that the business is healthy and the artist has great pipes distribution to spread his art, but ultimately we believe that the trend will continue where being on the road it is very important to his economics. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. So the more Spotify grows, the better it is for you, so you'll (34:36)? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Absolutely. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Tinker with Gabelli. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Hi. Thank you. In terms of breaking out your ticketing, and so about 15% of this is from secondary. What would you estimate your share now do you think is in that market? And that this implies that I think you probably have about 300 million, StubHub reports about $1 billion? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, it sounds like you've done the math, John? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's for the quarter John, is that your estimates, because I think we talked last year already, we were over $1 billion in GTV, so this year we'd be well over that. I think at this point we're in \u2013 somewhere in the 20%s, but as we talk now for some time we're not \u2013 we're more obsessed with the Verified Fan and the pricing and really bringing the value on to the primary than we are at the exactness of a secondary share, we want to make sure we've got great product for the consumer, which we have we believe with our integrated inventory. We want to make sure we've got a very effective technology and product for artists and for teams. And we think that over time that helps create the most effective and successful marketplace. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: And more of a generic question to Michael, congratulations on your joining the board of Sirius, who with Liberty Sirius of just now trying to basically buy 40% of iHeart in bankruptcy. How do you see Live Nation, is there any involvement with the radio business in anyways, it's that something you spend a lot of money advertising on or is it just another small part of your ecosystem? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: You're good, John. You love to tie these together, but I can't give you much on it. Sirius is an interesting board, it was something for me to experience given the Liberty family, but other than it's in the Liberty family it's continually business as usual. On our side, we look at Spotify, and Sirius, and Apple, and all of those platforms as ongoing promotion tools, that we'll use in our business. But today it was just day a Michael Rapino decision to be on the Sirius board to get a little bit of an exposure to a new business model, nothing else to read into it. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: And how much money does Live spend on advertising on the radio side, or is it really just not that important now? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, it's not that important. We don't \u2013 we've been spending most of our as we said out loud for the last few years, our conversion in selling more tickets to the concerts has been about direct marketing and online. So we've shifted over the last few years most of our kind of traditional advertising to more online mobile advertising, which has been effective. Not to say iHeartRadio and radio stations around the world aren't still important to the artists especially when they're on cycle and launching a new album or single. So we do spend some money on radio still and it's one piece of the pie, but we shifted most \u2013 a majority of our advertising for concerts now is more online and direct. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Joyce with Evercore. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. Two questions please. First is on the ancillary on-site spend, guiding to another $2 increase. How much of your platform currently can use these new initiatives that you've been working on delivering to the seat in the extra kiosks and what have you. I'm just wondering how much more of a rollout you're going to be looking for, and I know you've talked about getting that figure up to about $30 in time? And then secondly on sponsorship and advertising, I was just wondering with the couple of the marketers that you called out, are they incremental to your sponsorship universe or they've been adding to current contracts, and what's going to be \u2013 how do we parse out the growth going forward? Thank you. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. David, this is Joe. I'll take both of these, on the ancillary spend I think you got it right at the end, which is we continue to believe that we get to $30, and that's just the first target we have and then we reassess and go from there. Every year we've got a wide range of initiatives that we're testing in a handful of amps. We've rolled out to a broader set of amps and we have every amp running with, and then we'll do the same this year. So, we'll take some of the stuff that was successful last year and we'll expand it, and we'll be trying some new things this year. But everything that we've seen has shown that we continue to track right where we thought we would be in terms of adding a couple dollars a year and continuing to chug towards that initial target. On the sponsorship and advertising, the brands that we called out are a mix, some of them have been working with us for a while, and are adding new ways that they want to try to reach some of our fans and some of them are new. We've focused you I think on a couple of areas : One is looking for a major sponsors, what's the continued rate of growth of those sponsors, which was way about 20% last year; and then the other is looking at some of our more direct on-site spend and how much does that continue to grow. So, I think those will continue to be the couple of things that we focus you on. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : And I apologize if I missed it, but do have a domestic versus international split for both sponsorship and advertising contribution in 2017? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So I think yeah in my comments what we said is, is that international revenue was up 30% driven by Germany in particular and across Asia for the business and North America grew 13%, and that's both sponsorship and online were up pretty consistently with revenue up 19% in sponsorship and 16% online. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks. Kathy, a simple question here. In ticketing you \u2013 in the fourth quarter you basically reported a breakeven AOI, so the entire charge was in there, so if you back the charge out, is it fair to say that the adjusted AOI would have been $109.8 million, is that fair, without the charge? Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, that's right. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. So that's actually a pretty strong quarter for ticketing? Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Correct. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : On the bottom line and top line. And then secondly, I mean, Joe you cited the pre-marketing expenses of $16 million in the quarter. I know seasonally the fourth quarter is never a great bottom line in the concert business, but I mean you added a hell of a lot of revenues in the quarter and don't have much to show for it on the bottom line. Is there something other? Is it just a mix of shows or the expense of the tours that you were out there? I mean, I'm trying to understand the disconnect there. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, and again what I gave you on the marketing was just the incremental year-on-year. So yes, every year is a lot that was just happened to be a big growth Q4 for the marketing that as you know we have to expense. I think the other is just as we continue to get bigger and bigger, right, we're at 86 million fans, 30,000 shows, it was only a few years ago that we were at 50 million fans. So we have grown very rapidly, tremendously. A lot of that growth if you look at it, I think continues to be very Q3, Q4 driven. So that does \u2013 as your organization grows, that does put a bit of a cost burden on your slower volume quarters, in your first, in your four, in terms of just their ability to drive revenue relative to their costs, that then disproportionately comes in more in Q2 and Q3. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So last call I guess it sounded like to me that the move to digital with NFL was kind of step one, then the hope was that you could get a broader roll out to kind of other major stadiums and arenas in 2018 and 2019. But just kind of hoping to kind of get a refresh on that view, how has the rollout gone so far, and maybe some thoughts or expectations around how many tickets or percentage of tickets you think will be sold digitally this year? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, this is Joe. I don't think we've gone out with any specific numbers. So we're probably not going to do that right now. But we'll start to deploy the digital ticketing at our amps this summer and that will be the first real use of them that will go into some of the NFL in the fall, and then really get broader and expand from there in 2019. So, you'll start to see again I think us doing it with ourselves first and then it will be expanding at the NFL level, and then at other specific team levels in other arenas. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. And then I guess just following up on the question on SeatGeek, I guess we heard a bit for the New Orleans teams maybe actually come in at a loss there. And while I guess they might make money on the Cowboys deal, I guess like you said it's a tough business giving away equity if that's the cost. So, I guess I understand your comments on scalability, but in the near term does this put pressure on Ticketmaster margins or do you think you partners kind of realize that maybe these terms aren't sustainable longer term? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes, it's Michael, we've never had a 100% of the NFL team. So, historically, there's always competitors that are TicketsNow and Axxess and other guys who've been at the table when these teams are up. So, SeatGeek's the latest we expected that as others. We knew that when we secure the overall relationship with the NFL that the competitors would then use those funds they didn't use to win kind of the national deal to go local, that's the usual model. We believe in the end, we're going to continue having close to the 31 teams, we'll lose two or three as we historically have done. And we expected SeatGeek or our competitors to be there at the table with the teams as they're up. We've renewed what we needed to renew in 2017 and we're on course on 2018 for renewal. So, I just would say not trying to discredit or competitors, they're always there, they've always been there, there's always a competitor at a sports teams door looking to challenge, and we don't see that any different this year than we have historically. And a competitor like SeatGeek is probably going to overpay, take some lost leaders to build their business. We just again, I think, Joe's point was, we look to both the New Orleans deal and the Cowboys deal, we know exactly what they were offered. You wouldn't want us to win that deal. We don't believe that it's a sustainable model, what that they can offer that to 30 teams, you only have so many pieces of equity. So, we expected them to be strong on a couple of teams or three, and we expect to win the majority as we have in business as usual. We're very, very happy about our overall NFL deal, because we redefine that deal to be much more in our favor going forward on how we can actually drive our secondary business. So, overall we're thrilled with the overall relationship of the NFL economics for Ticketmaster both the league and the teams and didn't see anything new that we don't see or haven't seen historically with the competitive bidding process of the ticketiness.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter 2018 conference call. 2018 is off to a great start, even better than I expected when we had our February call. The first quarter outperformed our projections as we delivered 19% revenue, 24% AOI, and 76% free cash flow growth, all of our divisions delivering double-digit AOI growth. Even more importantly, we now have booked enough concerts, sold enough tickets, had enough advertising commitments to be confident that we will have a successful 2018, delivering double-digit AOI growth for the year. We continue to benefit from a global concerts industry that is structurally growing with strong tailwinds for both supply and demand. Starting with the Concerts business, revenue was up 20%, and AOI improved by 29% as we promoted 22% more shows for 15% more fans globally in the first quarter. Looking toward the full year, through April, we have booked 5,000 arena, stadium and amphitheater shows, up 21% over this point last year. This growth is led by our amphitheaters, with show count up 27% to over 2,000 shows, growth that we will now further monetize through on-site fan spending. At this point, I have even stronger expectations for growth on-site spending at our amphitheaters. Across a number of initiatives we are executing this year, enhancing our VIP offering, adding points of sale and improving product selection, I now expect our average spend per fan to grow by at least $2.50 through the summer. We also continue to capture more value for the artists and Live Nation through pricing optimization, delivering more of the market value to the artists. As a result, average ticket pricing is up double digits across each amphitheater, arena and stadium tickets sold so far this year. And while North America is having a strong summer, we continue to see strong performance across the 40 countries we promote shows around the world, with tickets sold for international arena shows and festivals up double digits through April. I'm particularly encouraged by our progress in Latin America with tickets sold for shows in the region more than tripling so far this year. And our recently announced acquisition of Rock in Rio will provide us a strong foundation for future growth in Latin America. With our global concerts business looking strong again this year, the Concerts segment continues to be the engine that powers the Live Nation flywheel strategy, growing the profitability of the Concerts business while also driving our sponsorship and ticketing businesses. Our Sponsorship business continues to demonstrate the value of directly connecting with 90 million fans at our concert this year with revenue and AOI both up 17% for the quarter. Through April, we are pacing double digits ahead of last year in committed revenue, and have over 80% of our planned revenue for the year committed. I again expect our growth to be driven by our festivals and large strategic sponsors, and we continue adding a number of these new partners, including Frito Lay, Proctor & Gamble and Twitter. As a result, I expect we'll deliver double-digit AOI growth in Sponsorship again this year. Ticketmaster had a very strong start to the year as well, growing revenue 19% and AOI by 17% for the quarter, as it had its largest quarter in history, transacting almost 60 million tickets for 21% growth in global GTV to $5 billion. At its core, Ticketmaster continues to be the most effective ticketing platform in the world, with the technology to serve venues, sports teams and artists, and with the marketplace to attract and convert ticket buyers. Demonstrating our success, we signed 135 additional clients in the quarter, adding new clients across 19 countries. Our strategic partnership with the NFL is off to a strong start, with substantial increases in both primary and secondary ticket sales in the few weeks since the schedules were released. And as our pioneer client for digital ticketing, the NFL has eliminated ticket PDFs for next season, positioning teams to identify a much higher portion of fans attending their games. Verified Fan, our artist program to help ensure tickets are sold to fans at the onsale, also continues to grow with major onsales including Pearl Jam, Elton John, Thirty Seconds to Mars and 5 Seconds of Summer rolling out campaigns in the first quarter. And we continue investing in new technology to further differentiate Ticketmaster from others in the ticketing business. Today we announced our partnership with, and investment in, Blink Identity which has cutting-edge facial recognition technology, enabling you to associate your digital ticket with your image, and walk into the show. In addition to building technologies to better serve our venues, sports teams and artists, we continue investing to make Ticketmaster an even better marketplace for fans to buy tickets. To start, we have increased the number of events listed on Ticketmaster, up 16% for the quarter to over 195,000 events. And along with this, we increased site visits by 9% while lowering our paid cost of acquisition by 20% through continuing marketing improvements. Once we have customers visit our site, we further improve our conversion, particularly on mobile. Following a redesigned purchase experience on mobile that we rolled out last year, mobile ticket sales are up 36% for the quarter, now accounting for almost 40% of all ticket sales, with conversion rates improving by over 20%. With this strong start to the year, we expect another record year in ticketing. 2018 is on track to deliver double-digit AOI growth along with strong gains in revenue and free cash flow. Our key leading indicators for our Concerts, Sponsorship and Ticketing are ahead of last year, and we expect each of our businesses to deliver record revenue and AOI this year. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details on our performance this quarter. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, Concerts. In the first quarter, Live Nation promoted 7,000 concerts for 12.5 million fans worldwide, increases of 22% and 15%, respectively. Show count growth exceeded fan growth because much of our show count increase came from club shows in the quarter which have a lower number of fans per concert. Both North America and international markets had strong fan growth at 18% and 11%, respectively. And for the full year through April 30, we've sold over 50 million tickets for shows this year, up 5% from last year and putting us on pace for about 90 million fans this year. This growth is largely being driven by North America so far with 34% growth in amphitheater ticket sales and 4% growth in arena ticket sales. Internationally, we have seen similarly strong growth in arena ticket sales, up 15%, with the expected decline in stadium shows. Globally, our festival business continues to expand as well with ticket sales for festivals up 17% year-on-year, heading forward where we expect to be almost 9 million fans this year. Overall, we continue to believe that 2018 will be another strong year for our Concerts business, growing our fan base by mid-single digits, further optimizing pricing, and capturing higher average spend per fan at our amphitheaters. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business, AOI was up 17% for the quarter with North America up 13% and international up 21%. The majority of our growth came from the online portion of our business, up 25% for the quarter, driven by an increase of new advertisers across our digital network globally combined with growth in programmatic ad sales and continued strong interest in our new digital and content products. Given that over 85% of our advertising AOI is typically recognized from the second through fourth quarters, at this time of the year, our committed sales pipeline is our key leading indicator. And with over 80% of our target sponsorship committed, we're tracking to deliver double-digit AOI growth again this year. Finally, Ticketmaster's global GTV in the first quarter was $8.2 billion, up 12% year-on-year. Of this, our fee-bearing GTV was $4.5 billion, up 22% with ticket volume up 7%. Within this, primary GTV was up 22% while secondary GTV was up 28%. North America and international markets were similarly strong, up 23% and 21%, respectively. Concerts activity continues to be the primary driver for GTV growth for Ticketmaster with over 80% of primary GTV growth coming from concerts along with a substantial portion of our secondary growth. Overall, we were very pleased with our first quarter in Ticketing and how it sets us up for the full year. We saw continued strong consumer demand from most tours, also benefiting from some onsales that we were expecting in the second quarter moving into the first quarter. And as a result, we continue to expect mid-single digit growth in ticket sales for the year, generating double-digit growth in fee-bearing GTV. In summary, four months into the year, given the strength of all of our leading indicators, we're confident that we will deliver double-digit AOI growth in 2018. Our flywheel model is working. Our first quarter results were substantially driven by our Ticketing business, notably from selling more concert tickets. We will see these concerts play out throughout the year, driving our high-margin, on-site and sponsorship businesses. On a few specifics, we currently expect year-on-year percentage AOI growth to be fairly consistent across the remaining three quarters. And on FX, we had a 2% to 3% positive impact on the business in Q1, and based on rates today expect Q2 to be about the same. Before handing the call over to Kathy, let me step back and make a few comments about a recent New York Times article and some allegations it made. First, as it relates to the consent decree, we do not believe that over the past eight years, with almost 200,000 shows and thousands of Ticketmaster renewals, that we've made a practice of violating the consent decree. Unfortunately, our competitor, AEG, has chosen to complain to the DoJ whenever they lose to us, which has been often. And when they didn't get what they wanted out of the DoJ, they complained to The New York Times. That's the genesis of this. After AEG complained to the DoJ, we took a hard look at over 30 venues and produced information about our dealings with those venues. The DoJ then raised concerns about 3 of them, 3 out of over 2,000 venue clients in North America. We don't believe there were decree violations with respect to those three, but given the thousands of Ticketmaster venue relationships, this clearly shows we have no systemic issues. Second, it's important to emphasize that under the decree, we are allowed to bundle ticketing and content, and we are allowed to talk subjectively about how ticketing may affect concert routing. We are not allowed to force Ticketmaster on venues, nor are we allowed to retaliate against venues that choose other ticketing providers. And by policy and practice, we don't do either. We take our obligations to comply with the consent decree very seriously, and we broadly agree with the DoJ on what we can and cannot do. And since the beginning of the consent decree, we have had in place ongoing training and controls to ensure that we have the highest possible adherence to the decree. So we just don't believe we've intentionally violated the consent decree. Any possible disagreement with the DoJ is very much on the margin, generally having to deal with comments made by few local promoters over the years and how those comments can be misconstrued. This is not a case where the DoJ is fundamentally questioning our flywheel business model, nor thinks there is anything structurally unlawful about it. So, as a result, we don't see these issues leading to any fundamental changes in our business practices nor any material costs to the company. And I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. As I mentioned on the last call, beginning with this reporting period, we are now reporting royalties and nonrecoupable advances paid to our ticketing clients as a reduction to revenue in our Ticketing segment. This change has no impact to our AOI or operating income. We have adjusted the 2017 financial statements in this 10-Q to reflect this new reporting for comparability. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2018, our revenue was up 19% to $1.5 billion. AOI increased 24% to $114 million. Free cash flow adjusted was $46 million, up $20 million from the first quarter of 2017. And as of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.8 billion, up 12% over the March of last year. The increase in revenue was driven by all segments with each delivering double-digit growth. The majority of this growth came from Concerts, up 20% with increased activity in arenas globally and North American theaters and clubs. Ticketing revenue was up 19% from higher primary and resale volumes, both driven by concerts as Joe noted. Our AOI growth of 24% for the first quarter was again driven by all three segments delivering double-digit growth. Strong growth in sales volume at Ticketmaster contributed most of the increase. Our operating loss was $6 million in the first quarter, an improvement of $15 million or 72% over last year, driven by the strong operating performance across all our business segments. And net loss for the quarter was $34 million, in line with last year with the increase in interest expense and debt extinguishment losses totaling $7 million primarily related to our March debt refinancing. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $16 million. For the full year, we currently estimate that this accretion will be approximately $70 million with the remainder for the year fairly consistent across the quarters. Turning to our balance sheet. In March, we issued $300 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2026, $550 million of 2.5% convertible senior notes due 2023, and amended our senior secured credit facility to reduce the interest rate for our term loan B. The proceeds were used to repay the majority of the outstanding convertible senior notes due 2019 and the related repurchase premium and fees, leaving $524 million available to repurchase the remaining balance of the convertible notes due 2019 and for investment in the business. As a result, we recorded $3 million of debt extinguishment loss in the first quarter and we expect total interest expense for the full year to be approximately $140 million with growth evenly across the remaining quarters of 2018. As of March 31, we had total cash of $2.9 billion including $888 million in client cash and $1.3 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $718 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $775 million, up $14 million over the first quarter of 2017 primarily from our higher deferred revenue. Free cash flow adjusted was $46 million, up $20 million from the first quarter of last year. Our total capital expenditures for the quarter were $37 million with 52% spent on revenue-generating items. We currently expect our capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $250 million with approximately half on revenue-generating CapEx. Our total net debt as of March 31 was $2.9 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.1%. For the full year 2018, based on our current estimates, corporate AOI will be in line with last year with Q2 cost increasing over prior year by approximately 10%. And non-cash compensation will also be about the same as last year and fairly consistent across the quarter. For the second quarter of 2018, we currently expect that acquisition expenses will be about $10 million, which includes the estimated costs for Rock in Rio along with other transactions. And the impact of all net expenses below operating income will be approximately 25% of AOI for Q2. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks and good afternoon. So first, on Verified Fan, maybe there's a little bit of controversy out there with the Taylor Swift concert. What are you learning and how many fans do you have right now? Anything you could share with us would be really great. And I know \u2013 my second question is actually on concert mix. I know that margins are not a really big focus for you. But obviously given the mix of amphitheaters and the onsite revenue bogey that you laid out, should we be expecting that margins this year will improve relative to last year? Thank you. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Amy. It's Michael. I'll take Verified Fan. We had a very successful launch last year in terms of distribution and getting it across a ton of tours and kind of pursuing our goal of, can we identify fans in advance and then make sure that we can deliver that ticket to that fan at the price the artist wanted. 2017, we learned a lot. I would say that what we learned is the reality of Verified Fan is as long as we do it in advance and we get registered fans and then we have inventory to match, it works seamlessly. Where we learned some lessons is when we over-verified and didn't have enough inventory, i.e., you got verified but we still didn't have enough tickets \u2013 not a good experience for the fan \u2013 or when we did verify fan at onsale, and put too much pressure at one's time. So, overall, we've learned through the execution that when we register the fan in advance of the onsale, get that database done, correlate that, flush out any of the bad bots, we can identify fans directly and sell them. We wouldn't see any correlation on the controversy of Taylor Swift Verified Fan reducing sales. That wouldn't be the reason sales are strong or soft for an artist. Verified Fan is kind of a separate strategy, just a separate profiling to get fans the direct price. We've got a bunch of artists again using it this year. We think it's part of an ongoing evolution of artists taking control of delivering that ticket at their price. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And then this is Joe, Amy. On the concert mix, because all of the on-site revenues, $2.5 growth that Michael spoke about, all gets reported within the Concerts segment and that is \u2013 flows through at a very high margin. Absolutely, you're correct. When you have a shift in activity towards the amphitheaters, you would naturally see some margin expansion on the Concert business. As I think, we've talked in the past, I think, for the Concert business this year, we absolutely expect AOI to grow at an even more rapid rate than revenue because of that shift. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brandon Ross with BTIG. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Thanks for taking the question. So I know this summer for some of the high profile tours like Taylor and Beyonc\u00e9, you've raised price with the design of kind of smoking out brokers. But it looks like ticket sales for some of those shows are pretty relatively weak. How much of a sales lift do you expect there to be closer to the \u2013 closer to when those shows actually happen and how do you think about the tradeoff between attendance and price? And finally, can you kind of talk through the pluses and minuses of the strategy to take the brokers out of the equation. Thanks. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: All right. Brandon, I'll unpack that. We're not the promoter on Taylor Swift in America. So I don't know what those counts are. So, I can't comment on what pricing strategy they had there. We are doing Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z stadium tour. And that, I'm not sure what you're referencing there because the tour overall is very successful, would be close to over 90% sold. And by the time the show has all happened, we'll be close to sellout. So, no issues on selling. No tradeoff was put forward there. Priced aggressively, but also selling aggressively. But you are right. In theory, overall, what we like to talk to artists about is find that fine line. If you sell out at 10 :01, you, in theory, probably have underpriced your show. So, when you sell out at 10 :01 and there's eight pages of secondary sites selling your ticket at a higher price, you probably had pricing opportunity. So, artists are always the great brand manager trying to find that sweet spot between monetizing the show, as well as staying true to what the brand position is on pricing. So, I think, our thesis, overall, we talk about is every year, we see that the artist is pricing the house smarter, higher in the front end, maybe lower in the back end, and trying to take advantage of some of that secondary market that lives outside of their pot. So, overall, year-after-year, I think for the next five, six, seven years, you'll see artists every year climb back more from secondary into their own pricing and monetizing it themselves, which is great for our business. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Great. And then just to follow-up on The New York Times, is \u2013 that investigation is now fully over with, it sounds like? Just to confirm. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, there are the three venues that we noted that they've asked us questions about. So, we've given them information and we're not doing anything. But for the entire consent decree period, they've got the right to be coming back and asking us questions. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So this is a little bit of a strange question. But I guess I never really looked at the Ticketmaster growth prior to the Live Nation Ticketmaster combination until this New York Times article came out. And one of the things that surprised me is Ticketmaster's growth didn't really accelerate post the transaction. So I know it's a strange question because you guys had a good quarter and the results have been very strong at Ticketmaster along the way. But what evidence do you guys look at to know that the flywheel is actually working because when I look at that pre-deal, post-deal growth at Ticketmaster, it's not obvious I guess from the outside? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, one of the things, Jason, that we look at is, is the portion of the Ticketmaster growth that's being driven by the Concert business. And as we said for this quarter, that it was 80% of the GTV growth was driven by the Concert business. I think, part of this is you need to separate out the fee-bearing versus the non-fee-bearing. The fee-bearing being \u2013 sorry, the non-fee-bearing being a historically static season ticket volume that can historic growth rates. But if you look just at the fee-bearing GTV, I would have to believe we've got a substantially accelerated growth which is driven in good part by the fact that we've grown our Concert business. I don't remember the exact numbers in 2010 but call it 30-odd million fans to what should be now 90 million fans this year and with a very high portion of those fee going through Ticketmaster and being another way that we're continuing to monetize the overall events. So, I'm not sure what the facts are that you have, but that's how we look at it. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. Your release had noted that the show count for amps is up 27% this year, and I think, your 10-K has stated North America amp attendance last year was around 16 million. I know there're other factors to consider such as the mix of amp shows. But can we assume a similar growth rate for North America amp attendance this year? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think, it's a little bit early in the year. We still have all of our \u2013 almost all of our shows to play off. I think we gave you the guidance overall where we think the net balance between mix shift and volume increase in the amps will play out to around 90 million fans overall. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just on the Rock in Rio acquisition, can you just talk about how this changes your outlook for expansion in South America and then what you see is the opportunity to expand the brand to other territories? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. It gives us a great beacon in South America. We're now in 40 countries. We've been, over the last 15 years, good at entering markets. We tend to find an access point, either a promoter, existing promoting business, or a historic festival, which is attached to usually a great operator. Rock in Rio, one of the greatest festivals in the world, so good credible jump to our Brazilian business, and that will now be a real beacon for building around our Brazil and into the other South American markets, obviously sends a very loud signal to all of the potential partners we've been looking to bolt on to down there that we are serious about South America. Over the last couple of years, we've been put in lots of Metallica and Coldplay, U2 stadium tours throughout the region. So, we've got great partners, great experience. Now, we're going to turn that with Rock in Rio, turn it into a actual Live Nation businesses down there. This will be the start. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks. Couple of, sort of, boring financial questions and then a bigger picture question. Kathy, on the accounting treatment of the nonrecoups, on page 24 of the 10-Q, it looks like there is a \u2013 to net out the impact on AOI, there's a kind of other and elimination of a negative $1.2 million, so is that a one-time thing or is that to \u2013 is that something one should assume going forward? I mean, it's a small number but it lowers the AI impact add-back of nonrecoups. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: That will continue going forward. That's just eliminating some of the nonrecoup activity between Live Nation and Ticketmaster. So that's why we're adding back the net number. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then in terms of your restatement for last year, I mean, the segment elimination revenue figure and loss figure is down dramatically from a year ago. So, I assume that's the nonrecoup change. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Correct. So, yes, we've adjusted last year's to match the new accounting. So, what you're seeing in the Q, gives you consistent accounting between 2017 and 2018. But so, everything therein, the total and Ticketing had to be adjusted. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then finally, sort of bigger picture, how much did acquisition sort of ballpark impact particularly Ticketing in the quarter at large because you have been pretty active on that front? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, we've been pretty active. But any given year, it's \u2013 I don't know the exact numbers, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't 80%-plus organic. The acquisitions we tend to make tend to be bolt-on acquisitions that we're then driving growth from. Most of the acquisitions we're making are concert promoters and festivals that we then bring the Ticketing, the Sponsorship components into. Ticketing acquisitions we tend to make are pieces of technology hires not material in any kind of near-term driving of our AOI growth. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to David Joyce with Evercore. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. Couple questions on the Latin American concert front. First, on Rock in Rio, could you provide some more detail there why is it that you're not consolidating until next year? Is it just because there's no activity this year? And what's your growth plans there because they've sort of alternated into some \u2013 in different regions? Is that a brand that you're going to take more globally? And then secondarily, you talked about the volume tripling there. Is that just from the new hires or is it \u2013 that you've done in the region or has that been from just a heightened level of concert activity, or how should we think about that kind of allocation there? Thank you. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Rock in Rio happens every couple years. So 2019 is the next Rock in Rio. So that's why the business will be active then. It's not much of a business in between. Overall, we look at \u2013 we've said on a global basis, we think that now that the artist is unlocked on a global basis and demand in stadiums from Columbia to Cape Town is the same as Detroit. Thanks to the Internet, YouTube and Spotify everybody knows about the new Drake single this morning. So our job is to build this global platform. The major cities around the world where these superstar artists can continue to tour as they look to travel the world and tour more and more markets in South America, in Asia and in Eastern Europe. So, South America is a market we've \u2013 we always go slow, we always go down, find partners, get to understand the market, get to understand all the players. And then when we think we can find acquisitions of current partners with great history and operational skills, we tend to look to acquire them and then add our synergies to that market to drive our growth. So we look at Latin America as a strong market overall in the long term. Artists as I said, Coldplay, U2, Metallica, Rihanna, Shakira, most artists now when we look at their global touring, those hundred shows that they may allocate, they're all looking now to say Latin America is a 15 city kind of tour out of the hundred available dates. And we want to make sure we're able to monetize those dates to the markets. And Rock in Rio is by far an incredible asset to build our operations around. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. But Joe, just a quick question there, I think, you mentioned that the shift in onsales from Q2 into Q1, how much did that had in the quarter? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Probably now it's just a chunk of the impact for Ticketing. It only impacted our Ticketing segment, and it was a piece of our over-delivery relative to where we thought we would be a couple of months ago. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. But that wouldn't impact the numbers through the end of April, right? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, no. Just \u2013 it would be a bit of increase in terms of our Ticketmaster ticket sales through April. Just for some of the \u2013 if you phased in one or two of the bigger onsales into Q2 versus Q1. Not a huge impact. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. And then, Michael, I guess any kind of color or is there an initiative that kind of stands out where the extra average spend per fan is coming from this year? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I would say it's more structural. I think over the last few years, we've been adding that DNA to our business. Historically, we were a great concert promoter, and we were a great marketer of tickets and we weren't a great hospitality business. So when we brought our \u2013 some outside skillset in, we reorganized our venue business last year to put more focus around the true experience at amphitheaters, put some resources against that. We start to see some real activity and some real buy-in on the local level. So I think the amount of overall initiatives we have across our 50 amphitheaters this year would be at an all-time high in terms of new POS, new product lines, speed to play in the lines, more washrooms, a whole host of initiatives we've put together this year in the quest to grow $2 plus. So, great execution with a new leadership team that comes with the hospitality background foreseeing some real focus across our amphitheaters. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then I guess the investment in Blink Identity, it seems like an interesting concept. Is this kind of how you envision the future of fans entering the \u2013 entering a show or \u2013 I guess what stands out about this versus maybe like a radio frequency or something like that? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: All right. These are some very talented guys that have come out with what we consider to be a very interesting technology that lets you tie in your overall identity to the tickets. And for us, it's part of what we've tried to redefine Ticketmaster as over the past several years. And one of the reasons why we do think it's more successful now is, we're willing to look at outside technologies, outside partners, how it is we can bring them in and enhance the overall fan experience, make things more effective for the venues. Whether this becomes the solution for everything or whether this becomes interesting product for a number of clients is to be determined. We just think it's the important part of where we're moving the Ticketmaster DNA to. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And then I guess just last one from me. It seems like over the last couple years, you've experimented with some kind of unique offerings such as the $20 National Concert Week, the Festival Passports. Just wondering if you could maybe talk about the fan appetite out there for some of these differentiated types of packages, and maybe how you kind of see these type of offerings evolving in the future? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: We're in the same business of hotels and airlines. Midnight, the product is not worth anything. So, our job is to continually figure out ways to get that casual fan, who wasn't going to end up going to that show, to think about going to our show. So we've got an incredible database set. We've got a great internal team. And their mission the last couple of years is to wake up and figure out how do we create these holistic scale offers that can drive casual fans to come to the venue and at scale. Because of our business, we can deliver those offerings with real impact. So we think they're very effective. You'll see us continually look to be in that business of consumer offerings that are going to drive both the low end, whether it's a price discount or a high-end on a VIP experience. We think lots of opportunity to keep delivering segment value offers to our audience at scale. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll go to our next question from John Tinker with Gabelli. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Hi. Your cousins at Pandora tried and failed to enter the ticketing business. Spotify is emerging as the leading streaming company, and they're beginning to look a little more at ticketing. Is there anything you see there at all which could suggest they will do a better job? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I don't even know what that means, Tinker. I know Daniel pretty well. I don't see much of a ticketing company over at Spotify, so it was a nice jump. But what are you asking? John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: No. I'm asking if you think they could actually get in the ticketing business or if there's any evidence that this is real. I mean, the Pandora guys really I don't think had any idea what they're doing. That's why the new team have gone out of it, whereas Spotify has been pretty effective. Their problem is that they're not structured to make money. They have to change their business model and they've talked openly about that issue and how they need to add new services and ticketing is an obvious area. I just wonder if there's any evidence they're actually getting anywhere. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: We think \u2013 we've got a ton of respect for Daniel. He's new at the game as we saw yesterday. So, I think, he's got a big mission ahead of him and some staying in his lane, driving the streaming business against the Apples and the Amazons of the world. We have a partnership. We've been doing our API at Spotify like other places for a while. But at the core, I don't think Spotify is someone that's looking to get into our business nor are we looking to get in the streaming business. But we'll look at all those partners. There's some distribution opportunity for some incremental tickets. But at the core, we'll stay in our lane and we think we have lots of opportunity. John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Great. Thank you. Good quarter. Operator : We'll go for our next question to John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit about the Sponsorship business. One of the things that kind of looking at the growth rates here that kind of jumped out at me was it appears like the new data international side of Sponsorship performed really well this quarter. And I just wanted to ask where you see the runway for that business? As you look at things, do you see that maybe you've gotten a lot of the low hanging fruit on the U.S. side and there's huge opportunities on the international side. I'm just kind of curious to assess the progress you've made the last three or four years on Sponsorship. And has there been a geographic focus and is the runway internationally maybe bigger than we think? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank you. We think runway \u2013 we think Sponsorship \u2013 the same for 14 years, Sponsorships got a lot of runway ahead of it. It is one of the foundations to what we do for a living. It's not an ancillary business, it's what we do. And we think that the wind at our back with experiences, you talk to any CMO, any brand in the marketplace, they're all looking at how do I connect with customers in this new age. And when we tell them we got 91 million and we know where they're going to be on a Thursday and what seat they're going to be in, we have a great platform. So we look at both international, U.S. Canada, we think every day that we \u2013 Brazil now with Rock in Rio as we keep building our flywheel of concerts, we think we know that that drives our audience and our sponsorship potential with brands who are hungry for some of their budget to be allocated to this experience space. So what we think \u2013 we think the market in the U.S. and Canada we still have a lot of room because it's a market where we continually are able to create great products. We have such a great asset base here. So we think the runway here is different in the sense of it's got a lot of levers around it. We have Lollapalooza and amphitheaters, incredible asset base that still has great runway. International just got good runway because it's new to us in a lot of markets. I mean we have zero in Brazil and next year and in like couple years, we'll have more there, so more about markets international as we've been growing those, we're able to ramp up sponsorship. So higher growth rate from the sake of there was a lower base, but we think both markets will continually have good double digit runway for years to come. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Great. And then just one clarification question I know you talked about the double digit AOI growth for the year. In the fourth quarter, there was kind of the hit on the legal settlement I think of $110 million that you ran through the AOI in that lines, I believe. If we think about that 10% or the double digit growth rate that maybe you're talking to for the year, should we be maybe adjusting that AOI number grossing in higher to reflect that legal settlement? Just trying to put that in context. And then just lastly, just one comment, thank you for the color on the DoJ and The New York Times issue. I thought you guys really provided some useful color there, and thank you for being transparent on that front. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank you. We worked hard on it. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. On the AOI, yes, we're talking about adjusted for Songkick. So take last year, add back the $110 million and then the growth comes off of that. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session and brings to the end today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And it is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2018 conference call. We've continued our strong performance in the second quarter with AOI up 18%, revenue up 7%, and free cash flow up 14%. Each of our businesses contributed to these results, all delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter. We have built the industry's most scalable and unparalleled live platform, bringing over 550 million fans in 40 countries to live events each year. With our key metrics in Concerts, Sponsorship and Ticketing, all pacing ahead of last year, I'm confident that 2018 will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the company. Starting with our concert business, which is our flywheel, and through July we have sold 70 million tickets to shows this year, almost 3 million tickets more than last year at this point, putting us on track to have over 90 million fans in our concerts this year. In the second quarter, we promoted 9,000 shows for over 25 million fans, delivering a 13% increase in AOI and 6% revenue growth. As we previously indicated, this year will be particularly strong in our amphitheaters, with attendance up double-digits to the second quarter and on track to grow by 3 million fans for the full year. Given our ability to drive high-margin on-site spending with this audience, these additional fans are highly profitable. At the same time, we continue improving on-site experience at our amphitheaters, driving increased spend per fan, with additional points of sale, improved product mix and optimized pricing. From this and other initiatives, we expect spend per fan to accelerate this year increasing by $2.5 to $3. We also continue to capture greater value for the artists and Live Nation through pricing optimization, delivering more of the market value to the artists. As a result, average ticket pricing is up double-digits in amphitheaters and arenas so far this year, driving a $500 million increase in revenue for the year, assuming consistent price increases continue. Through the second quarter, we have booked 5,000 arena and amphitheater shows, up 18% over this point last year, putting us on track to sell over 90 million tickets of 32,000 shows and deliver double-digit AOI growth in our concert business. Our Sponsorship business continues to grow rapidly, with AOI up 14% and revenue 12% for the quarter. The strength of our platform and our ability to provide direct engagement with over 90 million fans has enabled us to continue building relationships with strategic brands that have driven much of our growth. This group accounts for 75% of our total sponsorship and the number of these sponsors has grown double digits this year, as we have added relationships with companies such as American Eagle, General Mills, R\u00e9my Martin. As a result, the committed spend by these strategic sponsors is also up double-digits through mid-July. Festivals provide a key opportunity for sponsors to engage fans at a time when they are receptive to such brand messages. Our European festivals have grown particularly strong in the second quarter, with revenue per fan at these festivals up 12%. Overall, through July, we are pacing double-digits ahead of last year in committed revenue, with 90% of our planned revenue for the year committed. Given this, I expect we delivered double-digit AOI growth in Sponsorship again this year. Ticketmaster continues to demonstrate that it's the best marketplace for venues, team and artist to sell tickets to fans globally, with GTV growth on fee-bearing tickets up 11% this quarter. As a result, Ticketmaster's AOI for the quarter was up 15% and revenue up 13%. At its core, Ticketmaster continues to be the most effective ticketing platform in the world, with the technology to service venues, sports teams and artists and the marketplace to attract and convert ticket buyers. Our digital ticketing rollout is proceeding on plan with Phase 1 in 2018 focusing on deploying our Presence access control systems. To date, we have installed Presence systems in 125 venues, with another 75 venues planned in the second half of this year, positioning us to have at least 60 million fans using this system next year. In addition to building technologies to better service our venues, artists and teams, we continue investing to make Ticketmaster an even better marketplace for fans to buy tickets. In broadening ticketing options for fans, we have increased the number of events listed on Ticketmaster by 16% this year to almost 280,000 events through June. From a fan behavior standpoint, we continue to see an ongoing shift to mobile, and following a redesigned purchase experience, mobile ticketing sales were up 34% for the year, now accounting for 40% of all ticket sales, with mobile conversion rates up double-digits. Overall, Ticketmaster results are validating our strategy of delivering efficient marketplace for fans to buy tickets, while providing a great enterprise software solution to venues, teams and artists looking to maximize the value of their events. With this strategy's continued success, I expect us to deliver high-single digit growth in Ticketing AOI this year. In summary, 2018 is on track for the company to deliver double-digit AOI growth, along with strong gains in revenue and free cash flow. Each of our businesses is contributing to this success, as we put on more concerts for a greater number of fans, continue to monetize fans who come to the shows and sell more tickets to events of all types and further demonstrate the value of our 90 million fans to sponsors. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details of our performance this quarter. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Before I get into the division numbers, as a reminder, we're now comping against Q2, 2017, which was our highest AOI growth quarter ever, with $40 million or 22% overall AOI growth, including 51% Concerts AOI growth and 21% Sponsorship AOI growth. Against that backdrop, this quarter was our third largest AOI growth quarter ever, with AOI up another 18%. Getting into our business segments, first Concerts, Live Nation Concerts' AOI in the second quarter was up 13% and revenue was up 6%. Driving that growth, Concerts had its highest second quarter attendance ever, including arena attendance growth of 17%, with over 7.5 million fans, amphitheater attendance growth was up 14% and is trending to grow by 3 million fans this year, and global festival attendance was up 3% across 33 festivals in the second quarter, with record crowds at 14 of these festivals. Looking to the full year, again, this year we expect to promote about 20 of the top 25 global tours and we have already sold almost 70 million tickets for shows this year through July, an increase of 4%, consistent with our expectation of surpassing 90 million fans for the full year. Our pipeline of amphitheater and arena shows continues to be very strong with over 5,000 shows booked through July, up 18% compared to this point last year. Festival ticket sales are up double-digits through July and we expect our 100-plus festivals will host almost 9 million fans this year. Coming off the biggest stadium year in the history of the company in 2017, we expect our stadium show count and attendance will be a bit lower this year, but will still be our second-largest stadium year ever, with over 250 shows globally. As we now have good visibility into the full year, we expect double-digit growth in amphitheater on-site spending, increased ticket pricing and mid-single digit growth in fan attendance, and we are therefore confident that we will again deliver solid double-digit growth of Concerts' AOI for the full-year. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business, our Sponsorship business benefited from our Concerts flywheel, helping drive AOI up 14% this quarter, while revenue was up 12%. In the second quarter, over 60% of the AOI growth was from Sponsorship, split fairly evenly between North America and International. Our North America online business drove the remaining AOI growth for the quarter, driven by new ad units in the financial services category. Based on the Sponsorship & Advertising net revenue now contracted for the year, we're confident we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full-year. Finally, Ticketmaster, for the second quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 15% and revenue up 13%. Total global GTV was up 7% for the quarter and global fee-bearing GTV was up 11%. This came from a 9% increase in primary GTV and 29% growth in secondary GTV. North America was the primary driver of our fee-bearing GTV growth, up 15% for the quarter. Concerts activity continues to be the primary driver of GTV growth, accounting for approximately 80% of primary GTV growth so far this year and secondary growth was also heavily driven by concerts, with sports, and notably, the NFL also providing material growth in the quarter. Based on our results for the first half and our second half pipeline, we expect Ticketmaster to deliver high-single digit AOI growth for the full year. In summary, now more than halfway through the year, we are confident that 2018 will be another year of record top line and AOI results overall and for each of our businesses. On a few specifics, we expect Q3 AOI overall to be up low-double digits, and on FX, we had a 1% to 2% positive impact on the business in Q2 and expect to largely give back in Q3 what we gained in Q2. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe and good afternoon everyone. Our key financial highlights for the second quarter of 2018, our revenue was up 7% to $2.9 billion. AOI increased 18% to $260 million. Free cash flow adjusted was $176 million, up 14% compared to the second quarter of 2017. And as of June 30, our deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.6 billion. The increase in revenue was across all our segments. Concerts was up $131 million or 6%, driven by arena and amphitheater activities. Sponsorship was up 12%, with growth in both North America and Europe, and Ticketing revenue was up 13% from increased fee-bearing ticket volumes. Our AOI growth of 18% for the second quarter was again driven by all three segments with each delivering double-digit growth. Our operating income for the quarter was $135 million, a 19% increase over last year, driven by the growth in AOI. And net income for the quarter was $69 million, as compared to $81 million last year, due to the impact of higher interest expense and non-controlling interest expense, along with increases in net foreign exchange rate losses. For the quarter, the impact of earnings per share from the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was $17 million, fairly consistent with the first quarter of 2018. For the first six months of 2018, revenue was up 11% to $4.4 billion. AOI increased 19% to $374 million and free cash flow adjusted was $222 million, up 23%. All of our segments delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and AOI for the first six months. The majority of the revenue growth in the first half of the year was in the Concerts segment, up 10%, largely from increased show count and attendance in arenas and amphitheaters. Sponsorship & Advertising revenue increased 14%, with strong growth in North America, and Ticketing revenue was up 16% from higher fee-bearing ticket sales. AOI growth for the first six months was from strong increases across all three segments. Operating income was up 40% to $129 million from the increase in AOI. And net income for the first half of the year was $35 million compared to $48 million last year, due to the impact of higher interest expense and non-controlling interest expense, along with increases in net foreign exchange rate losses. For the first six months, the impact to earnings per share from the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was $34 million, and we currently estimate that the impact for the full year will be approximately $75 million, with the remainder for the year fairly consistent across the last two quarters. Moving to our balance sheet, as of June 30, we had total cash of $2.3 billion, including $734 million in ticketing final cash and $1.1 billion in net concert event related cash, leaving free cash of $458 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months was $520 million compared to $805 million last year, due to the timing of event-related working capital amounts, primarily related to artist deposits impairments to ticketing clients. Our total capital expenditures were $94 million for the first six months, with over half spent on revenue-generating items. We currently expect total capital expenditures for 2018 to be approximately $250 million, with roughly half on revenue-generating CapEx. As of June 30, our total net debt was $2.8 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.1%. For the remainder of 2018, we currently expect that non-cash compensation expense in the second half of the year will be fairly consistent to the first six months, and acquisition expenses and interest expense for each of the last two quarters of 2018 will be similar to the second quarter of 2018. Thank you for joining us today. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : We'll go first to Brandon Ross at BTIG. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Couple of questions actually. If you look back at your geographic mix over the last several years, International has maintained a pretty constant share of, I guess, your revenue and AOI. What in your mind has held International back from becoming a bigger part of your business? Is balance sheet or access to capital your biggest constraint to unlocking your global opportunity? And then I have some follow-ups. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And thanks, Brandon. No, I don't think the context is that we've been holding back the International growth. The great news is the U.S. business has continued to grow at exceptional rates. So we look at both a global footprint of huge International opportunity long term, but we also see in the U.S. a market that still has great runways and a lot of markets that we're still not in, cities within the U.S., sponsorship and pricing, monetization and amphitheaters alone as we keep talking about, that's going to be a big growth driver for us for the next few years as we increase per heads. So the U.S., we've just continually executed across our platform, been able to grow it and drive both revenue and AOI, while we've been equally growing the International business both at TM, Sponsorship and Concerts. So we think over long term, like most businesses that are global, we think that the International opportunity will continue to be a long-term great opportunity from a revenue and AOI. You've seen us move into markets like South America and Asia, South Africa and Eastern Europe, and those markets were relatively zero market share, will continue to be great long-term opportunities. So we think the business both is a U.S., Canadian opportunity for the next 5 years at minimum to keep monetizing our current business while we grow it and we'll keep growing internationally across our businesses. We don't see any real capital constraints. There has never been an acquisition or a bolt-on or something that we want to do that our balance sheet hasn't afforded us. As you know that, I think the beautiful story of Live Nation is we're not looking for large acquisitions outside of the core, it's still a very fragmented, mom-and-pop business on a global basis. So we've been able to take advantage of our bolt-on strategy, whether it's in Philadelphia or Milan, whether it's a festival or concert promoter or a venue. We can buy those with our current balance sheet. We're really good at synergizing those on a global basis and making them accretive very fast. So, we don't see any constraints to our balance sheet. We have a lot of capacity left on our balance sheet. But at the end of the day, most things we're looking to buy are going to be accretive, because they're down the center field of our core business. And when we buy a festival in Milan, a promoter in South Africa, we're bringing instant revenue and AOI to that business from our ticket sponsorship and content pipe. So continue to see growth both global, U.S. and our current balance sheet can continue to power that growth. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Great. And driving primary ticket price has been a big initiative for you guys and I guess industry wide this year. As you look back on the first half, do you believe taking price on tickets has been a successful endeavor for the industry? And do you plan to continue to push price as we think about 2019? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I think we've talked out loud that there's still \u2013 it's not a precise number because it's not tracked, but $8 billion is used, but there is a huge secondary business that still exists, which still means that pricing inefficiency is alive and well for both sports teams and great artists, where the product primary price sold is leaving a lot of money on the table. So, we've said it over the last couple of years, I'll probably saying it for the next five years, as the market becomes more efficient, meaning the artists, the sports team, the content owner has a larger appetite to price higher, to take some of those tickets out of the business, the opportunity will be an ongoing annual opportunity for us at Live Nation, as we try to convince content that one of the great ways to maximize and minimize scalping is to maximize your pricing strategy. Now, there's also ways that you got to lower the prices in the backend of the house to make sure you sell through and there's no one simple strategy, but overall pricing and increasing the P1s or the VIP tickets or the platinum tickets, we do know is a great way to take some of the secondary business and turn it into the pockets of the artist and the sports team. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And Brandon \u2013 yeah, Brandon, just giving you a few specific numbers, again, as Michael mentioned, amph and arena pricing is up double-digit so far this year. And at this pace, we'll deliver another $500 million this year to artists, and we think that's maybe 10% of the secondary opportunity. So, long runway to continue doing it, as we continue to get better and better pricing models and artists get more comfortable that they're the ones who should be getting that money as opposed to brokers. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Great. And just a quick housekeeping, can you speak to the mix of amphitheater shows in Q2 versus Q3? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: It would be roughly 30% as Kathy is double checking, but I'd say it's about 30% Q2, 70% Q3. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Great. Thanks for the questions. Operator : And we'll go next to John Janedis at Jefferies. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Maybe somewhat of a follow-up to Brandon's question, but on the Sponsorship & Advertising business, you guys talked about European festivals, but with some of the acquisitions you've done and the global expansion, what opportunities are ahead for maybe LatAm or Asia to be more of a growth driver? Are the U.S. clients making more global buys now as a result, or will it be a combination, or regional and global and or local? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, our business is all three. We're selling \u2013 out of our 900 sponsors, we have a lot of sponsors that are buying the local Milan or Tampa Bay advertising package at an arena or amphitheater series. We have a regional business. And then you have the strategic global clients. So it works on all levels. The more \u2013 when we buy a festival and promoter and move into a market in Germany, it provides our Sponsorship team instant inventory for the local and regional sponsorship buy, which you need as a foundation. And when my team is talking to the CMO, CEO, at a global organization being \u2013 obviously laying out our platform and all of our touch points, and the more markets that we can touch, the more of an opportunity will present to that global brand. So, we are always been a combination of a local business with a central strategy and a central buying strategy. But you need local execution to drive both the sponsorship and then ultimately the concert. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Got it. And maybe separately, over time on Presence, do you get to 90 million plus or 100 million fans over time with that or is it cost prohibitive as you move towards smaller venues? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, there is no cost limitation on it. It's just the ramp up. We expect fairly quickly for it to become the standard access control system. John Janedis - Jefferies LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to David Karnovsky at JPMorgan. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. We've recently seen your theater and club division at the new venues in Cleveland, and before that, Denver, can you just provide more color on the opportunity you see in this space? And then separately, do you see potential to expand your North America amphitheater footprint at all, just given the success you're having with on-site? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank you. We look at our business and there's multiple channels we want to continue to grow in. Festivals, we've talked about, and within festivals, the 100-plus we have now in that channel, there's sub-strategies within that. So we look at theaters and clubs the same. On a global basis, we're probably close to 200 that we may manage, lease or book, in some sense, U.K., Australia, Canada and the U.S. That division has been growing because you read about the explosion of the experience, and probably in your local town, what used to be a dance bar or a club now is a live bar and live music is alive and well, and 500 seat venues, and 2,000 and 4,000 seats. So, we've seen a new surge, whether it's in retail developments, malls being converted, where everyone is looking for a live club as a \u2013 one of their anchor tenants. So, we're talking to lots of developers all the time about adding a House of Blues or a film or one of our many 500 to 5,000 seat venues that are high margin, provide incredible platform for us, for our sponsorship, and our young artist network. So we're going to continue to looking in markets on a global basis, and if there's an opportunity with the right retail developer or a developer or a location that we think works, then we'll continue to expand there. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, on the opportunity to expand your North America amphitheater footprint at all? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Same thing. We think the amphs are \u2013 again, lots of cities don't have amphitheater or lots of times the amphitheater is 40 miles outside of town and there's a new urban opportunity like in Boston and Toronto. So, whether we're looking in the U.S., Canada at upgrading or elevating our current position or we're looking at some international markets where we think \u2013 an outdoor amphitheater is a great experience. In our research, if you ask fans where do they want to see their band of choice, it's kind of obvious they want to see U2 in a small club than they'd love to see them outdoors where they can dance and have fun, and then the list goes on from there. So, we know amphitheaters and outdoor experience, social gathering, all those good things is a real important value proposition, and we'll continue to look for places to expand that makes sense for us. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just on Ticketing, I think you did 16% AOI growth in the first half and you've got into high-single digit growth for the year. Can you just walk through some of the puts and takes for how to think about growth in the back-half? Thanks. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, this is Joe. We tend to see Q1 and Q4 as our largest quarters. Q4 is when the on-sales for the next summer starts, particularly driven by stadiums, and then in the Q1 for the arenas, and later in Q1 for the amphitheaters, and generally the size is a bit smaller in Q2 and then the smallest in Q3. So Q2 has got the trailing end of the amphitheaters and arenas and they're closed for the summer. And then Q3, you tend to have a lot less going on sale. So, less activity from the concert side. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll move next to Drew Borst at Goldman Sachs. Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Couple of questions if I may. Firstly, on the digital ticketing in the Presence system, then you guys talked about how you're going to ramp that up over the back-half of the year. Can you talk about the financial implications of rolling that out? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. These are not overly expensive systems frankly, our access controls. Our Presence systems are more standardized in terms of off-the-shelf components. So tend to actually be less expensive to deploy than it was for us to deploy our traditional systems. So, we don't think it's a meaningful cost, it's all within the CapEx estimates that Kathy is giving you, which is, I think sort of within our normal overall spending range. Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I was also wondering if, as you look out into next year, is there other benefits to revenue growth and some profit as you deploy it? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Absolutely, there are benefits, as we get the data from the digital ticketing in terms of who the individuals are, their behavior, that has a substantial unlocking the marketing on both the Ticketmaster and the Concert side, and also provides substantially more value for our sponsors in terms of their ability to understand who exactly they're engaging with. I don't think we're ready yet to declare the timing on those benefits. But there's no question that those benefits will be an important driver of our business in years to come. Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. And then on the on-site spending, I appreciate the update and the increase in the guidance for on-site spending this year. As you look at over the next couple of years, 2019, 2020, how do you think about the roadmap to continue driving that growth? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think what we've said is, we're very focused on getting that number to at least $30 to put us on parity with the major sports teams, and once we get to $30, we'll reassess and give you guys the guidance and direction from there. Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just last one from me, recently Ticketmaster had a data breach in London. Could you just give us some color on if there's any risk of a penalty, because I think this would fall under GDPR, which was recently implemented. But could you just give a little bit of color on that? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Just to correct one specific comment, it was a vendor of ours was breached. Ticketmaster systems were not breached. It resulted in the loss of some of our customer data, low single-digit percentage of our customers on a global basis. We're obviously working with the ICO, which is the EU GDPR body as they need to look at this. We do not expect any impact that will be material, given the number of people impacted, given our insurance profile, we don't see it as being a material risk. Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Ryan Sundby at William Blair. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on Drew's question on Presence there. As you kind of roll out these \u2013 the 200 systems, do they all turn on kind of immediately or is there some kind of ramp period there? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So the systems are all on immediately as you deploy them, and the systems are effectively, they're backward compatible. So, in general, to the extent there are any trailing PDFs out there, the systems can still take those and then on a go-forward basis, as it switches to all digital or a combination of digital and some sort of RFID or other stocks, then it can take those as well. So as we deploy them into our amphitheaters this summer, that was exactly how it worked, because there have been on-sales that had PDFs, those systems had to be able to be backwards compatible, taking those tickets as well. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks. That helps. And then, I guess, I was a little surprised to hear that this will still be the second largest stadium concert year for you guys. So maybe, mix, is it still as big of a headwind as you thought it would be this year or has that maybe improved as you kind of got into the season more? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think we've always said we expected to have fan growth this year. It's just that we didn't expect as many stadiums as we had last year. So, just was trying to make that clear that it is our second biggest year, because we didn't want too much read into it. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Doug Arthur at Huber Research. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks. A couple of questions. Just going back to mix, I mean, the number of events is up again really significantly, 17.5%, I think year-over-year for International and North America. The attendance was up nominally, 2%. So, obviously, you've talked a lot about the stadium mix. Is this just continuation of very strong club activity in the mix at this point? I know that was a factor in Q1. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes, absolutely. Theaters and club business has continued to be very strong for all the reasons that David alluded earlier in his question. So to us, it's all positive. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : And you guys have made a \u2013 obviously done a lot of partnerships and some acquisitions, is there any way of kind of breaking out that impact on growth in Q2 in terms of new editions? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. It would be small, small, small. In the scheme of our 32,000 shows, you've seen everything that we've acquired. There's nothing that really is a dramatic, move the needle in terms of that fan base. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then, finally, Kathy, on the amortization of non-recoups. It's down this quarter versus last quarter, of course, so are revenues at Ticketing. Should we expect sort of a similar kind of number in Q3 and then a fairly \u2013 a larger number in Q4, because of the seasonality? Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I mean, there's going to be a little bit of seasonality, and you can look at prior year, but we're still expecting full year to be consistent with last year. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to David Joyce at Evercore ISI. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide some color on the supply of content, how you will keep growing that next year. Certainly is \u2013 are there just \u2013 are there a lot more artists who are on the roads? I was just wondering if you could kind of frame it for us, where the supply is, because clearly there's still plenty of demand and plenty of pricing to come. If you could just help us think about that for next year? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. We've said the last few years, we think there's more bands on the road, there's more events happening and more geographies that are being played now. So we think next year, the year after, on a global basis, there'll be more artists on the road playing some venue from small to big, and more fans going to those shows from a supply, demand. So overall, we think the industry is having a great, continued growth phase and we think it will last for quite a while, especially as the international and global markets start to build more venues and infrastructure to emulate a lot of the U.S. infrastructure. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : And in terms of the ancillary revenue opportunities that you've created at the festivals and amphitheaters, when would you be fully build out on those opportunities where you own or operate the venues? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think we see there still being quite a substantial runway in terms of the opportunity. We've given you guys most of the information on amphitheaters, so they've been making nice progress. But as we really think in terms of the best-in-class hospitality, we think there's still substantial runway there. Festivals, again, there's some great ones like the BottleRocks out there, that are just phenomenal at how they're driving F&B and their overall average per fan spending. And as we bring more of that DNA into our other 100 festivals, still see a lot of ways to go in terms of driving those numbers. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Jason Bazinet at Citi. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just had a market share question. I think this is right, in Concerts, there's I think now four distinct revenue items, there's the money you get paid for promoting something, there's the food and beverage and ancillary, there is venues, and then there is Artist Nation. If you just focus on the promotion side of concerts and festivals globally, where do you think you are now in terms of market share? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So, on a global basis, we might be somewhere in the 20s to 30s. There's not a lot of great data on a lot of the international markets. But if you looked at small club dates to street festival, the market can be defined fairly broadly, but we've said out loud that we think somewhere in the 20% to 30% global market share, huge opportunity obviously on a global market still. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And then the other thing is just, we think that there's a lot of latent demand on top of the actual market today, especially for the top global talent that there hasn't had necessarily been the infrastructure to promote them through all of the markets. And as we do that, we think that will just build the market. So, that's the other reason that just makes it hard to give real, firm market share numbers today. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): If you don't win a mandate for some reason on the promotion side, someone turns you down, what's the most common reason? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: History another promoter, but... Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Lots of competition out there... Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: ...locally, different basis. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that will bring our question-and-answer session to an end and additionally bring to an end today's conference. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Live Nation had its best quarter ever and we are on track to deliver another record year of results across revenue, AOI and free cash flow. For the quarter, revenue was up 11% and AOI was up 16%. And year-to-date, revenue was up 11%, AOI up 17%, and free cash flow was up 22%. All our divisions, Concerts, Ticketing and Sponsorship, each delivered their strongest quarterly AOI results ever. Our Concerts business is our flywheel, attracting over 33 million fans to shows globally in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year which then drove record results in our onsite Ticketing and Sponsorship business. Through October, we have sold 85 million tickets for concerts in 2018, up 6% year-on-year, and we were on track to sell over 90 million tickets this year. With our strength in concert attendance growing, we're also seeing similar success in our onsite Sponsorship and Ticketing business, giving us confidence that 2018 will be another year of record results for Live Nation overall and for each of our divisions. Starting with our Concerts division, it continued to show strong global demand for Concerts through the third quarter. We drove an 8% increase in attendance to 71 million fans attending over 24,000 shows across 40 countries, driving revenue up 11% and AOI up 29% year-to-date. We have also grown our show count by 17% year-to-date to 24,000 shows, at the same time we have increased the revenue generated by each show through pricing optimization. Across arenas and amphitheaters, our average ticket price is up 14%, driven by front of house pricing which is up 25%. Collectively, these increases have grown artist revenue by over $300 million across roughly 6,000 shows. This summer, we also saw growth onsite to our hospitality initiatives at our amphitheaters, increasing our average revenue per fan by nearly $3 to almost $27. This is an increase of more than $6 per fan over the past three years as we have driven substantial improvements across our food and beverage, VIP, and parking programs. With the success of our Concerts flywheel, we're promoting more shows for more fans, more effectively pricing and selling tickets, and delivering a better fan experience than ever before. As a result, we will spend over $6 billion producing concerts this year, making Live Nation far and away the largest financial partner to musicians. In our high-margin Sponsorship business, we have continued our double-digit growth this year, with revenue up 11%, and AOI up 12% year-to-date as we delivered our best quarterly results ever for Sponsorship business. With 1,000 sponsors across our on-site and online platforms, Live Nation is the global leader in music sponsorship, providing brands with an opportunity to reach our core millennial audience as we again add new branded partners this quarter including T-Mobile, Sony, Pennzoil, Sterling wine, and Subway. On-site continues to be a key growth driver, and year-to-date our festival Sponsorship business was up 12% as we continue to find innovative ways to scale and connect brands with nearly 9 million fans attending over 100 festivals worldwide. Other key growth initiative is deepening and broadening our strategic brand relationships with now over 70 sponsors investing on our platform across multiple fronts. Collectively, the committed spend by this group is up 13% to nearly $350 million for the year, accounting for approximately 75% of our overall Sponsorship & Advertising revenue. With over 95% of our expected Sponsorship revenue for the year now contracted, we are confident we will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year. Ticketmaster continues building its position as the global ticketing marketplace leader, with 15% growth year-to-date in global fee-bearing GTV, driving revenue growth of 13%, and AOI growth of 11%.. Ticketmaster will deliver almost 500 million tickets worth approximately $31 billion GTV across 28 countries this year, making it the world's largest such marketplace. And the success of our marketplace is stronger than ever, as all three quarters in 2018 have been amongst the top five quarters ever for recognized GTV. During the third quarter, we continued our Presence digital ticketing rollout to NFL stadiums and many Live Nation buildings, bringing the install base to 177 venues. In the third quarter at these venues, we held over 1,500 events with over 3 million fans using mobile tickets for entry. We proved out the scalable capability of mobile ticket in the quarter with as many as 97% of the fans for some NFL games entering via mobile. For the fourth quarter, we expect digital ticketing growth to continue with another 10 million fans across 2,000 events, approximately 5 million of whom will enter using mobile tickets. The move to digital ticketing has meant that sports teams, venues and artists have much greater control over the ticket, enabling them to better control distribution, and ultimately the chain of custody for the tickets. Overall, Ticketmaster's results are validating our dual strategy of delivering a great marketplace for fans to buy tickets while providing the greatest enterprise tools to venues, teams and artists looking to control their tickets and maximize the value of their events. By continuing to do both effectively, I expect us to deliver high single-digit growth in Ticketing AOI this year. As we approach the end of 2018, we are confident that our strong performance will deliver another record year of top line AOI and free cash flow. All of our businesses, Concerts, Sponsorship and Ticketing have delivered growth year-to-date, and based on this key operating metrics, we expect each to deliver record revenue and AOI for the full year. As we look forward, we see tremendous opportunity to continue the global consolidation from our Concerts and Ticketing businesses and further growth in Sponsorship and Ticketing from the concerts' flywheel. With that, I will turn our call over to Joe to take you through more additional details on the divisional performance. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first Concerts. Live Nation Concerts revenue in the third quarter was up 12%, and AOI was up 30%. This was the best quarter in Live Nation Concerts history with 33 million fans attending 7,700 shows, delivering fan growth of 3.6 million in this quarter alone and bringing our fan growth for the year to-date to 5.4 million. Overall, our ticket sales for shows this year has accelerated over the past three months, increasing from 4% growth back in July to now being at 6% growth for October. All parts of this business continue to do well led by our top global tours, including five tours that have each sold over a million tickets this year, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, Kevin Hart (08:53), Justin Timberlake, Pink and Bruno Mars. And for the quarter, our arena and amphitheater shows were the largest growth driver, each adding 5.2 million fans in the quarter. At the same time, our show counts and fan base (09:08) our festivals and theaters and pubs while we had our second strongest stadium year ever trailing only last year. Looking at the fourth quarter, we see continued strong performance in our North America arena and theater and club shows, while internationally we are comping a very strong Q4 last year that had unusually heavy touring activity with U2, Coldplay and Bruno Mars all out. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business. Sponsorship & Advertising revenue for the third quarter grew by 8% and AOI was up 8% as well. Our growth for the year has been strong across both Sponsorship and online Advertising businesses with both growing revenue and AOI in the double digits year-to-date. And from a geographic perspective, both our North America and International markets have contributed similarly to our Sponsorship growth, while North America has driven our online advertising growth. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster revenue was up 8% and AOI was up 1%. Global GTV was up 3% for the quarter and 7% year-to-date, driven by fee-bearing GTV which was up 13% and 15% for the quarter and year-to-date respectively. Primary GTV was up 13% for the quarter and 14% year-to-date, and secondary GTV was up 11% for the quarter and is now up 22% year-to-date. As in the past, concerts, and particularly Live Nation concerts, are the largest growth driver of our Ticketing business. Ticketmaster remains first and foremost the world's top ticketing marketplace for artists, sports teams and venues to sell tickets to their fans with primary ticketing representing over 90% of our global GTV, and only approximately 2% of our concert tickets and 4% of our sports tickets are resold on our secondary platform. Michael gave you an update on the success we're having with our digital ticketing rollout, and at the same time we're continuing to see an overall shift in ticket sales to our mobile platform. We sold 45% of our tickets in the third quarter on mobile with sales up 37% year-on-year as we increased mobile visits by 27% and grew our app downloads by 30% to over 50 million. These results make it clear that the tickets have made the shift to mobile, giving us even greater confidence that digital ticketing will be rapidly adopted. Finally, our open distribution strategy continued selling more tickets for clients off-platform, up 23% with almost 12 million tickets sold year-to-date. And while margins move around quarter-to-quarter, we expect full year margins for Ticketing to be in line with last year. In summary, we're confident that 2018 will be another year of record revenue in AOI results overall and for each of our businesses. On FX, Q3 revenue and AOI were negatively impacted by about 1% with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. And for the full year, we expect the impact to be less than 1%. Looking at Q4, we expect another strong Concerts onsale for next year, which we project to drive up to $10 million in advertising expense growth, along with increased deferrals in Ticketmaster's recognition of Live Nation concert tickets. And I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the third quarter of 2018, our revenue was up 11% to $3.8 billion. AOI increased 16% to $386 million and free cash flow adjusted was $307 million, up 21% all compared to the third quarter of 2017. As of September 30, our deferred revenue related to future shows was $759 million. Revenue growth was driven by all our segments with the majority of the growth coming from Concerts, up 12%, from higher attendance and increased show count primarily in amphitheaters and arenas. Our AOI growth of 16% for the third quarter was also driven by the Concerts segment, which delivered 30% AOI growth. Operating income was $234 million, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year, and our net income for the quarter was $173 million, up 27% over last year both driven by the growth in AOI. For the third quarter, the impact to earnings per share from the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was $21 million, consistent with the same period last year. For the nine months of 2018, revenue was up 11% to $8.2 billion. AOI increased by 17% to $761 million and free cash flow adjusted was $529 million, up 22% compared to the prior year. Revenue growth for the nine months was driven by solid growth across all our segments. Concerts grew by a 11%, again delivering the majority of the revenue growth due to increased amphitheater and arena activity, along with the higher onsite spend per fan in our amphitheaters. Sponsorship and Advertising also grew by 11% and Ticketing revenue was up 13%. AOI through September was up 17% as each segment delivered double-digit growth. Operating income was up 24% to $363 million. Driven by the increase in AOI, it was also impacted by slightly higher depreciation and amortization expense. Net income for the nine months was $208 million, up 13% due to our growth in operating income after higher interest expense from our debt refinancing. For the 9 months, the impact to earnings per share from the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was 54 million and we currently estimate that the impact for the full year will be approximately $77 million. Moving to our balance sheet, as of September 30, we had total cash of $1.9 billion, including $734 million in Ticketing client cash and $553 million in net Concert event-related cash, with free cash of $613 million. As you look at our working capital accounts on the balance sheet, the growth over December of 2017 is driven by the normal seasonality of the business at this time of year and a bit higher given the overall growth of the business since last year. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months was $256 million compared to $418 million in 2017. To maintain just the working capital where the receivables increased, driven by the higher Concert activity in the third quarter and accrued liabilities were down because of the payment of the legal settlement accrued last year. Free cash flow adjusted through September was $529 million, an increase of 22% over last year. Our total capital expenditures were $169 million for the nine months, of which 53% was spent on revenue generating items. We currently estimate that total capital expenditures for 2018 will be approximately $250 million, roughly half of which will be spent on revenue generating CapEx. As of September 30, our total net debt was $2.8 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.1%. For the fourth quarter of 2018, we currently expect that stock-based compensation expense and acquisition expenses will be in line with the third quarter of this year. Thank you for joining us today. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our first question from Brandon Ross with BTIG. Please go ahead. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions, I have a few. For Michael, you mentioned ticket pricing optimization in the prepared remarks. I guess the expansion of platinum ticketing and price increases were a big part of the strategy this year. Do you expect this as something that we're going to see a lot more of in 2019? Is there still a lot of room there? And what has been the feedback from artists and fans? Then I have some follow-up. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Brandon. Yeah, we believe that we kind of had this theme we've talked about for a while on tickets continually be probably the most inefficiently priced product in the world. I mean, there is literally no other product in the world that is worth more than it's sold a second later. Generally, what you do is you increase your price. But we know we had this balance of the artist, this incredible brand manager and he has to find that fine line of what does Bruce Springsteen charge for the front row versus what the market will bear. So we know that we don't expect the business to be completely efficient market-wise because it will probably be a contradiction to maybe what the artist stands for, but we do know that $8 billion number is that they throw around on the size of the secondary market with the price gap. We do know every year the artist is looking more and more at, I have to figure out through VIP Platinum P1 (18:57) how to charge more for the front because I can't continually let it just be sold on the secondary market. So we think we're in that first, second inning of that game. We think there's a long great path forward where the artists will continually look to increase the pricing. Now, the advantage is we get to decrease the pricing in the back part of the house. Generally, our problem, in any concert, we never have the back sold but not the front. As you know, the house usually is, the front is sold and we're trying to fill the rest of the house. So the lower we can price the backend and the higher we can price the frontend is the optimate pricing for both the gross and for sell-through. So this is just a new kind of concept of dynamic pricing and increasing the pricing in the front. We're in the first or second inning and we think we have lots of pricing opportunity for years to come. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Great. And then I was wondering if you could unpack your outlook for especially Ticketing a little bit. How will the timing of onsales this year versus last impact the phasing of AOI at Ticketmaster between Q4 and 2019 and maybe how accounting changes here and abroad may also impact AOI at Ticketing? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, Brandon. I'll take a leap for the first part. This is Joe. Our expectation is, is that next year is going to be another very good year. As I've said in some of my comments, we see a strong setup of onsales in Q4, the benefit of which is certainly on the Ticketing side with Ticketmaster recognizing a number of those tickets, particularly the non-Live Nation side of any tickets that get sold in Q4. Part of the impact is also on the Concerts side. Through the accounting, you expense your advertising for non-sale when \u2013 in the period it takes place. So our large onsales that we'll have as we do particularly a stadium, big arena tours will be recognized in Q4 in in the Concerts part of the business. And then I'll let Kathy speak to what the accounting means for some of the recognition. Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. And it's less about changes next year versus this year in the accounting, it's more just the fact that we're expecting more of those tickets to be sold for Live Nation events by Ticketmaster, and because of that, for the tickets we control, we defer those to next year. So that's what Joe was addressing in his prepared remarks on that. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Great. And then just one more. Your acquisition strategy has generally been to use cash to fund your inorganic growth. And as rates come up and the environment changes a little bit, do you expect to only continue to do cash acquisitions, or would you consider starting to use your stock a little more as well? Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, we absolutely consider both and we'll look depending on the size of the acquisition. Obviously, our cash, we're pretty happy with our debt structure right now but have room in our leverage ratio. We're in a pretty comfortable space, so we'll look at overall the AOI that'll be coming in and start to consider at least a combination of cash and stock on bigger deals. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. With the on-site, you've had tremendous growth over the past few seasons. What further opportunity do you see at the North America amphitheaters? And then just beyond that, what's the opportunity to take those best practices from the amps to the festivals and then maybe to the clubs and theaters as well? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. This is Joe, David. As we said, we're at about $27 per fan right now. When we benchmark the sports fees, they're in the 30s, so we think there continues to be good opportunity for continued growth over the next several years by further honing the offer, the VIP offer, all of the other ancillary services that we have. So we're very optimistic. We think the organizational change we put in place at the end of last year to get more focus on execution to the amps has helped a lot this year and the continued growth there. So we think there's quite a bit more to continue to move. And absolutely we are taking learnings that we're getting here. We've brought them into the theatre and club business particularly in North America already, very focused on the VIP offerings there, focused on our beverage service, what we have, our points of sale, our mix and so on. And I think festivals are more individualized given the thematic of the festival, but absolutely starting to roll some of that out there, too. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just regarding your commentary for concerts in Q4, I think you mentioned North America would be strong but measured against international tough comp. And then is there any way you can sort of frame your outlook for concerts in the aggregate for Q4? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. Nothing more than we've already given. David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. So two questions. First, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about your acquisition pipeline. It looks like you acquired an asset in Brazil this quarter. Are there any other geographic markets that you're focused on either on the Events or Ticketing side? And my second question is there's been a lot of questions I think from investors on the upcoming FTC workshop in Ticketing, can you just talk through some of the details around this, whatever you're willing to share either the process or some of the issues that they're depressing on? Thank you. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Amy. We continue as we have historically. We think there are lots of great bolt-on acquisitions that are generally accretive as we're buying them. We're in over 40 countries now. So we look at building on where we already have a business. So in those 40 countries, we're always looking for ongoing festivals or established promoters or music venues that can build on our business and grow our core business. So we kind of look at it on a global basis and have a running acquisition list of things we're exploring. I'd say all of \u2013 there's no one country that's more important than the other, we see growth in all of it. U.S. as you've all seen, the last few years has been growing and we think the U.S. has lots of growth left. We have a lot of markets where we're underdeveloped still in cities, Miami and Florida, Los Angeles, Denver, Seattle, we have a lot of markets where we can still grow our business. Canada is a big opportunity, Australia, South America, as you've seen us move over the last few years. So what we love about this business is actually the global opportunity on a bolt-on strategy with really no regulations on a local basis. So it allows us to move into these countries like Argentina and Brazil and Milan and in Cape Town. And if there's a great international promoter or a festival, we can instantly buy that and build it into our global platform and power accretively instantly. So what we \u2013 we have a long list of businesses we look at across the globe and we think that will keep \u2013 you'll keep hearing about an ongoing story of the bolt-on to keep building our business. Joe will fill you in on the TM. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes. Yeah. So Amy, on the FTC workshop, just to be clear, the FTC in our conversations with them have told us this workshop has been long in the works, well predates any of that press cycles that existed around various assertions that as we've answered with the Senate and elsewhere were largely misleading about. But the FTC workshop, to our understanding, is going to focus on a wide variety of practices in ticketing, it's going to focus on speculative ticket sales, which is basically ticket sales where the ticker doesn't actually exist. It's going to focus on fraudulent advertising and the use of misleading websites. It's going to focus on the use of bots, all three of which, to be clear, Ticketmaster doesn't participate in. We're the only major secondary site that doesn't do spec selling, doesn't \u2013 we certainly don't use fraudulent advertising and our policy is not to allow bots \u2013 is first to try stop bots and secondly, to not let people who use bots post their tickets. So we think there's going to be a whole host of topics and we're going to fully participate. We applaud the fact that the workshop is taking place and we think that there'll be a lot more transparency and accurate information coming out of it. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on Presence. So Q4 10 million fans expected to enter $5 million on mobile. What's, I guess, the barrier there to getting that $5 million up to a higher number at some point? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Is the question barrier or... Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, it's not \u2013 this is Joe. It's not really \u2013 the reason why it's $5 million versus $10 million is the decision by teams whether or not paper tickets for season ticket holders are also issued in addition to the use of the mobile tickets. There are some teams that have already switched to mobile only with the exception of people that have indicated an issue, that's what we talked about up to 97% of the people entering a game on a mobile ticket. So it's our expectation that as teams get more comfortable with the technology, they see it working, they see other teams that are the leaders able to get 97% plus in without any issues, we'll have more and more teams adopting the use of all mobile. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. And then I guess following up on \u2013 I'm bringing this question on pricing. Are you seeing kind of pricing across the board with all artists, so everyone taking a little bit more pricing equally, or are there a couple of artists that are kind of pricing much closer to market value and then you've got a kind of a pool of artists you need to go back and address in the future? Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, it's across the board. There would be \u2013 generally, every artist is probably underpricing this product, might just be the one front row or it might be the first 17 rows depending how big you're for an arena or a stadium. But generally, artists underprice their product and all have opportunity to increase their pricing. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then I guess back to the digital ticketing, as you \u2013 as your data kind of improves on who's coming to the shows and their behavior there, when you think about sponsorship and advertising, the 70 partners that drive 75% of the revenue, how has that changed? Do you think you have room for more partners that drive a big chunk like that, or is it those 70s and even more? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think it's both. I think those 70 absolutely have already shown their commitment to music and to our business reaching these millennial fans. And when they can get an even tighter connection they will absolutely be spending more because they'll be getting the results from their sponsorship. And there continue to be a number of categories and markets where we have sponsorship opportunities, and I think this just makes our product all the more attractive in general for all of those potential sponsors. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And I'm just going to jump on that. The core of the digital ticket unlocks multiple revenue avenues for us as well as just a better way to do business. Right now, as we've talked about, we have 16,000 barcodes that walked in the arena. I don't know who those barcodes generally are, if they've changed hands. In the future, we're going to have 16 (32:04) digital tickets walk in that building that are scanned. So, we're going know who those 16,000 people \u2013 we're going to have a one-on-one dialogue with them. So yes, our data increases tremendously on knowing all about the customers that go to our shows, so that's obviously very valuable for sponsors. But two, we also get to talk to the fans at the show. It really opens up the how do you correspond with these 16,000 people that walked in a concert. Do you upsell them when they're walking, do you know what seats they're in, are they getting a beer or are they buying a T-shirt? So you really bring to life those 90 million customers that go to a Live Nation show we talk about that generally we haven't been able to actually sell once they walk in the door. We're good at getting them to the door. We're good at talking to them weeks before the show. We haven't had any technology to-date that lets us talk to them while they're at the most important place : the show, the festival, the pre-show, the after show. So we get to talk to them while they're at the show, provides incredible revenue opportunities. Also, just you're at a country show, we can talk to you about \u2013 do you want to go next Friday, we have tickets available for another show. So the dialogue that we get to create with this engaged customer base when a digital ticket turns a barcode into a customer both before the show and at the show provides incredible opportunities for our Concert division and our Sponsorship division. Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question will come from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Joyce - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Could you please talk about the Ticketmaster margins? I know you've already guided to similar margins to last year and also in the past you've talked about obviously managing to cash flow growth instead of the margins themselves, but could you please discuss what the impacts are on the margins from the mix of international ticketing businesses which are typically lower, and from the investment level on continually redeveloping Ticketmaster? Just help us think about what the impacts are there and why the impact of higher volumes are not resulting in higher margins. Thank you. Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, David, just again just to make sure we frame this, year-to-date, our revenue is up 13% and our AOI is up 11%. And I indicated that for the full year, our margins are expected to be flat. So that's the overall context of it. It's a very stable business, and yes, we continue to make substantial investments in areas like digital ticketing which is, as Michael just went through, for a lot of reasons massive change in the Ticketing business that'll have a dramatic benefit on Concerts side of the business, on our Sponsorship side of the business, so that flows through elsewhere. So part of it is divisional accounting may track costs in one area and benefits in another on some levels. But it is also, yes, our investments on ticketing throughout the world. International ticketing continues to grow well which, as we've talked about, is generally a lower margin. We're continuing to focus and invest in our theaters and clubs, do-it-yourself business where we have 25,000 shows, 25 million fans a year which we think is very important to continue to develop high-quality tools for the artists. And those tend to be lower margin tickets due to their general simplicity relative to what exists at the arena, amphitheater or stadium level. So we'll continue to grow the business across all fronts, and I think continue to deliver strong AOI growth against that. David Joyce - Evercore ISI : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Please go ahead. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks. Just continuing on the margin theme, I mean, on the flip side, the really impressive margin improvement in the huge Concerts segment, and I know you've talked about the pricing in the house and the revenue per attendee going up, scheduling improvements, but what's sort of driving that overall and how much more progress can you make on margins in the Concerts segment? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hey Doug, this is Joe. I think you gave the two big drivers which is we continue to grow the high margin food and beverage, ancillaries per fan, that flows through very well. And then secondly, pricing inherently flows through very well also. So those are the two biggest drivers. For all the reasons that we talked about before not being margin obsessed, I don't think we're focused on what exactly can that be because we'll continue to grow our business in stadiums and arenas and other buildings that may be more traditional margins as opposed to our buildings which will be higher margins. We'll have different mix year-to-year. We thought this year is a heavier amphitheater mix. We've also got arena growth so those fluctuations and the fact that we are overall just focused and obsessed on growing the business and growing profitably means that we're not going to be as determined as we think about that margin number. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Well, you had cited earlier in the year that the big stadium show mix would be not as great in this year's third quarter, I think you've cited in this release... Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : ...specifically internationally. Does that does help your margins when that's true? Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well on a relative basis, your amphitheaters are going to because of your average per fan revenue you get from the onsite, it's going to be your highest margin customer, if you will. So in a year we've got relatively more amphitheaters than, yes, that's going to help your margin. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Right. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: But Doug, we've always talked \u2013 we're growing our business \u2013 it's more important on our scale flywheel to grow than for me just to select amphitheater shows that are higher margin and at the expense of stadiums or other shows, right? So we know that if we get 90 million customers in our flywheel on a positive basis that we can sell them more food, we can sell them more sponsors, we can sell them more ticketing services, all the other higher margin businesses than the low margin flywheel. So our first goal is we will continue to grow the global market share of the Live business which we still have great opportunities in, with that then we'll also be able to grow across our businesses that we scale from that flywheel. Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC : Got it. Got it. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further telephone questions at this time. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to today's speakers. Please go ahead. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call. I will make my comments today excluding the 2017 impacts of the $110 million legal settlement to keep our year-over-year comparable. Live Nation delivered its eighth consecutive year of record results. Revenue was up 11%, AOI up 13% and free cash flow up 8%. All our divisions concert sponsors and ticketing delivered their strongest AOI results in the history of the Company. Turning with our concert units. Fans more than ever find the large experience from club shows arenas to, a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artist and show the experience with fans. In the U.S. alone, over the past 10 years, consumer spend on live experiences has grown by $5 billion per year, and we believe this ongoing trend will structurally continue to drive increased demand for concerts globally. As a result to the strong demand growth in 2018 we delivered double digit attendance growth across our arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs. Continuing to grow our global market share, adding nearly 7 million fans globally for total 93 million fans, driving concert revenue up 11% and AOI up 22%. Across all of the artists we work with, we invested over $6 billion to promote 35,000 shows in 40 countries with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artist and music. In addition to growing our show count and attendance, our pricing and onsite initiatives also continue to grow our AOI. Average ticket prices for our amphitheaters and arena shows increased by 13% in 2018 as part of the house pricing was up over 20%. Overall, across all our shows, price increases delivered over $350 million to artist who effectively captured more the value from shows. Once at the show average per fan spend grew as well, our amphitheaters spent grew by $3 to $27 per head as we added more high-end products, improve the quality of our food and beverage, and increase the revenue we earned from parking and service fees. The strength of our business is continuing to 2019 with ticket sales for shows this year up double-digits through mid-February, along with similar increases and confirmed amphitheater, arena and stadium show count. With this growth and our plans to further monetize our fan relationship, I expect this to translate to continued strong growth at concerts with AOI in 2019. In our high-end sponsorship business, we grew both revenue and AOI by 13% in 2018. Our top strategic sponsors have been a key driver of this growth with 75 sponsors collectively spending over 350 million to reach our fans up 11% over 2017. Sponsorship at our festivals grew 13%. This growth was driven by new deals with brands including Heineken, Barclays, State Farm and Frito-Lay. All of this reinforces the power of our platform of 93 million fans, and the continued shift by brands to invest in reaching fans during the live experience. Research from our Power of Live white paper indicates that over 90% of fans believe that brands can enhance the live experience and over 60% of fans believe they are more likely to connect with brands at concerts. This reinforces that our shows offer brands a truly unique opportunity to connect with fans. With over 70% of our budgeted sponsorship net revenue for the year already committed, pacing double-digits ahead of this time last year, we are confident we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth in 2019. Ticketmaster continued growing its leadership position in ticketing in 2018, with fee-bearing GTV up 14% and total platform GTV up 33 billion. This drove a 14% increase in ticketing revenue and AOI of 7%. Our top priority at Ticketmaster in 2018 was deploying our TM presence product, which we see as our key for effectively unlocking the value of our customer relationships across our ticketing, concerts and sponsorship businesses. By the end of 2018, we deployed presence in over 200 venues, operating 20,000 events for 40 million fans, approximately half of whom used digital tickets. We see our deployment in 2019 further accelerating, and we are expecting to have presence in over 500 venues by the end of the year, with over 125 million fans attending events at these buildings. At that point, we will cover over 75% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, making Ticketmaster by far the global leader in digital ticketing. At the same time, we continue build our marketplace, with the fourth quarter being our highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, selling over 60 million fee-bearing tickets in a quarter for the first time, and delivering over $5 billion in fee-bearing GTV. Overall in 2018, Ticketmaster managed over 400,000 events, delivering almost 500 million tickets in 28 countries. We continue adding new clients to our marketplace, who collectively added over 10 million new tickets in 2018. I believe we have tremendous opportunity for growth on a global basis, particularly in the 13 markets where we promote concerts but do not yet have a substantial ticketing operation. In 2018, we furthered our international expansion, establishing ticketing operations in Italy, ramping up our German operations and laying the groundwork for expansion in Latin America. Ticketmaster continues to exceed expectations, both operationally and in its leadership position in digital ticketing, along with its ability to expand that leadership position globally and deliver continued profitable growth. In summary, 2018 was another strong year for Live Nation, building our global concert business and thereby driving growth in our high margin venues, sponsorship and ticketing businesses. We continue to see the tremendous power of live events with strong consumer demand, the robust supply of new and established artists hitting the road and clubs, and stadium. Live is truly a unique entertainment firm, it cannot be duplicated and create lifetime memories, the fans are creating more than ever this experience economy. We believe the live business will continue to have strong growth for years to come as fans globally drive demand artists of touring more and more an onsite spending sponsors and ticketing all benefit from the concerts flywheel. In 2019, I expect it to further grow our global concert position while enhancing onsite hospitality and capturing more pricing opportunities. In sponsorship, we will continue to drive double digit growth is more brands look for that direct connection with music fans. And ticketing continue to transform to a truly digital ecosystem, it will benefit from continued growth in concert ticket sales and further expansion of our global footprint. We believe that the combination of macro trends and our demonstrated ability to execute are strong indicators of our ability to continue to grow the business for many years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first concerts as Michael said, in 2018, we grew attendance by 8% to a record 93 million fans promoting 19 of the top 25 global tours. As we have talked about over the past year, 2018 was a very strong year for arenas and theaters in theaters and clubs with all three building types of double digits in attendance. Globally, we also continue growing our festival portfolio, adding seven festivals to give us a global portfolio of 104 festivals in 14 countries. As a result we increase festival attendees by 6% to nearly 9 million fans and now have 29 festivals that each attracted over 100,000 fans last year. Looking geographically, North America was the primary driver of our fan growth while internationally to stick with lower stadium attendance offset much of their strong arena and festival attendance growth. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter attendance and show count were up our AOI was lower, heavily driven by a $15 million a year on year increase in advertising expense related to 2019 shows. This increased advertising spend representative of a continued shift earlier on sales and is also one of the reasons we are optimistic about 2019 concert activity. For 2019, as Michael said we are already seen strong growth and ticket sales for shows this year. Sales are particularly strong in our international markets, which we expect to continue through the year with North America also expected to keep growing. We see growth across all buildings types in 2019 with arenas globally amphitheaters and North American and stadiums internationally, all contributing to the increase. Along with our fan growth, we will also be continuing our focus on pricing optimization and onsite monetization in 2019. On pricing, with over 2000 arena and amphitheater shows already on sale, we are seeing high single digit increases in front of house pricing, which I expect to continue to expand throughout the year. While on site monetization won't start until the summer season, it remains a priority to continue our growth of the past few years with teams already working on specific amphitheater by amphitheater plans. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. In 2018, we again delivered double digit AOI growth, up 13% this year. This performance was reflective of strength across the board. North America and international sponsorship businesses were both up double-digits, and both sponsorship and online advertising also grew double-digits. For the fourth quarter, revenue was a 20% and AOI was at 16%. We saw particularly strong growth in our festivals in the fourth quarter including Austin City Limits and Voodoo while also launching a number of major programs for sponsors including Google, Sony, Pepsi Uber and T Mobile. As we get into 2019, we expect to again deliver double-digit AOI growth of the year. As Michael indicated, we are pacing double-digits ahead of this time last year, and based on our current discussions with brands, we are expecting strong growth in our basis strategic sponsors as well as our on-site sponsorship particularly at festivals. Finally, Ticketmaster. Global GTV was up 7% for the quarter and up 8% for the full year, driven by Fee-Bearing GTV, which was up 12% and 14% for the quarter and year respectively. Primary GTV, which accounts for almost 90% of overall Fee-Bearing GTV was up 12% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Secondary GTV was up 6% for the quarter and up 16% for the full year. As we continue to take share in the North America secondary market. Throughout 2018, we continue to improve our mobile and app experiences, which is critical for our digital strategy. We grow our app install base by 40% year-over-year give me this much greater reach for direct can relationships. In sales of tickets via mobile devices continue to grow rapidly, up 35% for the year and accounting for over 40% of overall ticket sales. For the fourth quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was down slightly impacted by one-time costs associated with the third-party vendor data breach that affected our marketplace in certain international markets. Much of these costs were in the fourth quarter and for the full year these one-time cost totaled approximately $15 million. To preempt the question on margins, obviously, these data breach costs at a material impact on our 2018 margins. The majority of the remaining margin impact comes from two other factors. First, as Michael indicated, we're continuing to invest and expanding Ticketmaster's global footprint and we expect in any start-up market will have below average margins for a period of time as it scales. These markets are generally rapidly AOI positive given our ability to get an allocation applied nation concert tickets, but initially at below average margins. Secondly, as we continue to get more effective a data driven marketing, we're spending more to grow our GTV. To be clear, the GTV from free visits continued growing in 2018. The paid marketing driven GTV grew even faster. As a result, margins were impacted despite the attractive profitability of the incremental GTV generated via this paid marketing. So in summary, 2018 was a great year across all of our businesses; and in 2019, we expect to continue growing all the businesses. From a stadium standpoint, we see our growth continuing to be delivered primarily in the second, third quarters, as most of our concert investments will be playing out in those quarters. The first and fourth quarters each account for less than 10% of our annual AOI, meaning that they will also have to absorb increase fixed costs associated with our overall growth against seasonally lower activity. On FX, we ended up with a negligible impact on AOI and revenue for 2018 and at this point we see very little impact on 2019. I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard : Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon everyone. I will start with our key highlights for the fourth quarter. Revenue increased by 12% to $2.6 billion, AOI was $69 million compared to $87 million in 2017, after adding back in $110 million legal accrual recorded in 2017. As of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.1 billion, up 35% from the $816 million last year. Concerts with a 12% increase contributed the majority of the revenue growth in the quarter from increased arena and theater and club activity. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 20% from higher sponsor and online activity in North America, and ticketing revenue increase 15% from higher primary ticket volume. Fourth quarter AOI was lower in concerts due to the $15 million increase in advertising expense for 2019 shows that Joe mentioned. Sponsorship and advertising delivered 16% growth in an AOI with higher online advertising in North America and growth in sponsorships internationally. Our operating loss was $90 million in the quarter, essentially flat to last year after adjusting for the legal accrual. The net loss for the quarter was $148 million compared to a loss of $137 million in the prior year, before the legal accrual and $56 million tax benefits related to tax reform changes in 2017. For the 2018 school year revenue was $10.8 billion an 11% increase over 2017.AOI was $829 million for the full year, and up 13% over our 2017 AOI $735 million before the legal accrual. Free cash flow Jessica was $481 million up 8% over last year without the legal accrual, or 58% of AOI for the year. Other segments delivered double digit growth in revenue for 2018. The majority of the increase was driven by concerts up, 11% from increase show account and attendance across arenas, amphitheaters in theaters and clubs. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 13% from growth in online advertising and sponsorship programs globally. And ticketing revenue increased by 14% from higher primary ticket volume driven by concerts along with increased secondary sales. Concerts AOI was up 22% as a result of more events and fans, across arenas, amphitheaters festivals in theaters and clubs and higher ancillary revenue per fan and or amphitheaters, Sponsorship and advertising AOI grew by 13% in line with this higher revenue and ticketing AOI grew 7% without the 2017 legal accrual, delivering growth in both primary and secondary ticket sales. Although impacted by the cyber investigation costs incurred this year that Joe noted. Operating income was $273 million, up 35% over last year before the legal accrual driven by our strong AOI growth. Our net income for the year was $60 million as compared to $48 million in 2017 before the legal accrual and the 2017 tax reform related tax benefit. We recorded $78 million of accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest in 2018. We currently expect this accretion to be approximately $45 million for 2019 which will be consistently spread across the quarters. We expected amortization of non-repeatable ticketing contract advances in 2019 will be in line with the last few years of expense. Turning to our balance sheet. As of December, we had total cash of $2.4 billion, including 859 million and ticketing client cash, and 903 million in net concert event related cash. Leading free cash balances $610 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was 942 million as compared to 624 million last year with the increased driven by our higher event related deferred revenue. For the full year, total capital expenditures were $251 million, roughly half of which were spent on revenue generating items. For 2019, we currently expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $300 million, with a similar split to this year for revenue generating expenditures. Our total net debt as of December 2018 was $2.8 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.2%. Thank you for joining us today and we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong : So I guess two questions. One, one for Joe first, when you talk about ticketing and expanding into international markets. How quickly do you think the margins on those fronts can match that on the U.S. side? And I guess, Michael, a lot of us remember from the Liberty Analysts Day, hitting -- the Live Nation hitting a 125 million attendees. What does that assume in terms of M&A and organic growth? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Amy thanks. So here with regard to the international market. So the first thing remember on the international market is currently the fee structure is fairly different on average in the U.S. Your typical service fee in the U.S. is around 20%. Your typical service fee internationally is around 10%. So we talked in the past that one of the factors that we have going on as we reviewing thought our international markets. Again profitable market adding to our AOI and cash generation, they\u2019re structurally today at a lower margin on average than the U.S. market. And while we see some level of convergence overtime, don't expect that to shift quickly. Each of the markets in terms of its maturation all has, hard to give you a one size fits all. But as I said, they do become AOI positive pretty quickly with our concert allocations and then we grow it from there. Michael Rapino : Amy, it's Michael, I'll jumping on TM. The one thing to think about also on ticketing outside of North America, it's probably, let's call it 15 years behind the U.S. model was so advanced on a closed platform and just increasing service fees every dollar for 20 years. International, we see great growth in that, some of those markets may only have $2 service fees today, but they all have great pricing potential for the next 10 years. So a lot of these markets today are lower so to speak, there they literally are still distributing over the local bank and we have a retail strategy converting to online. But we also see international has a great opportunity to that is where we actually have great pricing power. And every year we're seeing the service fee going up to reflect kind of closer to the U.S. model overtime. So great profit pool to grow internationally outside the U.S. Canada. And Amy starting second question and Michael can chip in. The question that has grown 125 million fans from our 93 million fans M&A versus organic. The complexity here again with us is we will often use M&A to enter a market buying local to be relatively small, promoter one who's well established that market. And then we can on our engine of 80 tours that we're buying on to that area. So whether we're talking about a local market here in North America or promoter down in Argentina, we rapidly grow organically off of that initial platform that we're purchasing. So we end up with 70% 80% organic growth as a result, but we but we do use absolute M&A for that initial entry point. Yes actually let me took the words out. I mean, we historically have had a fairly balanced model, well over 30 of our business to be acquiring more tourists globally and three markets on our own and growing the overall business by showing more tickets to the current tour, and then we selectively on bolt-on still look at the global opportunity of a fragmented industry. I think we use that 30% global market share. So we'll continue to bolt on, there's a few chunk here ones we would look to acquire to Excel that and organic. And those three combinations are how we grew over the last five, six years and we think will continue to execute both runway on bolt on and an organic. Operator : And we'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet : A quick question on the secondary ticketing market. You mentioned you're gaining share. Do you mind just giving us a quick snapshot of sort of how big that market is and major players are? And how your how you think you're being successful taking share so far? Joe Berchtold : Yes. So, we're getting some pretty specific numbers that are last Liberty presentation. So I'll try to remember all of those numbers. So, I think what we did say is the secondary industry over the past several years has been growing at a pretty good clip, frankly, faster than we have been growing our ticket prices. And so we think there continues to be over $1 billion price arbitrage that exists in our concert tickets alone. And if you look at the marketplace, we obviously have a two headed strategy. One strategy is to create a compelling product on Ticketmaster that offers but the primary. And secondary tickets, the other strategy which is at least as important is to continue to get more effective at that initial primary ticket pricing and transfer as much of the economics as possible into the artists pocket which can use to track down to tour more and be out there generating more sales more bands for our overall flywheel strategies. So going forward, I think it would be our expectation that we would see rest growth certainly in the secondary market as we continue to focus on that primary prices, I think that the competitors in the space are pretty well known, obviously stuff in the United States. But, for us it's really a matter of how do we continue to best serve dollars and the fans for the right products. Operator : And we'll go next to Brandon Ross with BTIG. Brandon Ross : Maybe following up on, Amy, a little bit, you did a number of international acquisition since Q4 started, I think 9. And you mentioned strengths next year being driven by international. Are we now at a point where you see international becoming the real growth engine of the Company? And maybe you could talk about what markets you're investing in internationally and why? And then I have a follow up. Michael Rapino : I'll start and Joe can fill in some pieces. I don't think we've done anything that we haven't been actually done for a while. We still believe that the U.S. Canadian market, let's put those two together. still have growth ahead. We are still under servicing in markets as we've talked before about. We serve a lot of opportunities to build one of our businesses and a lot of in the A market. We have low market share in a lot of big market. So U.S. still has great potential, we still think sponsorship is a double-digit growth business in America. And we see, I think the concert business continues to be on-site hospitality, real estate expansion and incredible frothy opportunity in the U.S. So it's not an easier either. We continue to execute with great confidence that it's you can invest in America. But we absolutely have always said that it's a global business and as we build out the pipe in 40 countries, and we look at all the other cities around the world where we have no market share or learn. As we put in the best promoter in a ticketing platform and our global concert which then follow usually sponsorship in ticketing, we have that model down in major cities and when we got those 3 to 4 legs of that still in Milan and Cape Town and real, we know we can build $10 million to $20 million business. So we think our whole bunch of opportunities international where we don't have the four legs we might have one leg, that's why you see us by a festival in a major market and major promoter in a different market. As we fill up the legs, great opportunity organically will happen to our scale. So we'll be doing that for the next 5 to 10 years. We'll be talking about 30% market share and lots of opportunity to build International Business platform. It's behind America and a lot of the ways I just mentioned on ticketing. So, we see it probably as a higher growth potential from unsophisticated in both sponsorship ticketing and venue development. So all 3 of those, you'll see our opportunities over the years called about the apparatus we want to get built to consistent demand that we know is we had a console anywhere and that's the part to makes our model unique. So continue to grow international that'll be a great start for us, for many years to come with diverse enough now, but the certain market is having a good or bad day will be okay and have enough risk aversion. And the U.S. will continue to have a deeper bench to grow on ourselves. Brandon Ross : And then I was wondering if you can take us through your current real estate strategy. You have per cap of significantly over the past few years and the Company is gotten bigger with more balance sheet capacity. With that in mind, do you expect to accelerate the growth of over no venues over the coming years? Michael Rapino : Yes. I think I would frame it slightly different than -- I really don't recall all five of your questions Brandon is that the -- Joe Berchtold : You only get 2 out of 6. Brandon Ross : Some housekeeping if you like. Michael Rapino : No that's fine. No, it's a valid point. We absolutely see a huge opportunity. If you look at our core business model, I'm sure people are sick of the phrase and I do appreciate the book you enrich of let me patent from flywheel long before any other businesses nailed that one. So, yes, we have a big flywheel of concerts and we're going to wake up every year, finding new adjacent businesses that we can monetize because of the flywheel. And no one in the world has 30,000 shows and 100 million people walking in the door. So that's why we believe in the U.S. and onward with its endless growth opportunities. One of them happens to be the venue, the real estate. For many years, we were happy to putting our content in someone else's venue and getting a ticket free and inserting ticket to the door. A lot of the times as we've said in our in our different analysts meetings, when the content ends up in my amphitheater or my festival, or my theater and club, we even make more money because we're now counting more revenue streams. And we look now at the real estate market in America, the advantage we have is there's way more real estate to their artists. And if you are a developer right now, with a shopping mall to a development site, you no longer are probably asking the movie theater to be your tenant you probably come in a Live Nation saying, I'd love to build a 2,000 seat or 4,000seat to 6,000 seat. I'd love to be part of our development because that's the vibrant part of the experience we're creating. So what we're doing now is when those meetings happen and say we're not happy just to ticket until you're building, we want to have equity value in that position and operate and run it to maximize all of the value that can be created from our $6 million a year. So instead of maybe paying somebody millions a year to reach their building to run it while we fill it, there are times we're going to look at hero strategies and real estate where our content is the entire reason the building is being financed for the building is growing in value. We should capture not just the content, not just the food and beverage, but the equity value of the real estate holdings overtime too. So, we're seeing more and more opportunities where our flywheel is putting us in a position to do have some equity ownership and control and some great assets that are completely down the middle completely down the line of a concert live venue. And you'll see us explore more of being more leverage in our content. Brandon Ross : Okay, just for you. I'm going have to ask a quick short term one. As far as more date quite well at the box, should we expect this to contribute in 2019 is as you recognized downstream revenues from that sale? Michael Rapino : Well, it will be our first time with movie accounting. So, we\u2019ll see what audits look like, but I would say in just in general, we are thrilled with this division. It's another I just mentioned it earlier, we have scale, we have artist relationships, great stories to be told. So, we started a new division organically. I think we've done five now we've probably got 10 to 15 projects in the pipeline of artists are telling great live stories or movies or documentaries or festival stories or et cetera. So we think that's division is obviously a much higher margin business from the conscious space. It's a low capital intensive business but ultimately is a great marketing platform for artists our shows and Artist Nation division. So we think, we're not really working 2019, it will be a small overall contribution to our agenda in AOI. Overtime, I think it's a like Artist Nation, we think it's a nice high margin ancillary business to our core mission that will be a positive impact. But ultimately, we\u2019ll make AOI to be positive much like we learned with Artist Nation and others, they also end up feeding mother ships. So, Artist Nation, star is born is probably the single greatest marketing exercise we could have did for our sponsorship division. If you are in that division, those kind of things just really setting the flywheel very high and get you in the CMO meeting and other conversations that you hadn't been before. So, we're looking at the pieces always in the end of ancillary business, get us one more tour, one more sponsor or one more ticketing contract and make high margins AOI, it\u2019s a triple win. Operator : We'll go next to David Karnovsky with JP Morgan. David Karnovsky : Just on ticketing, in the release you\u2019ve mentioned growth drivers is concert sales and expansion of a global footprint. I was wondering, if you can provide any commentary on the sport side and how you do that contributing in 2019? Michael Rapino : Sure, I mean, the sport side is obviously key historical foundation to the ticketing business. As we talk sports is also on friendly more static level. There aren't -- there's not a lot of growth in terms of the number of teams or number of games played in the season for the major sports. So, it's really been the concerts business that is driven great growth over the past several years of ticketing. Again, we've given this statistic several times around 80 percentage of fee-bearing GTV growth coming from the concert business. So, it's critical on the support side as they built incredible arenas or stadiums. They're looking to continue to sell those buildings every night, just not just when the games are playing. Those provide platforms for the tours, the artists that we work with, they continue to put on more shows. And it's putting on those more shows that we've been able to grow the business. So, it's not the sports directly, it's the sports indirectly, that's been unlock have a lot of Ticketmaster's growth. David Karnovsky : And then just on the leading indicators, I think in event deferred revenues up 35%, though you did mention early on sales this year. Just wondering, how to think about that number maybe on a like-for-like basis assuming more consistent on sale periods? Michael Rapino : I mean, that's the challenge. You can't assume consistent on sale because there's no exactness to that. We said that we're up double-digits in terms of concert events and tickets sold through mid-February. So that to us is the key leading indicator that we're off to a good start for this year. Operator : We'll go next to Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs. Drew Borst : I want to ask about Ticketmaster presence and see, if you'd be willing to put some parameters around. What type of contribution to AOI could come from presence over 2019? Or maybe even, what kind of contribution it provided in the fourth quarter as you scale that business? Michael Rapino : The economics for us of presence versus other systems, digital tickets versus paper tickets is the same economics for us. So, it's not going to be a direct impact on the AOI. Ultimately, what it is by increasing the volume of data, the quality of data that we have on every fan and then on their behavior, the increased ability to reach out on target, interact with those fans while they're on site because of that digital connection will unlock our sponsorship and the value of those 93 million fans that we have for the brands. And we will unlock our ability to better market, create products, and ultimately convert those fans into additional purchases. So, it's not directly the presence rollout itself. Drew Borst : Okay. And then as a follow up, yes, I noticed that a recent announcement of SMG, which is a big venue operator their form a joint venture with AEG. I was wondering if you could just talk about whether that was sort of impact that may or may not have on your business> I think if I'm not mistaken, SMG is it to the Ticketmaster customer right now, but maybe you can just talk about it, if it has any impact and then maybe broader strategically what it means? Michael Rapino : Yes, it has no impact on our day-to-day business. We're not facing in the conference center management business it's a scale venue management business, that's not what we do. But between the two of them the building that they do have, we have an existing Ticketmaster contract with SMG. We feel they\u2019re buildings the ones that are Manchester et cetera. And we received a call the minute that was a public announcement from them to reassure us to fill the buildings and ticketing their businesses a huge strategic imperative of theirs. And we've always looked at AEG facilities, our SMG as partners. They all need us to put more shows and fill those venues that they're managing. And they have all probably experiment elsewhere and ended up realizing Ticketmaster also happens to sell them the most tickets. They're managing those buildings for someone else generally. That someone else doesn't care about competition they care about results. So the reason we're the largest supplier the AEG's facility business or SMG or others just because it's good business for both of us. So they're not a business to run will continue to be a good supplier to them. And in return I would assume a ticketing partner forward. So no effect from us, continue to think that we'll grow our business equally well. And we've been growing it in both of those companies over the last five years. Operator : We'll go next to David Joyce with Evercore. David Joyce : A question on the venue types and the volume of shows, there was an impact on the fourth quarter and having fewer stadium events. How should think about it this year in terms of size of venues and what that should do for margins on the concert side, and if you could have any visibility on that impact quarterly? And then secondarily on Rock and Rio, just wanted to think about how that will impact you financially this year. I now it bridges two quarters later in the year and what are your thoughts on expanding that again, as that festival has done in the past? Michael Rapino : So, I'll take the three or four part venue question, David. So one of the things we said is that growth this year is expected, and amphitheaters in North America and the arenas globally and stadiums internationally. Last year, we grew our amphitheaters in North America and you saw, if you want to talk about margin benefiting concert simply because you have all of those food and beverage and other ancillary per fan revenue streams directly associated with our amphitheater business as we talked about that's the most profitable and when we can monetize them, and all those rates in our own buildings. So that helps the overall margin if you will, I don't, because as we told you many times in the past, but we don't obsess on margin. We obsess on growing the AOI, I couldn't tell you the exact margin ramifications certainly not by quarter. But I can tell you that I do expect us to benefit and continue to grow in AOI ff the amphitheaters and their continued growth. And that's largely in Q2 and Q3 period. And then you'll see the same with festivals as we continue to grow our festival business. Again, benefiting from those attractive on side standing against Q2, Q3, so a lot of the benefits from the concert growth will continue to see all primarily in the second, third quarters. David Joyce : And then on the Rock in Rio, how that should impact you this year and do you have plans yet for how you would be alternating and other markets like Las Vegas or Portugal residents been done before? Kathy Willard : So on Rock in Rio, I think it was outlined in the 8-K pretty clearly. But we do not consolidate that at this point. So it's equity earnings when the event happens. Michael Rapino : And there aren't, again the plans that are out there have been announced, they're the events in Brisbane. No other event has been announced at this point. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Ryan Sundby : Michael, you talk about adding more stores to international markets. I guess in the 13 markets where you promote shows that don't have ticking operations yet. Is there a common kind of barrier that exists that that keeps you out of those? Michael Rapino : No, no. It's just been in our resources time execution. We have a prioritized list and the first 3 or 4 years that we bought Ticketmaster, we had 14 platforms. So, a lot of what, we\u2019re just getting all of our backend enterprise platform rebuilt. So, we could move into new markets was a common platform just adjusted for currency and taxes and retail. So, we have a robust platform now and we're just rolling out market-by-market in our prioritize list. It's just people, energy and time to get it done no companies exists with the, we have a big enough market share on a global basis that would inhibit it. They\u2019re usually local operators or local ticketing companies, they may have a leadership position, but our content usually lets us come in with a strong position. So, what is they\u2019ll able to see us adding market-by-market and are building within the markets were in brick by brick over the next few years. Ryan Sundby : And then on presence, how micro can you go with that? Is the 500 venues and 75% major sports in 5 buildings? Is that a big chunk of it or are you pushing this down to the club level over that couple of years? So just curious how far you can go with that? Michael Rapino : Absolutely, we foresee this becoming the standard of our access control entry and how it is we distribute and manage tickets. So, the focus is getting the large ones first which stand drives Paul, the Ticketmaster for the adoption as opposed to be out there trying to push it everywhere, but starting with Live Nation from amphitheaters to clubs and theaters. And they're major sports team and then going in wildest possible from there. It's a same thing as Michael just saying, it's just matter of prioritization execution to get done all of them. Operator : And we'll go next to Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Doug Arthur : Just understand the fourth quarter a little bit better. Kathy, you had 15 million step up in marketing which you've highlighted in the third quarter. And the bulk of the 15 million on the data breach was in the fourth quarter. So is that a fair way to look at it? And then, are we done on these? Or is the marketing going to continue for a while? Kathy Willard : So, yes, it\u2019s a fair way to look at on the fourth quarter, but I mean we market every show, right. So, the normal accounting for show accounting is that the advertising expense is the expense when the show happens expect at year-end, that we have to expense anything that's on the balance sheet for future shows. So, you're always going to have that effect every fourth quarter just like we have. Michael Rapino : And, Doug, that's a good think. Like you want that number to be high, which we don't spend marketing unless we have the show. So, the good news is that you look at that number and say than they have a lot of show went on sale that will monetize in '19. So which is an accounting we have to actually true it up at the end of the year. Kathy Willard : And then on the investigation, cost investigation continues, that we would expect to have some level of expenses in 2019. We just haven\u2019t given you specifics on that. Doug Arthur : Okay. Michael Rapino : Don\u2019t expect it to be somewhat less than the $15 million at this point in the millions, but it will still continue and won't be material on the similar things. End of Q& A Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions at this time. So I'm turning the call back over to our speakers, for additional or closing remarks. Michael Rapino : Thank you everybody. We'll talk to you soon. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Live Nation Entertainment First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the Company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the Company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in their earnings release. The release, reconciliation and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found in the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website at investors.livenationentertainment.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2019 conference call. 2019 is off to a strong start with our highest first quarter AOI ever at $115 million and with revenue up 17% to $1.7 billion. Our Concerts and Sponsorship segments drove this growth, as both delivered record first quarter revenue and AOI. More importantly, we have now booked enough concerts, sold enough tickets and secured enough sponsorship commitments to be confident that Company will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year. We continue to benefit from a global concerts industry that is structurally growing with strong tailwinds for both supply and demand. Our performance is further accelerated by our concert flywheel, driving additional profitable growth in our onsite sponsorship and ticketing businesses. Starting with the concert business, we had almost 15 million fans attend our concerts during the first quarter, up 22% year-on-year, led by our arena and theater shows, which are each up over 1 million fans. As a result, revenue was up 27% and we delivered our first positive AOI Q1 in our concerts business. This sets up the year well and through mid-April, we have sold 49 million for our concerts this year, up 5% year-on-year. At the same time, we have continued shifting to market based pricing, growing the use of platinum tickets. Looking at our front of house tickets, amphitheater pricing is up double digits this year, and both amphitheaters and arenas have seen an increase in pricing of over 30% across the past two years. Even with this improved pricing, we're not seeing any pullback in demand for concerts as sell-through rates continue to be strong globally, across arenas, amphitheaters and stadiums, and from the best seats in the front to the lawn seats at our amphitheaters. As we add fans, we continue to improve our onsite experience, which then drives fan spending. While we are just beginning the amphitheater season, I expect us to once again grow average per fan spending by $2 this year in our amphitheaters. With our global concerts business set to deliver strong AOI growth again, the Concerts segment continues to be the engine that powers the overall growth of Live Nation. In what is typically our lowest activity quarter for Sponsorship, revenue was up 1% and AOI up 2%. Through mid-April, we are pacing double-digits ahead of last year in committed net revenue, reaching over 80% of our target for the full-year I expect our growth to be driven again by our festivals and large strategic sponsors, and we continue adding a number of these new partners, including Verizon in the U.S., Rogers Communications in Canada and Diageo in Europe. As a result, I expect we will deliver double-digit AOI growth in Sponsorship again this year. In the first quarter, Ticketmaster delivered its fourth highest transacted fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, trailing only Q1 2018 and Q4 in 2017 and 2018. While Ticketmaster was impacted in the quarter by a pull forward of onsales into the fourth quarter of 2018, by mid-March those sales trends had turned around, and through mid-April, Ticketmaster has sold 4 million more concert tickets for shows this year than at the same time last year. Putting aside quarterly fluctuations, every metric, including global GTV, ticket sales, clients served, and leading digital ticket functionality, demonstrates that Ticketmaster is the most effective marketplace to sell tickets to fans. Our roadmap at Ticketmaster remains very clear and focused, deploy digital ticketing at scale and establish the foundation for a direct relationship with our fans, which will improve the fan experience, provide opportunities for content, venue operators and sponsors to deliver greater ongoing value to the live event fan. As part of this, we remain on track to have Presence installed at over 500 venues with more than 135 million fans entering via the system this year. And following our successful first year of digital ticketing with the NFL, we are seeing more teams shift to a pure digital model, up to seven teams this year from two last year. In summary, I expect Ticketmaster, for the full-year, to deliver GTV and AOI growth, while significantly expanding our digital ticketing footprint. I am pleased with our first quarter results as a start to what we expect to be another record year in 2019. All of our key indicators speak to continued strong consumer demand for our concerts, our attendance growth in the first quarter, acceptance of market pricing, and solid sales for upcoming shows. As a result, we see an acceleration of our growth in the Q2, with overall AOI increasing in the high-teens and each division delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter. The combination of this near-term view plus concert ticket sales for the year, sponsorship commitments, and continued success of the Ticketmaster platform gives us confidence that Live Nation will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full year. With that, I will turn the call over Joe to take you through more additional details. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, Concerts. In the first quarter, Live Nation promoted 8,000 concerts for nearly 15 million fans worldwide, increases of 12%and 22%, respectively. Fan growth was strong across both North America and international markets, led in particular by arena, show count and fan growth, along with increased theater activity. Looking to the full-year, we expect to grow our fan base in both North America and internationally with arenas, theaters and clubs and festivals leading this growth. Our international markets are looking particularly strong, driven also by a resurgence of stadium shows for 2019, including such artists as BTS, Ed Sheeran and Metallica. In total, we expect overall fan growth for the year in the mid single-digits, which combined with our pricing initiatives and onsite spending programs we expect will deliver strong double-digit AOI growth for the concert segment. Turning to our Sponsorship and Advertising business. AOI was up 2% for the quarter and revenue was up 1%. Sponsorship is the only segment where we saw material effects impact in the quarter and excluding effects, AOI was up 7% and revenue was up 4%. Given over 85% of our sponsorship is recognized in the second through fourth quarters, it is our committed net revenue that is our most important indicator at this point of the year. And, as Michael indicated, our committed net revenue is up double-digits at over 80% of our target for the year. We're seeing consistent growth with both North America and international markets pacing double-digits ahead of this point last year as our both online advertising and sponsorship. And within Sponsorship, festival sponsorship per fan and revenue from strategic sponsors are both projected to be up double-digits for the year. This broad growth gives us confidence that we will deliver another year of double-digit AOI growth in sponsorship. Finally, Ticketing. Ticketmaster's global GTV in the first quarter with $7.6 billion, down 10% year-on-year. Both primary and secondary ticketing GTV were down similarly and in both cases concerts activity was the main driver. This is consistent with the general sales pattern we see with secondary, where most activity is either immediately following the onsale or in the few weeks leading up to the show. Thereby accelerating concert onsales into the fourth quarter, we have the same impact on secondary sales. As Michael indicated, our digital ticketing deployment is proceeding well and we will evolve it to the next level with the NFL this year shifting to encrypted barcodes as we continue to give content more control over how tickets are sold and managed. One of the key implications of digital ticketing is our ongoing shift to mobile ticketing with mobile ticket sales accounting for 46% of total ticket sales in the quarter and also driving a 40% increase in our installed app base to over 60 million. These app installs are critical as it gives us a real-time channel to our digital fans, enabling teams, artists, the venues and our brand partners to directly reach these fans. As Michael noted, we expect we will see growth in fee-bearing GTV for the full year, which will deliver our full-year AOI growth for ticketing in the mid single-digits. In summary, following a successful first quarter, we're shaping up to accelerate this growth in the second quarter. This starts with increasing concert attendance, particularly in stadiums and theaters during the second quarter. In Q2 results will also benefit from a shift in some of our major festival activity from Q3 into Q2, which helps both Concerts and Sponsorship. Looking at the full-year, given the strength of our leading indicators across Concert, Sponsorship and Ticketing, we are confident that we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full-year in the same range as we have grown over the past several years I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard : Thanks, Joe; and good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2019, our revenue was up 17% to $1.7 billion, AOI increased 1% to $115 million and, as of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.8 billion, up slightly compared to last year. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by Concerts, which grew by 27% as a result of increased activity in arenas and theaters globally, which also then delivered the increase in AOI for the quarter. Overall, our AOI for the first quarter finished stronger than what we had expected a few months ago due to a few items. In Concerts, globally, we had a large number of theater shows that performed strongly and we also saw a shift of some artists performance payments from Q1 into Q2. And in Ticketing, our ticket sales accelerated starting in mid-March, as Michael noted. Our operating loss was $24 million in the first quarter, driven by higher depreciation and amortization along with acquisition-related costs. And our net loss for the quarter was $52 million compared to $34 million in the prior year, as a result of the higher operating loss. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was $12 million. For the full year, we currently estimate that this accretion will be approximately $62 million with the remainder for the year fairly consistent across the quarters. For Q1, we had a negative FX impact on revenue and AOI of about 3%. And based on the rates now, we expect both to be impacted negatively by approximately 1% in the second quarter. Amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances in 2019 is expected to be in line with the last few years of expense. Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, we had total cash of $2.7 billion, including $848 million in client cash and $1.4 billion in net concert event related cash, leaving free cash balance of $382 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $469 million as compared to $775 million last year, impacted by the shift of ticket sales into the fourth quarter of 2018. Free cash flow adjusted was $3 million, driven by the timing of distributions to non-controlling interest. We currently expect that free cash flow, as a percentage of AOI for full year 2019, will be in line with the prior year. Our total capital expenditures for the quarter were $62 million with 60% spent on revenue generating items. We currently expect that our capital expenditures for the full-year will be approximately $310 million, with more than half on revenue generating addition. The increase in capital expenditures as compared to last year is driven by Concerts as we continue to expand our venue footprint globally and improve our existing venues to drive fan satisfactions, ancillary spend and sponsorship opportunities. Our total debt, as of March 31st, was $2.8 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.3%. We implemented the new lease accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2019, so you will see operating lease assets of $1.1 billion and total operating lease liabilities of $1.2 billion on our balance sheet, as of March 31, 2019. These amounts are based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments of our various operating leases globally that have terms greater than one-year. This new lease guidance will not have a material impact to our income statement going forward. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take the first question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is David. As you noted, I think this your first quarter with a positive AOI in Concerts after posting modest losses going back at least to the Ticketmaster merger. How much of this is driven just by scale on higher attendance or there are other factors that have shifted in the business that now you're realizing a positive result in the first quarter. Michael Rapino : Yes. That's all fundamentally driven by the higher attendance, David. As we said, we're very strong in arenas and theaters for the quarter, record attendance so that drove through to the higher performance, which then was supported by the pricing that we have which has higher flow through and just as we continue to scale the business. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then in the theaters and clubs division, you've been fairly active over the past month in Southern California adding new venues, booking relationships, can you just talk about the strategic extension opportunities that you see in getting scale at such a local level and how much room is there to sort of repeat this strategy in other areas? Michael Rapino : Yes. David, we've been talking about the diversity of our concert business both geographically, so our goal is to continue to be a global business. There are lots of countries, 42 we're in and many more cities where we want to keep building, whether it's our festival business, our concert business or our venue business. So those releases you see are just continual bolt-ons in markets like San Diego or Los Angeles or London or Paris where we see an opportunity to pick up a great promoter, pick up a venue. And as you know from our financials when we manage the venue, our per head margin increases. So we're always looking for opportunities to bolt-on pieces of the venue or promoter or festival business in markets around the world and you'll see that continue for years to come. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just on your ticketing result, can you say if there are any ongoing data breach expenses in the quarter? Is there any impact to margin at all from rolling out Presence? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think as we talked about in the last call, we expected to see data breach costs in the high-single millions over the course of this year. So as we also said, we expected that to be primarily in Q1 and Q2, so you do have some of that in this quarter. As it relates to Presence, there's nothing new or different really from a cost standpoint of deploying Presence at this point. It's continuing to roll out some access control systems at the venues, which will be on the capital side, but nothing material on the operational side. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take the next question. Amy Yong : Good afternoon. This is Amy Young from Macquarie. Maybe just following up on ticketing. What activity drove the turnaround in mid-March and April? Was there anything specific that you can talk about? And then can you update us on the progress that ticketing is making on the international front? And lastly, I think a lot of us understand that there's an option to buy in the remainder of Rock in Rio. Can you help us understand what the puts and takes are for that specific deal? Thank you. Michael Rapino : Sure. In terms of the turnaround, I think, Amy, more than anything else it was just the catching up of what the pull forward was in Q4 and having that run its course in Q1. We didn't know whether that was going to run its course end of February, end of March, end of April. There was just that uncertainty when we last spoke. So it ended up playing out, but as of the middle of March, this was when we basically saw ourselves work that out of the system. And then that combined with as we thought, it's a very strong theater business, which tended to have a shorter lead time when the shows are announced to onsale to play, also augmented the quarter for us. It was a particularly \u2013 speaking then on international, it was a particularly strong quarter for international. That business continues to grow well as we follow the concerts globally and build the business in the markets where we have a strong Concerts Presence and less of a historical Ticketmaster Presence. I don't think we have anything structural to announce at this point, but certainly our strategy remains on course to use the concerts as the flywheel and to have ticketing benefit from that activity. In terms of Rock in Rio, yes, we have got certain options as you said, nothing has been done at this point. I don't think we're in a position to comment on what we're going to do or not do until we make a final determination. Amy Yong : Got it. And congrats on the quarter. Joe Berchtold : But we will say, Amy, we're thrilled with the acquisition. Rock in Rio this year is going to have a record year attendance ticket sales profitability. So we've always known that's one of prized jewels in the global festival business, so we're using it. One, we think the festival fabulous, it's got expansion to it and it's been a huge part of our South American entry. So you'll see us do more, invest more in it. It is the general strategy regardless of what day we do what part. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go and take the next caller. Brandon Ross : Hi, it's Brandon Ross from BTIG. On your mid single-digit AOI growth for tickets that you gave us guidance, what's your assumption for the timing of onsale this year? Do you expect a similar pull forward in Q4 like we saw in Q4 of 2018? And then I have another one. Michael Rapino : Yes. We've seen sales go earlier and earlier, so I think you'll see more and more activity in Q4 for the following year seems to be the trend in the last couple of years. Brandon Ross : Okay. And then maybe a follow-up on David's. With your CapEx growth accelerating this year, you've mentioned you're expanding your venue footprint. Can you talk a little more about exactly what types of venues you're investing in and where you're investing in that? Michael Rapino : Music venues, Brandon. Does that help your model? Brandon Ross : Amphitheaters, Theaters. Michael Rapino : Yes. Music venues, right. We have 50 amphitheaters, we love that model, continues to be a high-margin business. It drives sponsorships, drives ticketing, drives our global food and beverage, so you'll see us \u2013 if there's opportunities, we'll keep expanding that footprint, both here and around the world. From the 500-seat to 6,000-seat range, I think we have over 200 and something of those venues now. In House of Blues to Fillmore to Europe, we have a strong portfolio, Australia, we do Canada. We see those as a real great sweet spot of upcoming talent. Huge piece of the youth culture, so it drives our sponsorship, our data around that segment, those customers tend to go to shows five, six times versus a higher-end show at the arenas you go two times. So you get a real active young audience when you're in the kind of the 500 to 6,000 seats. They seem to be the new movie theater for every developer. So we have great opportunities to kind of leverage our content for more equity, more revenue, more of the pie in the right development. So I think we're in a really sweet spot where the live theater is a part that a lot of the developers, real estate, neighborhood, city centers they all want that venue to be part of their attraction in urban centers. So we continually have a big opportunity and a long list of options where we will continue to, whether we acquire the lease, whether we manage, whether we book or whether we bill, we think they are good accretive businesses on overall expansion globally. Brandon Ross : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go and take the next question. Douglas Arthur : It's Doug Arthur. Joe, you made a comment about the timing of festivals shifting from Q3 to Q2. Is that something \u2013 in terms of modeling, is that material? Or is that more sort of on the margin in terms of how it's going to skew the seasonality of the concert sector? Joe Berchtold : As I mentioned and you can assume it's probably meaningful to think through. We just have a couple of festivals that traditionally sit over those weekends of the end of June, beginning in July. and based on how the weekend falls, it could either goes more into Q2 or Q3. So we're just making sure to point that out, so as you guys do your modeling, you get the balance between Q2 and Q3. Douglas Arthur : Okay. And then, I mean you guys were quite cautious on the first quarter. We talked about a little bit on this call. It seems like the Ticketing segment kind of in terms of the timing of these onsales kind of did what you thought it would do, Sponsorship and Advertising was pretty swell in the quarter, obviously the buildup is later. So ergo, the big surprise, which I'm surprised it was such a big surprise was in the Concerts segment in terms of very strong revenue growth. I guess when you did your fourth quarter, you do not quite have the visibility on that at the time or how do you see that playing out versus what you've originally expected? Joe Berchtold : Well, I think, on the Ticketmaster part, as I said on earlier part of the call, we didn't know when that was going to fully work through the Q4 pull forward and how much of it was incremental and how much of it was timing. So until we saw that play out, we didn't know what that was. Now we've now seen it play out, it was on the positive end of the spectrum of what we had hoped for. And as we said, as of mid-July, Ticketmaster has sold 4 million more concert tickets for shows this year than it sold at this point last year. So that was definitely an unknown for us when we did the call in February. Another thing is on the Concert side, I've said a few times that the theater side of the business in particular has been strong and that tends to be shorter lead time. And then I think third is overall we've been very happy with the sell-through rates. As Michael mentioned, they've been very strong. You've listened to other companies' calls and you hear concerns about the economic cycle that was again an unknown to us and I think that having sell-through rates that are at or above last year's across venue type and across ticket types has been something that's given us \u2013 maybe still a lot better today than we did a few months ago. Michael Rapino : And Doug just to jump on that, I think that last point is the fundamental. We were going into a year, we want to make sure that globally, environmentally that there was not \u2013 no speed bumps that were going to affect our business. Our sell-through really, really picked up halfway through Q1. We do our annual concert week. I think it's our third or maybe fourth year now. We sold 1 million tickets yesterday, which would have been more than what we would have sold in three days last year. So that is another example of the market is very strong. From club shows to festivals, our European business is very strong. So we are very optimistic now that there is no slow down at all on a global consumer demand perspective. Our business is strong. Douglas Arthur : All right. Okay. That's very helpful. And then I guess, finally, sort of a nerdy question, but to the extent that you sell more tickets via mobile and via the app, does that improve your data, the granularity of your data, and help you drive sponsorships? Joe Berchtold : Great question. Michael Rapino : Best question so far. Joe Berchtold : So selling tickets on the app, under the historical model, once we've had a material difference in terms of the data we have. As we shift to digital ticketing and we get the identity, when we have all of those individuals identified on data, it gives us, first of all, much better data. Second of all, by having a combination of cellphone numbers and app installs, it enables us to connect with them directly real-time via phone, so whether that's a sponsor, an artist, a team, Ticketmaster marketing it provides a much more effective marketing platform. Douglas Arthur : Great, okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take another question. Ryan Sundby : Yes. Hi. Ryan Sundby, William Blair. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my question. Michael, in the press release, as you called out, you've really done a great job driving front of house, and arenas and amphitheater over the last couple of years. I was just wondering if you can maybe talk about what pricing has looked like at \u2013 for the rest of the house. And then maybe tie that in with kind of how your unsold inventory looks today versus kind of what you shared a few years ago in something like 25% of tickets were going unsold? Michael Rapino : Yes. On kind of our annual Investor Day we do in November. I mean I have those numbers up on the slide again. I can't remember the precise number, but you can go back and look at that. The progress has been there year-over-year. So few factors, one, we just continue and look at the demand on the secondary market over the last few years. As much as we've been increasing the P1, the secondary business has also been growing. So we know there's $8 billion to $10 billion of opportunities still priced outside of the house from a consumer demand perspective. So we know we got years left and we'll be sitting on this call telling you that we've slowly increased the price and it's a slower process, because the artist has to find that right balance between what he will charge that makes sense for his fan and his brand and what the market will bear. That allows us to be some in efficiency, but a great progress. The artists is much more \u2013 the appetite is a lot larger now as we\u2019ve moved forward and exceed kind of a sunlight on what the artist or what's these tickets are selling for. So we have a great opportunity to keep pricing upfront. I think we've talked about before. The great advantage of pricing upfront is you also then get some extra growth in the pot to reduce the pricing in the back. A problem in the concert business is never been to sell the first 30 rows, it's can you sell those final 30 rows and get that customer in the house and when they buy a beer and they drive your sponsorship and your data. So one of the reasons you see our revenue and our ticket sales continually grow and we think again this will be a multiyear strategy for us is, we've been able to price the house better in the back, lower the price when it's needed to promote, do some promotions, do what you can, yet net overall the artist is still have a higher gross, higher revenue for the whole house. So a more sophisticated pricing has come into effect, price the front of the house better, price the Tuesday different than a Friday, price the aisle seat different than the middle seat. All of the classic airlines will tell models of dynamic pricing and all of those strategies have been slowly introduced and implemented. It's been driving our overall revenue as well as our throughput on the show. And then once they get in the show, you know all of those things we talked about how we monetize them. So we've been driving more tickets. I think our sell-through we've been talking about closing the gap. Again, we have a multiyear run rate of opportunity ahead, because at the end of the day the majority of shows still don't sell out. So we always have a lot of inventory to keep putting another person through the turnstile and whether it's \u2013 at 8 :01 that ticket is worth zero. So as long as between the announcement and 7 :59, we figured out how to monetize that customer at any price to get him through the door the business continues to move. So we've been moving that number up over the last few years. I think one or two points a year. I think we said in November, we look to that to be a $100 million plus opportunity as we put more people through the house over the next few years by pricing the house better. Ryan Sundby : Okay, got it. Very helpful. And then I guess in the QIC, you called out higher tuning activity in Asia as a driver of concert growth. Just wondering, if you could, maybe provide just a little more color on where that came from? And then maybe just take a step back and remind us kind of what countries are you materially in today? I mean, as you look over the next five years, kind of what are the big opportunities in Asia to drive growth? Michael Rapino : I'm not sure where the Asia comment came from. We've been building our global business for years, as you know. We're in 42 markets, where we have a Live Nation office, where we're promoting the show. It is a global bundle of local business. You have to have boots on the ground to actually execute. So if you look at our business on a global perspective, historically our European, Western European, Canada, U.S. and Australia have been the traditional markets of a global business. And you've seen in the last five years, whether it's South America, whether it's Asia or Eastern Europe, we've been slowly building out the infrastructure in those markets. We believe that the \u2013 now that the artist is global in terms of when Drake drops a single tomorrow, that 19-year-old in Singapore, Colombia and Cape Town knows about it as well as that one in Detroit. So it is a fast expanding global business. Every major city in the world wants to be an entertainment capital and have Drake perform there. The infrastructure is being built. So you're going to see us continue and be aggressive in Asia, South America, India and Eastern Europe, as those markets are becoming every year more legitimate. I think Asia comment might have been driven by our BTS tour. It's a great success story, we're very proud to be part of that global tour and that might be where the Asia comment came in. Overall, our Asia business is a growing business. We've been in China, Hong Kong and Singapore for years. We've been continually looking to grow those businesses and we will over time. Ryan Sundby : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to you for any additional remarks. Michael Rapino : All right. Thank you, everybody. Operator : Well, thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

Michael Rapino : Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter 2019 conference call. We delivered strong growth for the quarter, with AOI up 23%, and revenue up 10%. Each of our businesses contributed to these results, with all of them delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter.We continue to benefit from a strong tailwind in the live event, experience-based economy of today. The global ticket revenue for our concerts is up 16% for the first half of the year, as we continue to see a strong supply of artists touring matched with global consumer demand. And within this, the ticket revenue from concerts outside our top 100 artists is up 32% for the year, demonstrating that the demand for live music is strong and growing from the largest stadiums to the local clubs.We have created the most scalable and unparalleled business model in the industry, building a platform that brings over 570 million fans in 45 countries to live events each year.With our key metrics in concerts, sponsorship and ticketing all pacing well ahead of last year, I am confident that 2019 the company will deliver again double-digit AOI growth.Starting with our concerts business, through mid-July we have sold over 73 million tickets for shows this year, up 6% or 4.5 million tickets from the same point last year. This puts us on track to have nearly 100 million fans attend 38,000 concerts this year.In the second quarter, we had 27 million fans attend 10,000 shows, up 7% and 9%, respectively, from last year, and by far our largest second quarter ever. As a result, for the quarter we grew AOI by 33% and revenue a 11%.As we have discussed, our international business has been particularly strong through the first half, growing our fan base by 2.5 million fans with the greatest growth coming from our arenas, stadiums and theaters.Globally, we continue to work with artists to enable them to capture the value from their shows, through optimized pricing and Ticketmaster tools such as Platinum, we have delivered over $500 million in incremental value to artists since the start of 2018. Through this, we have seen no reduction in demand, and global sell-through rates across stadiums, arenas and amphitheaters is strong as ever.Further, at our venues we continue to increase average fan per spend by enhancing the fan experience, providing reasons for them to arrive earlier, spending less time in line and improving the quality of food and beverage offerings. As a result, our ancillary revenue per fan at amphitheaters to grow by $2.50 this year.Overall, we see continue to see tremendous opportunity for us to grow our global market share, both organically and via targeted acquisitions. Our just announced acquisition of OCESA in Mexico, one of the top global promoters, continues our mission of building a global fan base of 125 million. All this gives me confidence that we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth in our concerts business this year.Our sponsorship business leverages our platform of nearly 100 million fans, providing brands a unique opportunity to connect directly with music fans at scale. By continuing to attract new brand partners and expand relationships with existing ones, we grew our AOI by 12% in the second quarter and revenue by 8%.Much of the growth continue to come from large strategic partnerships, all of whom utilize a range our assets and span multiple years. This group accounts for over 70% of our total sponsorship, and the number of these sponsors has grown double-digits this year as we have added companies such as Adobe, Hyundai and Google. As a result, the committed spend by these strategic sponsors is also up double-digits through mid-July.Globally, festivals in particular provide an attractive opportunity for sponsors to engage fans at time when they are receptive to brand messages. And once again, our festival sponsorship is on track for revenue per fan to be up double-digits this year, thanks in part to a growing portfolio of marquee festivals including Lollapalooza, Rock in Rio and EDC, which are of particular interest to brand partners.Given the attractiveness of our platform to brands, and the double-digit growth in committed net revenue for the year, I expect we\u2019ll deliver sponsorship AOI growth in the mid-to-high teens for the full year.Ticketmaster continues to demonstrate that it is the best global ticketing marketplace for venues, teams, artists and fans, with fee-bearing GTV growth of 13% at constant currency in a quarter, making it our highest second quarter GTV ever. As a result, Ticketmaster\u2019s AOI for the quarter was up 20% and revenue up 6%.The addition of major clients such as Evenko in Canada, Chase Center in the U.S., O2 in Prague, and 150 others worldwide further validates that Ticketmaster is content\u2019s choice as the most effective ticketing platform in the world, with leading technology to service venues, sports teams and artists, with an efficient marketplace that attracts and converts ticket buyers.Our industry-leading digital ticketing rollout is ahead of schedule, with Presence now expected to be installed at over 600 venues this year, including over 80% of major sports buildings and Live Nation amphitheaters.And as the ticket is increasingly digital, we are focused on ensuring our mobile marketplace are the easiest place for fans to buy and manage their tickets. Because of that, we have seen a continued shift to mobile ticket buying, up 22% from the second quarter last year and now account for 45% of global ticket sales to date. At the same time, we have been improving the consumer purchase process, with increased conversion both across mobile and desktop.As Ticketmaster continues to be an effective and efficient ticketing solution for content and fans alike, we expect to continue growing its GTV and result in AOI this year and into the future.In summary, 2019 is on track for the company to deliver double-digit AOI growth along with strong gains in revenue. Each of our businesses is contributing to the success, starting with concerts as we put on more shows for more fans, then continuing to monetize fans at the concert, sell more tickets to the shows, and further deliver value to our sponsors from our platform of nearly 100 million fans.With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more details of our performance this quarter. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael. Getting into our business segments, first Concerts. Live Nation Concerts AOI in the second quarter was up 33% and revenue was up 11%. Driving that growth, concerts had its highest second quarter attendance ever, and for the first half of the year we saw fan growth across most of our venue types with arenas, stadiums and theaters each up over a million fans.And as Michael mentioned, we continue to optimize pricing, providing incremental artist revenue of $500 million since the start of 2018 across all of our shows, driven largely by an increase of over 30% in front of house pricing at amphitheaters and arenas globally.Bookings of a full year, we have already sold over 73 million tickets for shows this year through mid-July, an increase of 6% and we now expect nearly 100 million fans for the full year. Our pipeline of arena and amphitheater shows continues to be very robust with over 5600 shows booked through mid-July, up 3% compared to this point last year.Our international stadiums and arenas are looking particularly strong, driven by acts such as Metallica in Europe, post-Malone in Australia and BLACKPINK in Asia. While our amphitheaters are not driving substantial fan growth this year after attendance growth of over 2.5 million last year, we continue to be very successful in driving ancillary spend per fan. And festival tickets are up double-digits through mid-July and we expect this to continue for the full year, our 100 plus festivals hosts over 10 million fans this year.We expect our theater attendance to be up over 20% for the year and part benefiting from investments to expand our footprint with new venues such as the Fillmore in New Orleans and the Observatory venues in Southern California added to our portfolio in the first half of the year.With good visibility into the full year based on mid single digit growth in global fan attendance and continued operating improvements, we're confident that we will again deliver double-digit growth in concerts AOI for the full year.Turning to our Sponsorship and Advertising business. Our Sponsorship AOI was up 12% in the second quarter, while revenue was up 8%. Most of our growth came from the sponsorship side fairly evenly split between North America and international markets.As part of the growth in strategic sponsors that Michael mentioned, we have also successfully expanded the breadth of our sponsorship categories with the addition of non-traditional categories such as fashion, beauty and retail, including companies such as American Apparel, Pantene and Asics.Additionally investments in unique sponsor experiences within our venues, including VIP viewing decks and Instagram-worthy installations have drawn new sponsors and increased spending from existing ones. Collectively, this has led to 18% year-to-date growth in sponsor committed net revenue for the year. And based on this progress, we are confident we will deliver mid to high teens AOI growth in sponsorship for the full year.Finally Ticketmaster. For the second quarter Ticketmaster AOI was up 20% and revenue up 6%. Looking at our GTV growth in constant currency, total global fee bearing GTV was up 13% for the quarter and is now flat for the full year, with second quarter growth making up for the full forward from Q1 into Q4 of last year.The increasing global fee bearing GTV was driven predominantly by a 15% increase in primary GTV. And international was the main driver of our fee bearing GTV growth up over 40% for the quarter.Concerts activity continues to drive our growth accounting for over 90% of primary GTV growth in the quarter, heavily benefiting from our theaters festivals and arena activity.Secondary GTV was flat in the second quarter with increased activity in sports, offset by lower concerts volume and overall lower international activity. Based on our results for the first half and our second half pipeline, we expect Ticketmaster to deliver mid single digit AOI growth for the full year.In summary, Q2 is an outstanding quarter demonstrating the continued strong supply and demand dynamics across all of our businesses. Looking at the third quarter, comping 50 million AOI growth last year in Q3 and impacted by some shifts in concert timing into Q2, we expect Q3 to be up mid to high single digits. And as we continue driving growth across all of our businesses, we remain confident that 2019 will be another year of record top line and AOI results.I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard : Thanks, Joe. And good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the second quarter of 2019, our revenue was up 10% to $3.2 billion, AOI increased 23% to $319 million and operating income increased 27% to $172 million. All of our segments contributed to the increase in revenue, with concerts up $259 million or 11%, driven primarily by international arenas and stadium, along with global theater and festival activity.Sponsorship was up 8% due to growth from strategic sponsors and festivals in both North America and Europe and ticketing revenue increased 6% due to higher primary ticket fees.Our AOI growth of 23% for the second quarter was again driven by all three segments with each delivering double-digit growth for the quarter. Concerts increased by 33%, ticketing was up 20% and sponsorship grew by 12% from the growth drivers discussed above.Our operating income increased by 27% for the second quarter over last year, driven by the increase in AOI which also drove the increase in net income for the quarter to $103 million as compared to $69 million last year. For the quarter accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was $14 million, with a diluted earnings per share of $0.41.Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30th we had total cash of $2.3 billion, including $777 million in ticketing client cash and $1.1 billion in net concert event related cash, leaving free cash of $363 million.Net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months was $293 million compared to $520 million last year due to the timing of event related working capital. Free cash flow adjusted for the six months was in line with last year at $223 million, driven by our AOI increase, the timing of distributions to non-controlling interest partners and the maintenance capital expenditures for the first half of the year.As of June 30th, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.6 billion consistent with 2018. Our total capital expenditures were $139 million for the first six months with 57% spent on revenue generating item.Our total debt as of June 30th was $2.8 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.2%. For the remainder of 2019, we continue to expect that accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest will be $62 million for the full year with the remainder fairly evenly split between the remaining quarters.In Q2 we had a negative FX impact on revenue and AOI of about 2% percent, and based on current rates we expect them both to be impacted negatively by 1% to 2% in the third quarter.We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $310 million, with more than half on revenue generating CapEx. And we currently expect that free cash flow adjusted for the full year as a percentage of our 2019 AOI will be in the mid 50.Thank you for joining us today. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. David Karnovsky : Hi. Just on OCESA I know you've partnered with them for a number of years, but how did the acquisition now accelerate this both on the promotion and ticketing side in Latin America? And then just as a follow on, can you provide any detail around what you expect for the time line of regulatory approvals in Mexico and Columbia? Joe Berchtold : Sure. This is Joe. I\u2019ll answer those in reverse order. I think our expectations on regulatory approval with Q4 later in the year we don't know the exact timing. So we're not building it into our expectations at this point. But probably in a way part of a year and then I'll let Michael talk about how OCESA and how that's going to help us accelerate as we grow further in Mexico. Thank you. Michael Rapino : Yes, we're excited about the acquisition. It's consistent with our ongoing strategy. We still think there's a big fragmented global business out there. A lot of bolt-ons and both the concert, festival, venue side. Some of them are chunkier than others. This happens to be a top five global business.So we think this is a overall smart business. It helps us on our sponsorship, as brands are looking more and more for global solutions. That obviously helps our ticketing business and helps our tour - our global touring business. Aside from it obviously lays a big foundation to how we can continue to build our Latin American business. So it's checks the box on an all of our core growth drivers and we'll be excited when we close in the fall. David Karnovsky : Okay. We saw some press reports that Live Nation may potentially take majority ownership in Rock City. Can you confirm if this is the case and whether the Rock in Rio festival will be included in your consolidated results this year? Kathy Willard : Yes. Our guidance that we will give is all - we did give result based on Rock in Rio included and we will be able to consolidate for this year's festival. David Karnovsky : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Joyce : Thank you. If you could please provide some more color on your sizing of OCESA and their activities in 2018 and what are the opportunities in Rock in Rio, I don't think you have the ticketing for that right now. But in the past they've also taken that to other cities. Do you have any - the plans you can talk about there yet? Thank you. Joe Berchtold : I'll work backwards, Rock in Rio is a -- one of the top festivals in the world, probably on ticket sales over 7000 and probably it actually ranks as the biggest selling festival in the world. It doesn't happen every year, it happens every second year. And that's part of the magic and that the brand is created.So we think in itself it's a great big brand on a global basis. It obviously makes our entry into Brazil, give us some complete kind of an instant office sponsorship division to start building out our own concert business. And then as well you mentioned it will - as we try to do with all our bolt-on or acquisitions we ultimately look for ticketing synergy. In this case we don't have Ticketmaster there and we'll look to the to launch that to support our services in Brazil from there.OCESA, we don't usually talk about these until we close them because of the size we did this in this case, so we're not going to give much details today on OCESA and the numbers. Those will all be out in an 8-K when we actually close the deal and see it as a public company, so you could probably go figure out a lot of the math from the other side.But we're excited. They\u2019re strong business vertical like ourselves with ticketing, venues, sponsorship festivals and touring. So - and then they've been our partner for years and we're excited to have them as part of our platform. David Joyce : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Please go ahead. Doug Arthur : Yes, thanks. Joe, just looking - digging into the metrics on the concert segment in the second quarter, I mean, you highlighted the growth in international. It looks like your attendance in North America was actually down, but obviously events were up, so a lot of smaller shows. Should we read in anything into that for the third quarter, you talked about the fact that the amps are not going to be the big source of growth this year? Or is this just kind of quarter-to-quarter noise? Joe Berchtold : I wouldn't read anything into it at all. It's a combination of quarter-to-quarter and geographic bouncing around. So we've talked a lot about stadiums are very strong in international and that's where the stadium activity tends to have the bulk going on this year. So that's going to have some shift there. And whenever you have theaters is on fire as they are, that's not going to give you the same attendance per show.So again, I wouldn't read anything at all into it. Amps that incredible growth last year of over 2.5 million fans. So usually you don't see the same element in the same geography driving your growth multiple year - multiple years in a row. It tends to move around with the different pieces the growth come from. Michael Rapino : But to give us some perspective, if you look at amps over five years they've been continually growing at a great year. We expect them to keep growing. 2018 was an exceptional growth. If you've leveled out that growth this would be a great year. And we think next year and the year after the business will continue to grow.But also we've been -- we've always said one of the great realities of Live Nation is we diversify ourself on a global and venue platform. So sometimes international happens to be a little hotter than the U.S., amps are bigger than stadiums or stadiums might be bigger than arenas that year.And that's how we've always diversified ourselves where one may maybe 50 shows less than the year before. But the other segment or the other country happened to be on fire. So that's always been our goal - our global goal of having a diverse global business. And you ride the cycles that way, but you net the overall growth continually. Doug Arthur : And on the festival side despite - I mean, you highlighted this at the end of the first quarter that at least one or two major festivals would move into the second quarter this year versus third year ago. Sounds like you're still pretty bullish on this festival outlook for the balance through the third quarter? Joe Berchtold : No question this is a great year for festivals, as we said we'll have over 10 million fans at our festivals this year. The portfolio continues to perform extremely well. Along with what Michael said, it's part of the reason why we're in every venue type and why we have large portfolios. So when we see the aggregate growing we can have the type of success that we are. Doug Arthur : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Drew Borst : Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the onsite fan spending at your amps. I noticed that you guys did increase the guidance, you expect an additional $2.50 per fan this year, up from 2. I guess the question is, as you're rolling out presence into your amps, I think one of the opportunities is to use the platform for promotions of concessions and I guess I'm wondering connecting these two things, is that part of the reason you're seeing this incremental growth? Have you rolled out those promotions at the amps using presence or is that something that's still to come down the line? Joe Berchtold : Yes. Drew this is Joe. First of all, the shift from 2 to 50 when we gave you the two at the beginning of the May that was based on plans in place, it hadn't really had shows to speak of in a ramp yet. Now that we've had third number of shows, we're comfortable giving you more specific guidance based on what our results through the first third plus of our shows have been.As it relates to Presence, 100% agree, Presence is a great opportunity for us to engage fans on site and the per cap spending will absolutely be part of that, but it's not this year. That\u2019s as we're getting it fully rolled out and the promotions built that'll be more of a next year and go forward opportunity. Drew Borst : Okay. If I could ask one or two more. On the Rock in Rio festival you guys made some disclosures in 8-K when you made the acquisition about the financials of Rock City. I think I did all the math right. It looked like the last time in 2017 when they had the festival the EBITDA was somewhere on the order of $20 million to $25 million.Could you just confirm is that - that sound about right. I mean, obviously that might - hope that it grows now that you guys are sort of involved. But am I thinking about it sort of broadly correctly? Kathy Willard : Yes, those numbers are reasonable. Drew Borst : Okay. Kathy Willard : And it\u2019s a sponsorship business as well. Drew Borst : Great. And then just lastly, probably for you Kathy. Just on CapEx, I know it looks like you're - through the six months you're at 130 up about 30%. Can you just talk about sort of the full year expectations for CapEx? Kathy Willard : Yes, we said that we expect full year to be around $310 million at this point and over half of that's on revenue generating items. So it's including things like Presence rollout and increased benefits at the amphitheaters that\u2019s growing that EPS just\u2026 Joe Berchtold : We talked about some of the theaters that we've been building. So again, we think revenue generating CapEx spend growth is a good thing. It's capturing the opportunities that are out there and we think that it's running at 57% right now. We think that's a great use of the capital to keep building the business. Drew Borst : And then sorry, just finally, really last one. On OCESA, Televisa made some disclosures about how much you're paying to them, it looks like it's about $272 million for their 40% stake, but you're also buying another 11% from CIE. Is it somewhere in the order - we're talking about like maybe 350 to 375 sort of cash outlay for this acquisition is that about right? Michael Rapino : That's so nice. Like we should\u2026 Joe Berchtold : I mean, the K be coming out shortly that'll have all the numbers laid out, so rather than give loose numbers now I think better - to better get that in fairly short order. Drew Borst : Very well thank. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Tinker with Gabelli. Please go ahead. John Tinker : Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. I noticed that in the eBay numbers that StubHub was still up, I mean, volume was up 6%, revenue was up 7%. How do you think they keep growing given that you have been very effective at disintermediating the box? Joe Berchtold : Is he going to ask me Formula 1 question next? John Tinker : You are 60% of value Formula 1, that we should \u2013 I actually thought that Live Nation was an option on formula\u2026 Joe Berchtold : That was a good note, I'll take it. We're not going to get into the competitor in StubHub. You've been following their numbers over the years. It's a tough business on its own. We think our businesses long term has a great global opportunity. We don't think secondary is a business in itself long term, we think it's a - it's a piece of the overall global ticketing business that we're in. So we like our global position. We like our product mix right now and we like our client base. So I'm not sure what they do. John Tinker : I noticed that certain Event [ph] bought 48% of Front\u2019s BLA [ph] option to take control of it in four years. So had you took a look at the rest of the world how would you sort of rank in terms of priorities the countries you're looking at or the continents? Joe Berchtold : We wouldn't rank them. We think its -- we're in 44 countries. So, I think Event is not - nowhere near that. So we are a global business. So we look at opportunity more on a city by basis. There are great opportunities to grow in New York that we're going to invest in, as well as there are in Singapore and Tokyo.So, being as diverse as we are on a global basis we still kind of have our hit list of cities and markets where we think we're underdeveloped and whether it's a promoter or a festival or a venue, we want to fill that portfolio in a bolt-on.So you'll continue to see us shopping around the world where it makes sense to build that local market where we can drive our overall business. John Tinker : Okay, thanks. Congratulations on the quarter again. Joe Berchtold : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Kyle Evans with Stephens. Please go ahead. Kyle Evans : Thanks for taking my questions. Platinum looks like a great pricing solution, what inning do you think we're in for adoption. How much of the house could end up being dynamically priced? If we look out into the future and are you seeing any kind of impact on your own secondary market where I think GTV was flat in the quarter? Joe Berchtold : Yes, I'll start then Joe can give you some background. I mean, I'll just go macro. I think we're in the - I think sports is in a very different meaning than music, which is - obviously because they're more controlled, the leagues can make global decision. So I think sports is in the sixth or seventh inning in terms of how do they price the show or their content, how do they maximize it with the right combination of pricing.I think music is in a, the second, third inning on. How do we best price our event? How do we price a Thursday show versus a Saturday, an aisle seat versus the middle at the beginning and the end subscriptions, all the different ways that the artist can engage.So Platinum is a - I think been a super tool to tell the artist that there's a great way on your on sale to get a higher price for a good seat. And that's been very successful and I think that is still early days in the overall business. If you look at how much is still being traded on secondary, I would say there's still a huge opportunity for the artists to keep looking at find that fine line between what his brand message needs to be and what his pricing strategy will be. We still think there's many innings left to capture more.And when I say capture more, I always want to remind people, it's capture more, but it's sometimes it's price it less than the back. So it's a holistic strategy right on that dynamic pricing on how do you sell up the house by the time the performers are on stage and that's a holistic perspective that they're getting smarter every day on. Kyle Evans : The shows where I've seen and have been kind of one to two points of the total seats, where do you think that can go over time, roughly? Michael Rapino : Yes I think we're obviously a bit higher than that across most of the shows. Clearly, a number of themselves quickly even if their pricing so you may not be seeing the full inventory, but we absolutely see room for that to continue to grow through the first 20% of the house in some cases and also further use of that pricing technology and intelligence to make sure that we're appropriately pricing all the other tickets. The other ones may not be dynamic, but there continues to be additional benefit from taking that - that machine learning, artificial intelligence and applying it to how you price the overall house. Kyle Evans : Great. Last one, you broke apart the performance of the top 100 artists and the smaller artists and I don't recall you talking about the business that way before. Is that a trend you expect to continue going forward? Michael Rapino : Yes, for sure. I mean, we've been \u2013 Joe and I always get asked that question who's going to be the next superstar and we've been saying it for 10 years that this is a deep business, consumers love going to the Troubadour and the House of Blues as much as the stadium. So we do 8000 club shows a year. Very few investors even acknowledge it or talk about it. We just want to talk about the Asia.So we just wanted to continually remind that at all levels going to a live show is an incredible experience for the fan. And we're seeing more and more club shows, theatres, small shows. You look at things like Springsteen on Broadway, new ideas, new residencies, Madonna going out there this year doing smaller theaters at a higher price.So I think you're just going to see more and more ways, artists will look at traditional venues, smaller venues, unique venues, sizes to keep bringing their art to the consumer in a unique location and that's huge opportunity for us. Kyle Evans : Great. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to today's presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Michael Rapino : All right. Have a great summer. Thank you all. Operator : Once again, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Live Nation Entertainment Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters.Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results.Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in the earnings release. The release reconciliation and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website at investors.livenationentertainment.com.It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. Live Nation delivered its highest AOI quarter ever as we continue to scale our business globally and build on favorable supply/demand dynamics for live music. AOI grew 11% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date, outperforming a record Q3 last year and demonstrating the strength of our business model in today's experience-based economy. And in response to recent questions about consumer demand we are seeing fan spending as strong as ever.In September, our amphitheater and arena shows actually closed stronger than shows in September of last year. And our fan spending on site also showed ongoing growth. At the center of our flywheel, the demand for live events continues to grow as we have sold 92 million tickets through mid-October up 6% or 5 million tickets, compared to this time last year. And we are on track to nearly 100 million fans attending the show this year.And we have translated the fan growth into strong AOI gains on on-site spending, sponsorship and ticketing. As a result, as we wrap-up the successful 2019, we are confident that we will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year.Looking at our concerts business, year-to-date we have had 73 million fans attend over 26,000 concerts delivering $333 million in AOI, which is up 17% from last year.Our international business has been particularly robust this year delivering much of the fan growth with a strong year for stadiums and theaters, while in the U.S. our arena and theater activity was also up.As we have grown our show volume and the breadth of artists, we work with we've also been more effective in pricing tickets closer to the market value, particularly with the platinum pricing tool. So far this year, we have had over 3,000 arena and amphitheater shows use platinum tickets with a 54% increase in the number of platinum tickets sold per show.Looking at our venue operations, we have furthered our focus on the fan experience, improving our hospitality across the board from our food and beverage offering to our lawn experience to VIP options. As a result, we have increased our average revenue per fan by $2.50 in our amphitheaters to over $29, while also increasing fan spending at festivals theaters and clubs.As we continue building our expertise on on-site execution, we are finding more opportunities to build new venues or take over operations of existing venues. And since the start of this year, we have added 36 venues to our portfolio, ranging from the Brooklyn Bowls in New York and Las Vegas to the Danforth Music Hall in Toronto and Sportpaleis in Belgium.As a result, we are confident in the success of our concert flywheel for 2019. We will promote more shows reach more fans price more effectively and provide a better fan experience at our venues which will then drive double-digit AOI growth for the business this year.Turning to sponsorship. With the first days of Rock in Rio and a strong growth across our entire sponsorship platform, our high-margin sponsorship business delivered 18% AOI growth for the quarter and 13% year-to-date. We are the global leader in music sponsorship, delivering the unique value proposition of nearly 100 million fans on-site for brands looking to make a more direct connection with their customers.As part of this, we continue to innovate new ways for brands to interact with fans on-site at our venues and festivals with new programs such as the Bud Light branded photo installation at our amphitheaters or the Revlon roller rink at Lollapalooza. As a result, sponsorship revenue has grown 11% year-to-date at our venues, while festival sponsorship has grown 31% year-to-date.More broadly, growth is driven by our strategic sponsors, all of whom utilize a range of assets and span multiple years. Revenue from this group, which collectively accounted for 70% of our total sponsorship revenue, has grown 15% year-to-date. With over 95% of our expected sponsorship revenue for 2019 now contracted, we are confident that we will deliver sponsorship AOI growth in the mid-teens for the full year.Ticketmaster generated the highest AOI quarter ever, up 20% from last year and was 6% growth year-to-date as every quarter in 2019 is one of the top 10 GTV quarters ever. This growth continues to provide Ticketmaster the scale to invest in the evolution from paper tickets to digital, which is being demanded by venues and content that are seeking greater control of their tickets and looking to develop a more direct connection with fans.Our Presence rollout is pacing ahead of schedule and we expect digital ticketing to be installed at over 700 venues, representing 120 million tickets by the end of this year and over 60% of the fans at digital-enabled events now are entering with their mobile devices. And digital adoption is even greater in the NFL where 10 teams have now eliminated paper tickets and over 90% of fans for those games are using their mobile phones to get in.Digital ticketing has expanded our engagement with fans giving Ticketmaster a more direct connection providing for more effective marketing and targeted offers. The Ticketmaster app is now regularly in the top 10 ranking for entertainment in the Apple App Store, driving a 30% increase in app downloads this year. This combined with continued improvements in our mobile web experience, has led to further growth in mobile transactions now accounting for 46% of ticket purchases globally, up 15% over last year. Digital ticketing is a strong demonstration of what Ticketmaster can be, providing the best ticketing platform for venues by delivering value well beyond the sale of the ticket, but at the same time giving fans an ever-improving mobile-led purchasing and management experience.With these pieces coming together and continued growth in our concerts activity, I expect we will deliver AOI growth at Ticketmaster in the mid-single digits for the full year. As we approach the end of 2019, we are confident that our strong performance will deliver another record year of topline and AOI growth. All of our businesses, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing have delivered growth year-to-date. And based on their key operating metrics, we expect each to deliver record revenue and AOI for the full year.With an early look to next year, our 2020 pipeline is up substantially with over 1500 stadium arena and amphitheater shows booked already, up double-digits from the same time last year.As we look forward, we continue seeing tremendous opportunity to expand our global concerts and festival business, drive further growth in on-site execution, sponsorship and ticketing.With that I will turn the call over to Joe, who will take you through additional details on the quarter and the divisions. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael. Getting into our business segments first concerts. Over the combined past two quarters, which represent our core concert season, AOI was up 9% and revenue up 2% year-on-year, as we grew attendance 73 million fans at over 26,000 shows, up 3% and 11%, respectively.As we discussed on our second quarter call, timing this year somewhat shifted to Q2 versus Q3. And as a result for the third quarter attendance was 2 million lower than last year, resulting in slightly lower revenue in AOI.Looking at the full season though, every indicator we have is of a robust growing business. Our September results actually came in above our expectations, as our amphitheater and arena shows closed strongly and fan spending remained at high levels. This overperformance in ticket sales in the last two weeks before the shows resulted in over $5 million of incremental AOI in our amphitheaters relative to how the shows closed last year, demonstrating the continued strength of the concert business.As Michael said, much of our fan growth this year has come from our international markets, particularly with their stadium lineup. At the same time, we are seeing growing demands throughout our broad portfolio of venue types. Globally, theater shows are our highest growth venues this year as fans continue to find new up-and-coming artists they're excited about.And festivals remain the ultimate fan experience. And with the addition of Rock in Rio, the continued globalization of the Lollapalooza brand and our over 100 other festivals, we expect attendance to be up double-digits to over 10 million fans this year.Arenas continue to be the top place to see the biggest shows and we expect to add another 1 million fans this year, as fans came to see such top acts as the Backstreet Boys, Ariana Grande and John Mayer. For the fourth quarter, we see continued fan growth again driven by our theater shows but with AOI growth impacted by the cost structure and a seasonally lower period for concert activity.So looking at the growth this year and an even bigger pipeline of shows for next year combined with ongoing improvements in our on-site execution, we believe we are well set up for continued growth in concerts.Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. In the third quarter, sponsorship AOI was up 18% and revenue was up 26%, primarily driven by on-site sponsorship as our brand partners continue to recognize the value of engaging with fans at our events.International markets drove the majority of our growth with the first weekend of Rock in Rio contributing to our performance this quarter. And given the 14% growth in sponsor committed net revenue for the year, I'm confident we will deliver mid-teens AOI growth in sponsorship for the full year.Finally Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 20% and revenue was up 5%. Global GTV was up 4% for the quarter, driven by fee-bearing GTV which was up 5%. As with our concerts business, international drove our ticketing growth in the quarter with its fee-bearing GTV, up 19%. Globally, primary GTV was up 6% for the quarter while secondary GTV was flat. And as in the past, concerts drove most of our primary GTV growth.In secondary, we saw growth in sports, particularly the NFL, the lower activity in North America concerts again consistent with the concerts timing we have discussed. As another sign of success for the Ticketmaster platform, our open distribution strategy continues selling more tickets for clients off platform, up over 30% with 15 million tickets sold year-to-date.And to save you the question on margin, yes, we're up a fair bit this quarter, due in part to continued improvements in operational areas such as search marketing and also because of some insurance recovery for the data breach issue last year. But our overall focus remains on growing the cash profitability of the ticketing business, not being margin-focused, which is how we have consistently grown the business over the past several years and expect to continue being successful going forward.In summary, we are confident that 2019 will be another year of record revenue and AOI results, overall and for each of our businesses. We are also making progress on completing our OCESA acquisition. In August, we submitted the necessary request for approval to the two key regulatory agencies in Mexico and are working through their process. And in September, CIE received shareholder approval for the transaction.Pending the timing of the regulatory process, which is basically how many rounds of questions do they need to ask, we expect to complete the transaction between December and February and we'll provide updates as we have more information to share.I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard : Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon everyone. Our key financial highlights for the third quarter of 2019. Our revenue was down 2% to $3.8 billion. AOI increased 11% to $427 million and operating income increased 11% to $260 million. Our revenue decline in the quarter was primarily driven by a foreign exchange negative impact and without this, our revenue in the quarter was flat to last year. This FX impact largely affected concert, which along with the timing shift in events from Q3 to Q2 drove a 4% decrease in revenue.Sponsorship revenue increased 26% from the addition of the first weekend of Rock in Rio in Brazil and overall growth in our on-site sponsorship program. And ticketing delivered a 5% increase in revenue as strong international activity drove a 4% increase in global GTV.AOI growth was 11% in the third quarter driven mainly by sponsorship, which was up 18% and ticketing, which was up 20%, as a result of the higher GTV along with an insurance recovery related to the third-party data breach incident last year that we had not expected to receive in the quarter. This insurance recovery along with the strength in amphitheater show performance at the end of the quarter as Joe noted previously, drove our outperformance relative to the AOI guidance we provided in July.Our operating income increased by 11% for the third quarter over last year, driven by the increase in AOI. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was $24 million and our diluted earnings per share was $0.71.Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, we had total cash of $1.8 billion including $747 million in ticketing client cash and $642 million in net concert event-related cash leaving free cash of $406 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months was $33 million compared to $256 million last year, primarily due to the timing of when payment obligations were due.Free cash flow adjusted for the nine months was $531 million in line with last year's $529 million. Our conversion of AOI to free cash flow this year was reduced by the timing of distribution to our non-controlling interest partners and an increase in maintenance CapEx.Our total capital expenditures were $225 million for the first nine months with $120 million spent on revenue-generating items. We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $325 million with half going toward revenue-generating CapEx projects.As of September 30, our total deferred revenue related to future events was $952 million, an increase of 26% over the $759 million at this point last year. As of September 30, our total debt was $2.8 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.2%.And in October, we issued $950 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2027 and amended our senior secured credit facility including a new $950 million term loan B. In addition we have an undrawn $500 million revolver and a $400 million delayed draw term loan A. The proceeds from these transactions were used to redeem our $250 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2022 and to repay the outstanding balance of our existing term loan.After these repayments and other fees and expenses we will have $527 million of incremental cash on the balance sheet. This will allow us to meet the cash portion of our purchase price for the OCESA acquisition along with funding other acquisition opportunities.After this refinancing our weighted average cost of debt remains at 4.2% and we estimate that our interest expense will initially increase by approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter as a result of this refinance.For the remainder of 2019 we expect negative FX impacts of approximately 2% for revenue and 7% for AOI in the fourth quarter based on current rates. This FX headwind to AOI is largely driven by higher sponsorship activity in Brazil, Australia and New Zealand which are all projected to be up 7% in the fourth quarter and the Euro and British Pound which are projected to be up 4% to 5%.Revenue has less of an impact as that mix is more heavily weighted to the U.S.. We have factored this FX impact into our full year guidance that both Michael and Joe discussed which takes into consideration our reported year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter.Consistent with where we projected it last quarter we currently expect that free cash flow adjusted for the full year as a percentage of our 2019 AOI will be in the mid-50s. Our accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest for the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately $26 million. And as a reminder as you look forward to 2020 our Rock in Rio Festival which spans Q3 and Q4 this year is a biannual festival and will therefore not take place next year.Thank you for joining us today. Operator we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. David Karnovsky : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. You highlighted getting questions around consumer demand. I think maybe some of this pertained to macro and possibly recession risk. And the last time there was a downturn Live Nation was a pretty different company than it is today. So I'd be interested to know how you feel Live is positioned should we enter a softer economic period at some point? Joe Berchtold : Hey, David, this is Joe. I'll start that. First again as we gave with some of our numbers we have seen whatever periodic retail slowness in September or anything else that the market has looked at we have not seen that impact us at all. And in fact September this year as I gave the numbers was stronger than September of last year. So we're feeling very good how it's holding up in general.As you said, we think we're very different company than we were 10 years ago. We think our understanding of the consumer, our level of sophistication associated with pricing understanding different consumer segments, our ability to execute on site are all substantially higher. So we feel like our capabilities have certainly continued to develop and that the structural tailwinds we have and shifts in spend from goods to experience the globalization of our business all trends that lead to a lot of demand support under any economic scenario. Michael Rapino : And also this is -- it's Michael -- just to tie in. We're seeing also what is on sale for next year. Festivals and shows that are already on sale for next summer are showing strong demand no weakness at all in terms of the consumer buying the ticket. As well as Joe said our - people come to the shows in September spending at the show. So we haven't seen any pushback at all business as usual from a sales perspective. David Karnovsky : Okay. Very helpful. And then you highlighted an additional 36 venues year-to-date. I'm interested to know if you anticipate accelerating the strategy. Is there a specific type of venue that you're more focused on? And then finally I've been interested to get your view on Groot hospitality and how that adds to the portfolio. Michael Rapino : All right. I'll take a shot. You're coming across a little muffled there so I think -- I got to adjust a bit. We've always been in the on-site business and our most profitable businesses are our festivals where we get to count multiple revenue streams and our amphitheaters 50 of them that we have in America. Those will be our highest-margin concert venues or concert business. So we've always been expanding and looking at leasing and managing concert venues.We've had a portfolio of theaters and clubs House of Blues, Fillmores well over 100 of them now around the world. We've been managing those for the last 15 years or so. We like to look businesses \u2013 as they continue to be high on our contents, sponsorship and our ticketing. So we are continually looking at any concert venue from 500 feet up to amphitheaters if they're pure-play concert venues where our content can leverage our relationship into multiple revenue streams by managing or leasing or building that music venue. So on a global basis we continue to look at them as great returns. And they're the places that our flywheel comes to life the most leverageable in terms of content sponsorship and ticketing. David Karnovsky : Okay. And just anything on Groot? I'm not sure if it came through on the question. Michael Rapino : Groot, yes. So part of we've been talking about in the last two years in our hospitality food and beverage business is we are a very large food and beverage business on our own. If you just spun off food and beverage business we will be a world-leading hospitality food and beverage in terms of our revenue and footprint. And a big part of our revenue hospitality strategy is to continue to make sure we understand the high-end consumer and the hospitality around VIP and servicing that customer well.Our core DNA knows how to put a lot of people through buildings in an efficient manner and service them. We want to get more skill set to understand how to take care of the VIP high-end customer how best to set up the VIP, what does that VIP flow look like, how best to monetize the customers with a better and higher experience or unique experience.So Dave is an expert in the business in Miami. He's very successful in what he does. He's tested it at the Miami Dolphins stadium with his platform there. So we look at him and other skill sets like that that if we bring those in-house, open our platform to them, they will help us design, build and expand our VIP hospitality business in our current portfolio. David Karnovsky : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Benjamin Swinburne : Thank you, good morning. Just first on digital ticketing. You talked about Presence being ahead of schedule. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that? Is that demand driven or your ability to deploy that technology faster? And clearly it's resonating with consumers. You can see it in the app download data. Can you help us think about the financial benefits to the company over the longer term as that scales to become a majority or vast majority of your ticketing business? Joe Berchtold : Sure. This is Joe. I'll give it a start. First of all, in terms of the pace and why it's deploying faster. Two things, one is I think we've been successful because of how effective it's been both with the NFL as well as our own buildings. We're just seeing tremendous demand by other venues that are saying, we don't want to get left behind. We want to shift to digital, so we can be getting that consumer data, understanding better control of the ticket as well.And our processes for deploying the systems actually going to the venues, changing the access control systems, we've gotten that working well very quickly. So I think that has led us over the course of this year to move our target for installations from 500 to 600 now to 700 installations.So in terms of the long-term impact, clearly just for Ticketmaster, it's a fundamentally different value proposition that it provides through its venues now. It's no longer just selling a ticket, but it is providing an important data service. So that's an important piece of just what Ticketmaster is.And then we talked through there are a multitude of uses that the data will provide. It will support Ticketmaster and our concert business in terms of the effectiveness of their marketing, their ability to provide much more targeted information to fans based on what we think they're interested in. They'll be very important to our venue strategy in terms of being able to make offers to people based on what their past behavior is. It will be important for sponsors for them to directly tie in sponsor segments -- customer segments and target -- 100 million people are on-site. So the ability to do all of those things over the next several years, I think will be tremendously important throughout the entire company. Benjamin Swinburne : Got it. That's helpful. And just maybe one follow-up. The show pipeline for next year as you highlighted is up double digits. I know it's too early to talk about 2020 in a lot of detail, but does that suggest that events will be up double digits next year? Because you also have fairly sizable acquisition, which should close as well. I don't know if I'm over extrapolating but I just wanted to ask? Joe Berchtold : Sure. A couple of things. First of all, we haven't built in OCESA in our numbers yet because of the uncertainty over -- plus or minus a few months in terms of the timing. And so anything that we also give you in terms of the on sale would not have included them because we're not yet changing that data with them. I think, what you can take from it be up double digits at this point is two things. One is, it looks very strong for next year both in terms of the volume and then as Michael said, the early demand for what we do have put on sale is also very strong. And two is you're continuing the trend of seeing some shift into the fourth quarter in terms of timing and some of the onsales. So, I don't think we're ready to declare the exact amount that we're going to be up, but we're feeling very good as we're starting to turn the focus to 2020 shows. Benjamin Swinburne : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to David Joyce with Evercore ISI. David Joyce : Thank you. A couple of questions. First, on the deferred revenue being up 26%, what would that look like excluding the one week of Rock in Rio that falls in this quarter? And could you discuss other comparable planning events that would be impacting the concert performance for the fourth quarter? And then secondly, on CapEx, if you could talk about some of the components of the revenue-generating CapEx. What have you been doing on the real estate side? Kathy Willard : So on the deferred revenue yes Rock in Rio would be in there. But remember Rock in Rio as most festivals are is largely sponsorship-driven. And we haven't given any specific breakdowns. But the second weekend would be in Q4. We -- what we said on the other comments are that Q4 is largely going to be theaters and clubs-driven. So that will be part of it. And you will also be seeing some of the impacts of the onsales for next year in there as well. As far as CapEx, rev gen is going to be highly around. We said we added 36 venues. Part of that is going to be running through that continued enhancement along the Ticketmaster technology as well. Joe Berchtold : It's probably hospitality, right? Michael talked to hospitality. We talked a lot about the growth in forecast. We gave specific numbers at the end, but also around our festivals and our theaters as well. So, all of that is fairly a priority on our rev gen CapEx. David Joyce : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we will go next to Brandon Ross with LightShed. Brandon Ross : Hello. Joe Berchtold : Go ahead, Brandon. Brandon Ross : Okay. Sorry, we're having some phone troubles here. We're a startup. So, on sponsorship, you lowered your guide for the year from mid -- to mid-teens from mid to high. I guess you said the consumer is in great shape, but I just wanted to make sure you're finding the same with advertisers and sponsors. Or is there anything to read into there vis-\u00e0-vis the demand for Rock in Rio? And then on ticketing, I think your Q4 ticketing guide implies flat AOI year to year. How do we reconcile that with your increased show pipeline for next year and this continued trend to a shift in timing to Q4 onsales from Q1? Joe Berchtold : So on the first question, there is absolutely no shift in our overall outlook on sponsorship. The only change in our previous guidance was constant currency. But we saw a lot of modeling issues with people trying to understand constant versus reported. So, we shifted guidance to reported currency. And we gave you very explicitly and Kathy the fact that you're up 7% in Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and 4% to 5% in Great Britain and in Europe. So it's just that math that's having an effect and change where the numbers are. No change in terms of just what we would have given you constant currency versus reported. Michael Rapino : Plus the demand. Joe Berchtold : The demand is -- yeah, absolutely no change, no deterioration. In terms of second -- without getting to exact -- there's still some timing to be worked out in terms of exact onsales for ticketing. And then ticketing again you're going to have some of the same issues in terms of some of the FX impact.But overall, again, we're seeing robust show pipeline and robust consumer demand when we do flip them on show -- sorry, when we do flip the show to onsale. It's just a matter of when exactly they're all going to get put on sale.So we have a lot of shows that we have confirmed with the artists that they'll be touring. We have contracts with them. We're scheduling them. We have not declared whether those actual tours are going on sale in Q4 or Q1. Kathy Willard : And we're comping up a large Q4 last year on ticketing. So just keep that in mind in your whole comparison. Brandon Ross : Got it. Thanks for the question. Operator : And we will go next to Khoa Ngo with Jefferies. Khoa Ngo : Hi. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Michael Rapino : Yeah. Khoa Ngo : So first question is just around, you mentioned the strength of the consumer and you're not seeing any slowdown there. Can you maybe just frame up how much headroom you have on your ability to price the shows as we look forward?And then the second question is around the digital ticketing. Are there any gating factors to you increasing the venue rollout above 700 as we think about maybe 1,000 1,200? And as we move forward are there any gating factors for that? Joe Berchtold : So, first on consumer strength. The pricing headroom I think most recent number we've given is, we think there's still probably about $1 billion of price arbitrage if we look at the secondary market as a guide for market value of ticket prices relative to how we price tickets.And we absolutely believe that one of the factors during any economic slowdown is that provides the buffer. And that arbitrage gets eaten away before some of the fundamental demand hits our ticket. So that absolutely is a piece that gives us some greater comfort as we think about different economic cycles.In terms of digital ticketing the rollout, I think by the end of this year we'll have 80% of the major building. One gating factor is just you're not going to have your NBA and NHL teams yet mid-season. So if they didn't shift before the start of the season, they won't shift between now and the end of the year. It would be when they take a break again during their next cycle. And then it's just a matter of getting to a lot of the smaller buildings. Michael Rapino : Yes. It's Michael. Just on pricing just to give some narrative, the press likes to talk sometimes about the ticket pricing of the high shows. Overall concerts are at a very affordable price point. If you look at the average ticket pricing the $60 average fans go to two or three shows a year. It's still a very affordable lifetime memory versus a trip or a vacation.So in recession, we see that the consumer may pull back on high ticket items. They may not go on a vacation, may pull back on a new car. But to take his kids to Taylor Swift or his wife to a show or his friend, it's still a very, very affordable option that we know, because they're lifetime moments and Kodak moments of your life. They still make sure they go to that local show at the arena or stadium or amphitheater, because it's still incredibly affordable even if they're in a slight pullback on their cash spend.Now, I say that it also means we have -- why we believe the ticket is completely still underpriced like those $8 billion to $10 billion in the secondary market on an ongoing basis, we still think that the front of the house is widely underpriced. And year-over-year we'll make progress with the artists to keep pricing it better and taking some of that high-end opportunity into his pocket as well as lowering the price in the back end to get better -- full capacity.So, overall, we think the show is still a very affordable option in life, cheaper than a good dinner in a big picture with great pricing opportunity given we still think it is a very low-priced option if you compare it to an NBA game, a night at the theatre, a front-row seat at an NFL game, et cetera. So, we think concert is underpriced, lots of room for pricing, still affordable to everybody, no matter where their economic situation lies. And we think the secondary is the proof that we have upside. Khoa Ngo : Thanks very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet : Yeah. I just had a question on CapEx. I know you guys have always talked about 2% CapEx to revs. It seems like with the ticket move up in CapEx we're approaching sort of 3%. Do you see enough sort of good revenue opportunities that we should be thinking sort of 3% of revs as sort of a more reasonable number in the interim in the next few years as opposed to 2%? Or is 2019 sort of an aberration? Thanks. Kathy Willard : So, part of that just to restate. Those 2% were back before rev rec changes. So, it made a little bit of an increase in it. But I think around 2.5% is probably the right rule. And some years may cross a little bit above that. But just, yes, there are a lot of what we think are good investment opportunities, in our business in hospitality, in our technology that we think they're the right way to continue to invest in the business. Jason Bazinet : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Doug Arthur with Huber. Doug Arthur : Yeah. Hi. It's Doug Arthur. Joe, I'm wondering if you could delve into the mix in the concert business a little bit more in the third quarter. Obviously, you had cited some timing issues going into the quarter. The number of events in North America was up 15%. It looks like attendance for event was down close to 20%. So that's a pretty unusual mix for the third quarter. Does that reflect the lack of stadium shows basically? Or is there something else going on? Joe Berchtold : You have it exactly right. It's the mix shift. So if you look at -- just to start if you look at Q2 and Q3 together, because we told you we were going to have more weight in Q2 this year. But those two quarters together is the core concert segment. The concert business is up about 4%, on constant currency.So, first of all, you move a few points on the revenue side just because of the currency fluctuation. But really what's going on, as we've told you over the past nine months is we have fewer stadium shows. We have about 30 fewer stadium shows, this year than last year.And we've had tremendous growth in our theater shows in particular both in North America and internationally. Those stadium shows that we don't have are the highest-volume shows. And also the highest average ticket price.Your theater shows are going to be a much lower, average attendance. And also a lower ticket price. So all you're seeing is some mix shift going on. There still is across all of the venue type's very strong sell-through demand.We talked about platinum tickets. We talked about all of the components. So the performance is very strong across the board. And then, as we look at next year, we see a big uptick again, in our stadium volume which is what you get the first read on in the business, so, we're doing very good. There's absolutely nothing you should read into this other than timing. Doug Arthur : Great, thank you. Operator : At this time, I would like to hand the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Michael Rapino : Thank you everybody. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainment\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon\u2019s call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company\u2019s anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters.Please refer to Live Nation\u2019s SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company\u2019s most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results.Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in their earnings release. The release reconciliation and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation\u2019s website at investors.livenationentertainment.com.It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 conference call. In 2019, Live Nation delivered its ninth consecutive year of growth, with revenue up 7% and AOI up 14%.Starting with the core of our business, our concerts fan count was up 5 million to 98 million globally, driving AOI growth in all of our divisions, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, demonstrating the effectiveness of our flywheel business model.In our Concerts segment, fans continue to find the live experience, from club shows to arenas to festivals, a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artists and share the experience with other fans. In the U.S., over the past five years consumer spending on live entertainment has grown 7% annually, providing strong structural tailwinds to drive increased demand for concerts globally.With these demand dynamics, in 2019, we delivered growth in concerts revenue of 8% and AOI of 7%. This growth was broad-based across our portfolio, with international fan count up 11%, while in North America, arenas, festivals, theaters & clubs contributed to our growth.Globally, festivals, theaters & club attendance were up double digits, highlighting the strength of our global footprint and the value of a diversified portfolio of markets, genres and building types that have enabled our consistent growth over the past several years. And across all of the artists we work with, we invested well over $6 billion to promote 40,000 shows in 42 countries, with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists in music.Average ticket prices for our amphitheater and arena shows are up double digits since 2017, while sales of dynamically-priced Platinum tickets are up 66% for the year across 3,000 shows, as artists want more of the best seats in the house sold at face value at the onsale.Even with these increases, concerts remain a great deal for fans relative to other live experiences. Our average ticket for a concert at any one of our amphitheaters was $46 in 2019, relative to a $75 NBA game over $100 for an NFL game.Once at the show, average per fan spending grew as well. At our amphitheaters, spending grew by $2.50 to over $29 per head, as we improved our product offering, reduced friction with shorter lines, and improved VIP hospitality offerings. The hospitality focus also grew on-site spending at our festivals, theaters & clubs, the result of a better experience for our fans across all our operated venues.We added 38 new venues in 2019, including six new festivals and 18 new theaters & clubs. As we have gotten better at on-site hospitality over the past several years, this opens up more opportunity for us to operate more buildings, where we make more money per fan, which accelerates the on-site monetization part of our flywheel.The strength of our business is continuing with concert tickets sold through mid-February for 2020 shows, up 10% to 38 million, and a pipeline of 4,700 confirmed arena, stadium and amphitheater shows, up 30% from the same time last year. All venue types have strong show count growth, led by North America stadium and arena concerts.In our high-margin sponsorship business, we grew revenue by 17% and AOI by 16% in 2019. Venue sponsorship was a key growth driver in the year, up double digits globally, with broad growth across amphitheaters, festivals, theaters & clubs.Festivals had a particularly strong year. With the addition of Rock in Rio to our portfolio of marquee festivals, sponsorship in this segment was up over 50%. Our top strategic sponsors have also been a key driver of our sponsorship segment, with 88 sponsors collectively spending approximately $400 million to reach our fans, and revenue from this group up 19% in the year.In 2019, we broadened our brand partnership base by leveraging our Power of Live research, with particular success in the lifestyle space working with brands, including Revlon, Vans and Clinique, as we demonstrated the importance of their products to concertgoers.All this reinforces the power of our platform of 98 million fans and the priority of brands to reach fans during the live experience. With over 70% of budgeted sponsorship net revenue for the year committed, and despite 2020 being an off year for Rock in Rio in Brazil, we are confident we will deliver continued growth in our sponsorship segment this year.Ticketmaster further built its leadership position in ticketing in 2019, growing AOI by 11%. Most of our growth came through reduced customer acquisition costs across both primary and secondary ticketing and from secondary ticketing volume, notably the NFL and other sporting events.Our international ticketing business drove our growth in fee-bearing tickets and GTV, led by our strong international concerts ticket sales. We now provide services in 31 countries, and in 2019, delivered 115 million tickets internationally, with tremendous opportunity for continued growth on a global basis, particularly in the 15 markets where we promote concerts and don\u2019t yet have a substantial ticketing operation.Ticketmaster\u2019s recent entry into both the Taiwan and Singapore markets highlights this international expansion opportunity, leveraging our leading concerts position in these markets and now growing our ticketing presence to seven countries in Asia, as we continue to build out our flywheel across more of these markets.In North America, our top priority in 2019 was deploying Presence, our secure ticketing digital product, which we see as key in differentiating Ticketmaster and providing venues, teams and artists with the information and tools to maximize their fan relationships. Presence was deployed in over 700 venues by the end of 2019, including over 90% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, operating 50,000 events for over 120 million fans, more than half of whom used digital tickets for entry.We see our deployment in 2020 further accelerating, and we are planning to have Presence in over 1,300 venues by the end of the year, with over 200 million fans attending events at these buildings. At that point, we will cover 100% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, and 90% of all fans in North American Ticketmaster venues, making Ticketmaster by far the global leader in digital ticketing.Artist-driven initiatives, such as ticketing Pearl Jam\u2019s entire tour with SafeTix, enabling their strategy of getting tickets into the hands of their greatest fans, is one demonstration of how digital ticketing is serving content more effectively. At the same time, we continue to scale our global ticketing marketplace, with the fourth quarter being our second-highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, selling over 60 million fee-bearing tickets and delivering over $5 billion in fee-bearing GTV.Ticketmaster continues to lead the ticketing industry, both operationally and in digital ticketing. Looking at 2020, I\u2019m confident in Ticketmaster\u2019s ability to extend that leadership position globally, as we add more customers, ticket more events and expand our digital ticketing platform.In summary, 2019 was another strong year for Live Nation, building our global concerts business and driving growth in our high-margin venue, sponsorship and ticketing businesses.Looking at 2020, our double-digit fan and show count growth so far this year against a backdrop of very high artist activity across all venue types and markets sets up our flywheel to deliver another year of strong global growth.With this, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. As Michael indicated, fan attendance grew 5% to 98 million fans, demonstrating the strength of our global portfolio and with this demand growth highlighting the strong fundamentals underlying our business.Geographically, international had a strong year with growth in stadiums, festivals and theaters & clubs, driving 11% fan growth. Theaters & clubs globally led fan growth for the year with 20% growth to nearly 30 million fans. Festivals also had a strong year, with seven new festivals, including Rock in Rio helping deliver 13% fan growth globally.Our fan attendance is up from 47 million in 2010, closing out for decade by more than doubling our fan base, the key milestone that demonstrates the consistent and resilient growth at the core of our flywheel, creating significant scale over time.Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, while attendance and show count were up, our AOI was lower, heavily driven by an increase in advertising expense related to 2020 shows, an increased fixed expenses associated with continuing to build our flywheel and operate more venues. Without this higher than projected advertising expense from putting more 2020 shows on sale in 2019, concerts AOI for the year would have been up double digits.Moving on to sponsorship. In 2019, we again delivered double-digit AOI growth, up 16% for the year. International drill over 70% of this growth, with the addition of Rock in Rio helping drive both international and festival sponsorship growth.For the fourth quarter, revenue was up 25% and AOI was up 26%, with growth helped by the second weekend of Rock in Rio Brazil. Our pipeline for 2020 is in good shape, demonstrating the strength of our concerts, flywheel and driving all parts of the business, and we expect to continue growing our sponsorship AOI, despite not having Rock in Rio Brazil this year.Finally, Ticketmaster. Global GTV was flat in the quarter, matching 2018\u2019s record fourth quarter, while fee-bearing GTV was down 2%. North America fee-bearing GTV was flat for the quarter, while international was down 8%, reflecting the geographic shift in 2020 stadiums versus last year. This volume was up relative to our expectations for the quarter, reflecting both the timing shift and an even stronger 2020 pipeline of concerts than was previously projected.For the fourth quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 23%, due to a 9% increase in secondary GTV, reduced customer acquisition costs and the benefit from competing against last year\u2019s costs related to a third-party data bridge. These same factors then drove our margin improvement for the quarter.Looking at 2020, we expect the strong concert slate will drive Ticketmaster\u2019s GTV, including the strong Q1, when we will have most of our stadium and arena on sales. A few more points. The coronavirus has had a lot of press lately, so I wanted to give some context for us.First, as it relates to China and Asia shows generally, show cancellations have been minimal, given our activity levels in China, with 17 shows totaling approximately 75,000 fans. Looking over the next three months, our Asia activity is limited with 70 shows and 200,000 fans in the region.Second, as it relates to Italy, we have 30 shows booked over the next three months, with approximately 125,000 fans. Collectively, this accounts for less than one half of 1% of our 100 million-plus fans we expect to attend our shows this year.More broadly, while we expect that there will be further areas of breakout over the next few months, one of our strengths is that we are highly diversified geographically. Thus far, we have seen no pullback in fan demand or ticket buying outside of this specifically affected areas and overall, our attendance is weighted towards the latter part of this year, with our 70% of our attendance expected from June through the end of the year.Finally, on the OCESA acquisition, we continue to make progress working with the regulators in Mexico on their review. And at this point, we expect the acquisition to close sometime in the second quarter.With that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results. Kathy Willard : Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key highlights for the fourth quarter of 2019 are : revenue increased by 11% to $2.9 billion; AOI was $81 million, up 18%; as of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was up 10% to $1.2 billion, compared to $1.1 billion last year; concerts was the primary driver of revenue growth, as it increased 12% for more fans and shows; sponsorship revenue was up 25%, as we benefited from the second weekend of Rock in Rio Brazil; and ticketing revenue grew 2% as a result of higher secondary ticket volume; AOI was up 18%, driven by growth in sponsorship due to the four days of Rock in Rio and improved resale volume and lower operating cost in ticketing; concerts AOI declined from higher advertising expense for 2020 shows, and increased headcount and rent, primarily related to additional venues.As we\u2019ve noted before, we recognized our show-related advertising for future shows at the end of the year, so the higher volume of on sales for 2020 shows increases our year and expenses.Operating loss for the quarter was $83 million, compared to a loss of $90 million in the prior year as a result of the higher AOI. Net loss for the quarter was $160 million, compared to a net loss of $148 million in the prior year, driven mainly by higher interest, taxes and non-controlling interest expense.For full-year 2019, revenue was $11.5 billion, a 7% increase over 2018. AOI was $943 million, up 14%, and free cash flow adjusted was $499 million, up 4% over last year, representing 53% of AOI due to the timing of distributions to NCI partners.Revenue growth was primarily driven by concerts, which was up 8%, as we saw attendance growth across North America arenas, international stadiums and festivals and theaters & clubs globally. Sponsorship revenue was also strong with 17% growth, driven by Rock in Rio, high demand for our venue on-site sponsorship programs and growth from a number of our strategic sponsors and related spend.All of our segments contributed to our AOI growth. Concerts AOI was up 7%, as we grow our fan base and number of shows across arenas, theaters & clubs and festivals, along with improved fan on-site spend at our amphitheaters, festivals and theaters & clubs. Sponsorship AOI grew by 16%. In ticketing, our largest AOI contributor grew 11%. from higher revenue and lower operating costs.Operating income was $325 million, up 19% over last year, driven by the increase in AOI. Our net income for the full-year was $70 million, compared to $60 million in 2018, due to our improved operating results. Net loss per share was $0.02, after $75 million in accretion of redeemable non-controlling interests. For 2019, we saw a 2% FX impact on both revenue and AOI.Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, we had total cash of $2.5 billion, including $838 million in ticketing client cash and $936 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $697 million.Net cash provided by operating activities was $470 million, compared to $942 million last year, due to the timing of payables and ticket sales versus the prior year. Free cash flow adjusted was $499 million, compared to $481 million last year.Our total capital expenditures were $316 million, 52% of which was spent on revenue-generating items. Our total net debt as of December 2019, after our refinancing in October, was $3.3 billion, with a weighted average cost of 4.2%.Our current expectations for 2020 include : in concerts, we expect most of the AOI growth to come in Q3, with some in Q2 and our seasonally quieter Q1, having a bit less activity than last year. In sponsorship, while we expect growth for the year, the Rock in Rio Brazil, biennial Festival will not occur in 2020.In ticketing, we currently expect this strong concerts slate to drive growth in GTV with higher on-sale activity, particularly in Q1. It is too early in the year for us to predict FX impact for 2020. We will provide guidance in future calls as the year developed. All of our guidance is currently in a constant currency to 2019.We expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million, with the increase largely driven by revenue-generating expenditures. And we currently expect accretion of non-controlling interests to be approximately $55 million for 2020, with about half done in the first quarter and the rest fairly evenly distributed across the remaining quarters.Thank you for joining us today. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Brandon Ross : Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Mike may as well address the elephant in the room right off the bat with corona. And you gave us some really good color on Italy and Asia. Thanks for that. But I think investors want to understand the potential downside risk if there are broader show cancellations, especially over the summer period.To the extent that an individual show is canceled, can you help us understand what the financial impact would be? I know you guys buy many tours outright. I think, you pay artists, like $8 billion per year. Are you left holding the bag if shows are cancelled? And then if there are regions that are affected by corona, do you have the flexibility to reroute tours?And finally, you gave really strong leading indicators for 2020, obviously, shaping up to be a big year without corona. If there is major corona impact, would you anticipate that activity pushing out to 2021? I think that covers most of it. Joe Berchtold : Sure, Brandon, this is Joe. I\u2019ll get started and Michael can jump in. I think the first thing just to put in the right context is your latter point, anything that is being talked about is generally being talked about just in terms of timing, it\u2019s not being talked about not doing the shows, as we\u2019ve long discussed, artists see the touring is the fundamental part of what they do and how they earn their living.So there, we\u2019re not talking any artists. They\u2019re saying they don\u2019t want to be touring. It\u2019s all exactly where can I go when? So it\u2019s just talking about timing. Absolutely, as we look at very specific hotspot, there is certainly flexibility to reroute as need be or to have them come back and hit that area later, as opposed to when was previously planned.In general, we pay the artist when the show occurs. There\u2019s generally force majeure clauses. If for some reason a show were to be canceled, we wouldn\u2019t have to pay the artist. But, again, we think that that\u2019s going to be pretty limited, where we don\u2019t have some ability to either reroute or reschedule. Michael Rapino : And Brandon, a little color on the cancel and the cost. So there will be no cost. We don\u2019t pay an artist until they play. If an artist says, if we cancel a show next month in Milan, we don\u2019t pay the artist. There\u2019s no cost incurred. And when the artist replace that show, then we pay the artist.So these ones are actually the easier ones to manage. I mean, the ones that you always have the more challenges when the festival gets canceled on the Saturday afternoon when 60,000 people are sitting there. That\u2019s when you have a \u2013 some marketing and some sunk costs, where it may affect you.When you have a month, two month, anytime you cancel in advance, there\u2019s actually no cost incurred yet, the artist isn\u2019t at the show, the people aren\u2019t in the venue, you haven\u2019t paid the cost. So this is \u2013 the easiest economic challenge for us is to reroute and reschedule a show no cost to us.As Joe said, the good news is on a supply demand, the show is not going away, it\u2019s just moving to a different quarter. The artist will tour whether they have to jump off this quarter and go in the fall, or 2021, we won\u2019t net lose the business.And the other demand part that we\u2019re just really impressed with, because we always talk about the resilience of the concert fan is, as of last night, we had a sellout in Australia on a festival that went up. The business is real strong. The consumer still seems to be buying the tickets on a global basis.So supply demand will be there. We\u2019re going to take this cautiously as we watch the markets and we assume a hotspot will flare up and a show will be canceled here and there. But we\u2019re confident, long-term, the show will happen. The revenue will flow and the fan will show up.On a macro \u2013 on a micro 2020, as I think Joe mentioned, most of our business doesn\u2019t start till the middle of June onwards. So the next few months, we\u2019ll have some cancellations, I assume, here and there in some arenas and clubs, but the heart of our business happens this summer. And we\u2019re optimistic we hope that it can be handled in the summer months bring us some relief and we\u2019ll business as usual. But right now, we\u2019re being cautious looking at all markets, doing the right thing for the artist. We\u2019re playing along with the great demand of this industry. Brandon Ross : Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll move to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley Benjamin Swinburne : Hey, good afternoon. I wanted to ask if you could help us think about the leading indicators you gave in your press release and on the \u2013 your opening comments, particularly ticket sold up 10% for 2020, 30% growth in confirmed shows. I don\u2019t think you gave specific guidance financially for 2020, which I understand. But just wondering if you could help put those two numbers into context, because they seem quite robust, even relative to the growth you just delivered in 2019?And then, secondly, and apologize for asking more virus macro-related stuff, but I\u2019m sure you understand why. On the sponsorship side, can you just help us remind us how much of that business is sort of, either annual multi-year relationships versus anything show specific? Just so we can think about if one or two sizable shows are postponed if we should see that impact sponsorship as well? Thank you. Michael Rapino : I\u2019ll do sponsorship and then I\u2019ll \u2013 now sponsorship with most of our \u2013 we always talk in our reports about our annual global strategic partners. So most of our contracts are over one to three years, they\u2019re longer-term. They\u2019re not very \u2013 the ones that matter are over multiple events, most \u2013 mostly multiple markets.So we don\u2019t have the beautiful part of our business, which is dispersed over 30,000 shows is we don\u2019t have one weekend, one show, one event, that\u2019s the $20 million big event. It\u2019s really dispersed across the globe, across different venues and genres, which is the parts that makes us a bit risk adverse.So we see no sponsorship risk at all. If a show canceled, the sponsor would get the show later. We\u2019ll make up for the show. Again, going back to our first point, as long as we\u2019re going to deliver a net over the next two years, the same amount of shows, the growth, the tickets that we\u2019ve kind of delivered for that sponsorship commitment, then, we\u2019ll see no pullback at all in the long-term sponsor. Benjamin Swinburne : Thanks, Mike. Michael Rapino : Yes. We\u2019ll talk about the \u2013 yes, we\u2019re headed for a record 2020. Business is strong, and Joe will give you \u2013 what he can on how will even model that. Joe Berchtold : Sure, Ben. As you said, we haven\u2019t tried to give you full-year guidance for a couple of reasons. We don\u2019t generally try to do that in February, it\u2019s a bit early. And secondly, with the uncertainty on the specific timing on the OCESA close, it makes it just harder to give you what the overall year looks like.But we absolutely are taking a lot of confidence based on being so far up in terms of the 30% on the show count. The 10% up on the fans. I think both of those are exactly leading indicators. They\u2019re not projections of where we\u2019re going to end up. But I think, they\u2019re strong indicators that we\u2019ll have pretty good growth this year. Benjamin Swinburne : Thank you. Operator : Next we\u2019ll move on to Khoa Ngo with Jefferies. Khoa Ngo : Hi. Good afternoon, all. Thanks for taking the question. On OCESA, is there anything that you can provide any specifics as to why it\u2019s still being held up with the Mexican government?And then just second question is on a more broader level, there was a big transaction that closed in mid-February with one of your competitors and the multiple seems pretty high. And so if we think about the embedded value in the enterprise, if we apply that multiple just for your Ticketing segment, it seems like you can get the concerts and sponsorship pretty \u2013 at a pretty attractive multiple. Can you just talk broadly of how you think about the value embedded in the broader enterprise? Thank you. Michael Rapino : So let me take the first one on OCESA. I think, when we started this several months ago, one of the things that we thought was that, because OCESA just gone through some reviews by the same government entity that they were very familiar with the business and it would be a fairly quick process.As it ended up, this transaction got put with a different team in a different department. So we had to start a little bit more at the basics in terms of the industry. So we weren\u2019t able to shortcut it as much as we thought. There\u2019s nothing that at this point based on most recent discussions to give us great concern, just taking a bit longer.In terms of the transaction, look, our view is simply that we focus on building a great business at Ticketmaster and throughout all of our different pieces. It\u2019s up to you guys in the market, specifically, value them. We\u2019re building this for long-term value for our shareholders up and down the flywheel and we expect it will be successful in doing that. Khoa Ngo : Thanks very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move next to Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Douglas Arthur : Just going back to cover 2019 for a second. Joe, I\u2019m wondering if you could \u2013 I mean, my concern would be on the festival business in Europe if there was any kind of wider spread beyond Italy, obviously? As you said, most of that is in the summer, so it\u2019s a ways off.But \u2013 and I think five years ago, the festival business in Europe is a big part of your package. I think, it\u2019s less big today as a component, given the growth in other markets. But I\u2019m wondering if you could just sort of size \u2013 sort of frame the size of that business for you, if there was some kind of slow down or less attendance or even the cancellations outright of some of these large festivals over on the continent? Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think that our total festival business would be in that low double-digit portion of our total fan base. And I think our largest single festival would probably be roughly half of a percent of our fan base. So we\u2019re across 100 and change festivals. It\u2019s very diversified geographically, diversified time-wise over multiple continents.So if there were to be a situation still, as we get into July and August, and you assume it\u2019s located geographically. I would not expect that to be a broad impact in terms of our fan count. Douglas Arthur : Okay. And then just one little detail question on the quarter. I kind of asked this question before. But it looks like your event count in North America in the fourth quarter was very high year-over-year and relative to recent quarters. Is that just this continuation of massive growth in small clubs and theaters? Joe Berchtold : Yes, theaters & clubs. That\u2019s \u2013 I think we called out specifically that volume and the growth in my portion on the number of theaters & clubs in the attendance there. So that is what drove most of it in Q4. Douglas Arthur : And then, there\u2019s no acquisitions in there, right, in North America? Michael Rapino : Not a substance. Douglas Arthur : Maybe\u2026. Michael Rapino : Maybe a club released in Philadelphia. Yes, not an acquisition of scale. Douglas Arthur : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll move on to Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Stephen Glagola : Hey, good afternoon. As per the company\u2019s Investor Day presentation in November, you guys highlighted a $60 million ticketing AOI opportunity from entering in new markets with a Live Nation promoter presence. These markets primarily consisted of Latin American/Asian countries, just want to ask in light of Ticketmaster\u2019s recent expansion into Asia, in Taiwan and Singapore. Can you just discuss high level the economics of both the Latin America ticketing and Asia ticketing? How those markets may differ structurally from both the United States and Europe and any incremental challenges in those markets that you may be facing? Thanks. Michael Rapino : You\u2019re well prepared. We\u2019re in \u2013 Asia is less than 0.01% or nothing of our business right now. So it\u2019s not a strong business for us currently. I think I would have said on \u2013 in liberty that on a global basis, we have a lot of opportunity left international and we look at \u2013 we look all across the world from Latin America to South Africa to Asia.We think all those markets in India and et cetera are going to be long-term great markets for us that are \u2013 where we have low market share and are starting to put some shows. So we \u2013 were happy we\u2019ve got a flag in the ground in and Singapore and Taiwan, small little businesses helped to get more flags in the ground over time.And we think in three to five years from now, we hope the Asian business is a big contributor to our overall business, as well as Latin America. But those are emerging markets still very new. Lots of upside, but not to date don\u2019t actually contribute much to the bottom line. Stephen Glagola : All right. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to our speakers for any final or additional comments. Michael Rapino : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you all for your participation.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Live Nation Entertainment's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation of the most comparable GAAP measures in their earnings release. The release, reconciliation and other financial statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website at investors.livenationentertainment.com.It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I hope that everyone out there is healthy and safe. On our last call, we were on track for tremendous growth across all our businesses, with both fan demand and artists touring increasing on a global basis. Then in mid-March, we came to a halt. We have held no concerts in almost 2 months. Despite these challenging times, we continue to have full confidence in the long-term supply and demand of the live concert industry, Live Nation's leadership position and our business model's ability to successfully deliver AOI growth and shareholder value. With that context, let me update you on our top priorities at this point.Our top priority is to ensure the health and safety of our employees, fans and artists. Like most of the world, we have been working remotely since mid-March, and we will return to work only after there is clear consensus that it is safe to do so, and then in appropriate numbers with expanding cleaning and social distancing protocols. Similarly, we recognize the experience that our venues will change when concerts start back up. And we're working with medical experts and public health officials on procedures to keep people safe while enjoying our shows.When we asked over 8,000 fans across North America about the requirements for returning to shows, they had 2 clear priorities, with 85% of fans stating they want increased cleaning and sanitizing of the venues and ready access to hand sanitizing stations, while no other action received more than 40%. In addition, we expect to have additional safety protocols in place, potentially including reduced capacity, touchless concessions and creative ways to apply our digital ticketing technology.Our next priority is planning for the reopening of concerts when the time is right. First and foremost, we will let the facts and science tell us when we should start putting on concerts again. We are working with government at federal and state levels in the U.S. and across all markets in building plans that fit with their reopening phases. In the meantime, we have fortified our balance sheet to have the resources to ramp up quickly when the time is right.We know from fans that demand will be there when the shows return. Globally, over 90% of fans are holding on to their tickets for rescheduled shows when refunds are available. That's the clearest demonstration of pent-up demand that will enable us to quickly start concerts back up.Looking a bit farther out, given that 80% of shows are rescheduled rather than canceled, and as noted, almost all fans are holding on to their tickets, we believe 2021 can return to show volume and fan attendance at levels consistent with what we've seen in recent years.As we plan the resumption of concerts, we're also seeing a number of innovations within our company as artists look to stay connected to fans. Almost 1 million fans have come to our Live at Home site to find virtual tours and acoustic performances from their home. And millions of fans in over 100 different countries have joined Insomniac's Virtual Rave-a-Thons, while drive-in concerts are finding a new purpose to socially-distant concert halls. Throughout all this, we are still motivated by the long-term potential of global live events. It's in the DNA of us to want to gather, socialize and celebrate. And as we provide assurances on health and safety at the venue, we expect our business to build back.Live Nation is in the best position in the live ecosystem to play long and to capture new opportunities, continue leading the industry into the future. I'll now hand the call over to Kathy and Joe, who will provide additional full details on our balance sheet. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the quarter, I want to give a quick update on our cost and cash management programs, which we launched in March. We previously announced initiatives to cut costs by $500 million this year. And we've surpassed that goal and are now targeting $600 million in cost reductions. We've also expanded our cash management program, which including our cost initiatives, now eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash requirements this year. As a result, we project our monthly operational cost burn rate to be approximately $150 million per month for the second quarter and through the remainder of the year.Now I will walk through the impact of the COVID shutdown on each of our businesses during the first quarter. As we previously indicated, at the end of February, we were headed toward delivering Q1 AOI, in line with last year, approximately $115 million. Instead, with the shutdown, we had 100 -- sorry, instead, with the shutdown, we had a $21 million AOI loss for the quarter. The direct COVID impact in the quarter was approximately $165 million, which was partially offset by approximately $30 million in cost savings during the quarter.Starting with concerts. Our concerts division went from $5 million of AOI in the first quarter of last year to a loss of $88 million this year. Through February, we had promoted 5,500 shows for nearly 8 million fans, up year-on-year by 17% and 2%, respectively. We then ended the quarter with 7,100 shows for 10.4 million fans, down 14% and 30%, respectively, from last year. With 2,100 March shows canceled or rescheduled to a future date, we've lost approximately $40 million of anticipated contribution margin on those shows. Additionally, we had a onetime expense of approximately $25 million for sunk cost for canceled shows, which included the cost of paying show employees for those shows that didn't happen during the second half of March. We had always expected our concerts AOI to be down in Q1 given the show activity level and increased fixed costs of approximately $40 million largely associated with acquisitions made over the last year. But unfortunately, the March shutdown led to a substantially lower AOI.On a separate matter, our OCESA acquisition was approved by Mexico's regulators in April. We've now entered into discussions with CIE and Televisa regarding the timing and terms of the previously announced OCESA transaction. And do not expect to close the transaction until we have greater clarity on the duration of the shutdown in Mexico and its impact on OCESA's business.Next, Ticketmaster. Our ticketing division AOI fell from $100 million in the first quarter last year to $45 million this year. Similar to our concerts division, through February, we were on track for a strong Q1 with fee-bearing GTV up 31% to $3.2 billion. Net of refunds, we then ended the quarter with $3.0 billion in fee-bearing GTV, down 22% from Q1 last year. This drastic reduction in fee-bearing GTV led to an approximately $65 million reduction in contribution margin relative to our February forecast for the business. In addition, we refunded 5.2 million tickets for $432 million of GTV during March. And along with an accrual for future refunds of shows canceled in April, this resulted in a $35 million reduction in contribution margin.To give you a little more color on our refunds through this past weekend, Ticketmaster has had 65,000 shows impacted by the virus. Virtually all canceled shows are currently refunding, and about 80% of rescheduled shows or postponed shows are currently offering refunds. For Live Nation concerts, about 9,000 shows have been impacted. Of those shows, about 20% have canceled and 80% are rescheduling. Again, almost all canceled shows are currently refunding. And over 90% of rescheduled shows are offering refunds with the remaining shows scheduled to be refunding in the near future. And as Michael said, less than 10% of fans are taking the refund for the rescheduled or postponed shows when given the choice with over 90% of them holding on to their tickets for a future date.Finally, sponsorship. Our sponsorship business was the least impacted by the March shutdown, losing less than $5 million in contribution margin as a result, and this quarter delivered $47 million in AOI, up from $40 million in the first quarter last year.Overall, we recognize the next few quarters will not be business as usual, so we won't be giving any direction on key operating metrics until we start selling tickets and promoting concerts again. Our focus is on managing our cost structure and cash burn, ensuring a strong balance sheet as we come out of the shutdown. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy. Elizabeth Willard : Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon to everyone joining us. I will briefly recap our first quarter results and provide an update on our liquidity position. For the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue, down 21% compared to last year as the shutdown shows due to COVID-19 reduced our revenue by approximately $435 million, primarily in concerts and also ticketing. Our AOI was a loss of $21 million for the quarter, down $136 million compared to last year driven by approximately $165 million in COVID-related impacts.Our operating loss was $173 million, driven by an estimated $175 million COVID-19 impacts, including $10 million in intangible impairments in the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $185 million, and net loss per share was $0.94.Now on to our balance sheet and liquidity position. We are actively managing our cash to preserve our strong liquidity position during the stoppage in shows. We have taken quick and aggressive actions to conserve cash, including our cost savings initiatives and cash management program, which eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash outflows for 2020 relative to our budget as Joe outlined. In addition to the $600 million in cost savings, these cash impacts include a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and deferrals of concert and ticketing advances. We now estimate an operational cash burn rate of approximately $150 million per month for the rest of the year, prior to interest expense, debt payments, capital expenditures and other nonoperational items.As of March 31, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $817 million. In April, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which suspends our net leverage covenant for the second and third quarters of 2020, replaced with a minimum liquidity test for those quarters. Beginning in Q4 of this year, the net leverage covenant will use the bank-defined EBITDA from Q2 and Q3 of 2019 instead of the Q2 and Q3 2020 results. We continue to have a 20% add-back in that EBITDA calculation, which gives us added protection from our COVID-19 impacts during the period. We also added an incremental revolver of $130 million in April, providing us with additional financial and operational flexibility. That now gives us $963 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. And we will continue to monitor the capital markets for opportunities to expand liquidity at appropriate pricing.Our total cash includes $2 billion of event-related deferred revenue as of March 31. This is part of our operating cash and therefore, provides us additional liquidity. We believe that our free cash balance of $817 million, together with our $963 million of undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations for the remainder of the year, even in the extreme scenario that no major shows play off this year.As of the end of the quarter, our total net debt position was $3.7 billion, with a weighted average cost of 3.9%. We expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants around our corporate debt structure for all of 2020. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million. We are now estimating our full year CapEx to be approximately $200 million, down from our initial estimate at the beginning of the year of $375 million as part of our overall cash flow improvement process. Of the remaining $126 million in CapEx for the year, approximately $50 million is for capitalized labor in our ticketing segment, which we continue to rely on for our ticketing operations, with the remainder largely venue-related long-term projects. We will continue to evaluate all projects as the year progresses, particularly as we gain more insight into opening time lines by region.With that, we'll open it up to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. David Karnovsky : First, Michael, I'd be interested to get your view on the long-term impact of COVID-19. Across a lot of industries right now, there's talk of huge acceleration in consumer trends. So I'm wondering what you think this potentially means for the concerts and ticketing industry. Michael Rapino : Thanks, David. We're looking at all this data ongoing as we're trying to understand and make sure we're looking at a global basis of our consumers and any long-term effects. It was important, we want to make sure we got one of our surveys online today because I think the general surveys aren't always useful, but we went and talk to 10,000 of casual and ongoing ticket buyers around the world. And the data's pretty compelling. I mean 90% of fans are saying, \"I can't wait to get back to the show.\" I think our refund rate says everything. Anyone that has any view that says, will they come back? Will the consumer change behavior? We're running somewhere between a 5% and 10% refund rate right now on a global basis, much lower in Europe.Those aren't out of line with when we reschedule just a traditional tour for different reasons. So 90% of fans in today's environment saying, \"I'm going to hold on to those tickets because I can't wait to see the show,\" I think it's probably the most compelling data one could look at that says the consumer is going to come back strong. It's a big part of their old social DNA to get out and gather and communal experiences with their friends and family.So we don't debate that consumers nor artists will be back on the road from a supply/demand -- I mean, since the early days, people have been gathering around artists. And we think long after we're dead, people will gather around artists. It's a communal primal need. We're just not debating on what month we start that back. So we don't think we have any consumer trends that worry us. This -- there was no acceleration in our industry of a decline. If anything, we were having a global acceleration as emerging markets were becoming more sophisticated and opening up to the traditional concert. So we see that on a global basis that the show will be back. It'll be back as big as ever from a consumer demand.And the second part of our equation that is really unique is the supply. We have all these artists who really look to go on the road for financial and to bond with their fans and build long-term franchises. And talking to those artists on a daily basis, they are waiting to get back on the road when it's safe for them and their fans. So supply/demand dynamics, I think we have a unique situation in the sense of fans are -- cherish those 2 hours when they get on the road and see their favorite performers. The artists want to get back out. Now we're just going to make sure we play the science, and when can we get out there on a safe manner on a scale basis. But we think demand in '21 and onward will be as big as it was in '20 -- or in '19. David Karnovsky : Okay. And I was hoping you could expand a bit on your liquidity position. In a scenario of extended shutdowns, how long can you continue to operate? And what options do you see in terms of additional financing? And maybe as a follow-on to that, what is the right way for investors to view your available cash position, including the deferred revenue portion? Michael Rapino : Joe? Joe Berchtold : Yes. Sure. David, let's start with where we're at, which is $800-and-something million in available cash, $900-and-something million in untapped debt. So $1.7 billion of available untapped liquidity to start with, and then to the point I made of about $150 million a month of operational cash burn. So that says you can go through this year without doing shows at any scale without any concern. I think it's our expectation that even though likely to not have a huge volume of shows this year, as we get into Q4, you start having the ticket sales in some large scale for shows next year.I think we're already seeing -- obviously, the NFL has their schedule announced today or schedule release today. Most of the teams are going on sale with their tickets over the next day or so. So you're already seeing people going on sale even if the shows aren't happening, and that will drive some of our ticketing and sponsorship businesses. But just as the base case, certainly, getting through this year without any additional liquidity isn't a concern. More broadly, when we look at the markets, I think spreads have come back to more normal levels. The capital markets are absolutely open. Open to us, open to a wide range of folks that are looking for any increased liquidity. We'll watch that opportunistically and see what makes sense to do.And then in terms of your question on deferred revenue, I think that, to us, has never historically been part of how we think about our ongoing operational liquidity. I think in this instance, particularly given the very low level of refunds, as Michael went into, it's just some float that in effect we could tap into if, for short- to medium-term purposes, we had a need for that additional liquidity float. It's not part of our base case scenarios in any means. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Benjamin Swinburne : Thanks for all the color on the cash front. Two questions. Michael, could you talk about the sort of operational approach and process of sort of rescheduling all of these events around the world? I mean the complexity, I think, you've talked about in the press is significant. But I'm wondering as you start to go down that path, if you could just spend a few minutes on sort of how you go about doing that and what your opportunities and options are, and how you may or may not be working with other promoters and artists and things along those lines.And then just another cash question on the liability side. You guys have some accrued expenses and accounts payable at the end of the quarter. And I didn't know what we should be thinking about those liabilities, whether or not you need to pay those down over the next couple of quarters. Is there any color you can give us on the accrued expense account payable front? I don't think that's captured in your cash burn number, but I could have that wrong. Michael Rapino : Thank you. Yes, you're right. We have a lot of shows. I mean again, the glass half full here. Thankfully, our show is not time-dependent. So you feel for any other event companies where if you missed the final 4, you can't replay that. So the great advantage we have is it's just now timing. The fan wants to see Billie Eilish. They would have liked to see them in March, but they'll wait until October or they'll wait until February. The average customer goes to 2.5 shows a year. So these are the Kodak moments, and they'll wait for them.So you're right. We're going to -- we're dealing right now as an industry, as a whole, I'd say, like most probably industries. The industry has never come together this well from the agents, the artists, the buildings, the managers, the promoters, we're all in the same boat. So we're all looking to say, how do we move availabilities. Really, the only challenge we've had with availabilities in terms of a little bit of the -- why we had to hang on to the refund strategy is the sports lakes. They're kind of the ones -- we need to understand what's going to happen in the fall time in their arenas, and what availability is and when is the season going to start. Traditionally, the NFL, and the NBA, NHL announce their season, and then we kind of know the next Q4, Q1, Q2 availabilities. That would really be our only gating issue. As soon as they get their exact schedules up, then we'll be able to slot all the dates in.As an industry, we have a great model right now that if you have a current date that was planned, you will get first holds to get that back on the road. And if you're a new tour that was going to tour in '21, you're probably moving that to later in '21 or into '22. So we've talked about it. We think we'll have a very robust '21 backend and really, really robust backend '21, '22. But working together with the industry, we see no issues in moving all of these dates into '21, just waiting on some scheduling conflicts. Elizabeth Willard : And on the accrued liability AP part of that question, I mean, think about, yes, it's obviously built into cash burn. It's also part of when you think about what we're deferring, when we talk about deferring part of our cash, the $1 billion. There will be liabilities that will be sitting there that are accrued that just won't be paid for a while. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Brandon Ross : First, curious how COVID's impacting your commercial agreements with the artists and venues. In the process of rescheduling all these shows, have you been able to renegotiate the contract terms with the artists on guarantees? And as you look to incremental 2021 tours, do the terms of the artist deals look different because of COVID? Are there less guarantees? And then also, what about third-party venues? And then I have a follow-up. Michael Rapino : Thanks, Brandon. As I referred to, as an industry, it's been a unique time where we are all in this together. And I would say that the artists, the agents, the managers have been incredibly supportive. The reality that in '20 and '21, the promoter can't take all the risk on the business as we historically have. We need to share some of that, especially refunds on the guarantees. So I would say to you that we don't want to out loud get into how and what the deals are. I would say to you though that we absolutely are getting great latitude from the artists and agents to look at a traditional business of high guarantees and all of our risk, to help share that risk into '20 and 21, to get the shows back on the road and help us absorb the show, but not take all of the refund sales, sponsorship, food and beverage unknowns for the next 6 to 12 months. They're helping sharing some of that risk which will provide us great opportunity to get back, scale fast, but not have to worry about losing money on the show. Brandon Ross : Great. And you've obviously spent a lot of time looking at your costs searching for near-term savings, but is there an opportunity to reassess your overall cost structure as we come out of the pandemic. Michael Rapino : Yes, I think any CEO, any business operator, it's the great gift of this reality we're in. We're all looking at our business and wondering, now that we have been able to stop, catch our breath and look at our business, are we running the most efficient way we can? How do we restructure our business, our cost basis on a global basis to be more efficient? We have gone into furloughs and cost reductions, as you know. We absolutely plan on coming out of this a leaner machine, much more efficient on how we go to market.And then probably as other companies have learned, there are some areas we're going to have to spend and acquire a better skill set at, to help us diversify our core business in terms of virtual concerts and other things that we've dabbled in, but maybe we got to spend a bit more time in that area. So bottom line is we look at this as a great opportunity on a global basis for us to restructure our cost basis, come out a leaner organization while still as aggressive as ever in terms of our global growth strategy. Brandon Ross : Great. And then maybe one just more technical one for Kathy. You said you expect your debt covenants to be fine all year. If I sit back here and I do the math with limited or no revenue in Q4, it looks to me like -- if we used AOI as a proxy for bank EBITDA, you would still bust the covenant in Q4. Can you just explain what we're missing, maybe it's the 20% add-back that you mentioned earlier? Elizabeth Willard : Yes. I think the two main things, Brandon, would be, yes, you're assuming no material concert activity. But as Joe said, still expecting some ticket sale activity this year and related sponsorship for that. So based on those things, we obviously will not break our covenants based on projections. But I think the other big thing is that 20% because you can take 20% of that bank EBITDA as an add-back for the COVID impacts. And so you can do that for your AOI in the same way and get pretty close. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs. Andrew Borst : A couple of questions. I want to ask firstly about OCESA. I heard the comments about it but I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on what's going on there in terms of -- are you still interested in the asset? Or is this about figuring out a new purchase price, maybe because the performance says they've underperformed in this environment? But maybe you could just add some color on that, please. Michael Rapino : Yes. We're going to -- we've had a long relationship with OCESA and a great relationship helping them on the tour business as they build their business. And we have talked to them about it in the last couple of weeks. It's taken a while to get the government approvals. It happens -- and now in Mexico. But we were -- as you would expect, my line to them has been, we are, long term, still bullish on their business and ours. We want to be in business with OCESA and get the deal done.But we're not sure where Mexico stands. And I'm not looking to take on any losses from Mexico while they're going through their 6 or 8 months of business downturn, will they come up the other side. So ideally, we want to get the deal done. We want to delay the cash payment of the deal until we both know how and when we're on the other side of this crisis. So that's the intent. Andrew Borst : Makes sense. If I could, a couple more. I go through the 10-K, there is a liability that gets mentioned, this redeemable noncontrolling interest puts. In the K, you guys flagged it, at least at the time you expected it might be $238 million sort of obligation. I was wondering if you could just comment on whether that's still a good estimate or are there ways to maybe defer those payments in this environment. Michael Rapino : Yes. Joe, you've been working on that. Joe Berchtold : Yes. Sure. So Drew, some of that we paid in Q1 for some of those puts. And the majority of anything that's still out there that hasn't been paid, we're working to defer out of the year, and that's part of the $1 billion deferral program. So I think you can kind of take all of that together. Andrew Borst : Okay. And then just sorry, one last one... Michael Rapino : But I would add to it. The spirit of it, it's been great. As you can imagine, if you're a partner in a festival, and the festival got canceled, and you happen to have a put up in your deal, we're talking to them about let's delay the put for the year because the event didn't happen and we didn't retain the cash. So we've been very cooperative with our partners. And some of them may need the cash for other reasons, but generally, the partnerships have been very accommodating if their event got moved. Andrew Borst : Okay. And sorry, one last one on -- when I look at your free cash reconciliation, right, from GAAP cash down to free cash, one of the big add-backs is this prepaid expenses, which I think about $450 million at the end of the quarter. I just want to understand what that is because I guess I'm a little bit concerned that, I guess, these are expenses you already paid for events. I don't know what a counterparty is on those and I guess I'm wondering, would it be -- is it feasible to really collect that cash if you need to get it in sort of short order? Or I don't know, can you help me understand what that number is and that risk of collecting? Elizabeth Willard : Yes. So mainly, that's going to be artist advances. And so the best way to think about that is it's an offset to the deferred revenue. So we -- on that free cash, we're deducting off our event-related deferred revenue. And the add-back basically says we're not going to have to pay the artist part of that money because we've already advanced it to them. So it's a good way to net out what really is deferred revenue that might be going out other than our profit. Andrew Borst : I see. So you actually have the cash on. I got you. So it's netted against the deferred, you have the cash in your bank account. Elizabeth Willard : Right. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Khoa Ngo from Jefferies. Khoa Ngo : It's clear that your data suggests there's a lot of pent-up demand to return to concerts. I'm just wondering if you can provide granular detail as to your reopening strategies, particularly spend engagement, artist engagement, and how you can feasibly control capacity in the social business as well. Michael Rapino : Thank you. Yes. Well, one of the things I always remind people on 2 fronts is our global diversity is our greatest strength. It always has been. Wherever there's been challenges, there's been markets of opportunity. So the 2 things to remember about our business, unlike sports or NFL where it's stadiums or nothing, is we have a very diverse size of shows. We did 15,000 club and theater shows last year, and we did them in 40 countries. So we'll look in the next 6 months, but we'll be kind of starting slow and small, focusing on the basics, kind of testing regionally. But it will be about whether it's in Arkansas or a state that is safe, secure and politically is fine to proceed in, we're going to dabble in fan-less concerts with broadcast. We're going to go and reduce capacity shows because we can make the math work.There are a lot of great artists that maybe they can sell an arena out, but they'll do 10 higher-end smaller theaters or clubs. We're seeing lots of artists jumping to get back out when it's safe. So you're going to see us in different countries, whether it's Finland, whether it's Asia, Hong Kong, certain markets are farther ahead. And we kind of look at it as over the next -- over the summer period, there'll be testing happening, whether it's some fan-less concerts, which are really important for our sponsorship business, all the ways we can create great properties to keep all of our sponsors who have been amazing and sticking with us this year. So it's important for us to keep doing drive-in concerts. We're going to test and roll out, which we're having some success with, fan-less concerts, which have great broadcast opportunities; reduce capacity of festival concerts where it could be outdoors, could be in a theater, it could be in a large stadium floor, where there's enough room to be safe.So we have all of these plans in place depending on the market and where the -- that local city may sit in their reopening phases. So we want to be smart. We don't want to rush. We're playing long ball. One of the realities is we and AEG are the 2 companies that can withstand this storm as long as it plays. And we're going to play for the long safety of business. So we're not looking to rush and provoke any new spread of the virus. We want to do it smart with local participation. But there's lots of great opportunities that are arising now where we will get to test over the summer period.And again, I remind you, those are important for my sponsorship business as well as testing the feel on some new ideas we have. We think the fall time, if a lot of those things happen and don't cause any second hot spots, that you'll see markets around the world. Europe specifically has talked about September opening up 5,000-plus. So I think you'll see the fall time more experimental and more shows happening in more of a theater setting and into some arenas. And then our goal is really to be on sale in Q3 and 4 for '21 at full scale, and testing all through the summer.I would say on the venue part that's really interesting, and we're dealing with Federal, White House to every government body, you can imagine. We're jumping on all of the best practices with all the sports leagues, the commissioners, the teams. So we've got a great task force around what have we got to do with the venue to make you safe. And I just think it's very interesting from our data, the fan's not looking for instant testing or thermometers, although those would be fabulous, and we hope those come fast in terms of 5-minute testing. 85% of fans want to make sure our venues are sanitized, enhanced sanitizers available. That's the bar they need to say it's safe to show up. It's the most important factors. So that's also important. We're working with the local governments on what is our venue prep plan, what's the protocol to make the fans feel safe, well for testing. So making sure we have proper sanitization, hand sanitizers, masks, physical distance, cashless concessions. So we've got a full plan in place. We think those are smart things for the future.Digital ticketing is something we've always been driving for a bunch of reasons, but no better time than ever to have digital ticketing and cashless concessions, part of our access program, we're going to continue to excel. I think that will be one of the real advantages of this crisis.So we think we're well on plan on a global basis to have our venues ready. Now we're just going to go market-by-market with one of these or multiple ideas as the market's ready to test these. And that's our plan for the summer, to keep the business moving. Khoa Ngo : Understood. And if I can follow up on that on the pricing side. It does seem like we are moving into a contact-less world going forward. So I'm just wondering, in your latest presentation, you outlined $100 million AOI opportunity. Do you think the current environment allows you to pull that forward in some sort of capacity? Joe Berchtold : This is Joe. Yes, we absolutely think the presence only becomes more important. I think that the magnitude of the opportunity holistically becomes even larger because I think our leadership in technology and the breadth at which we can apply it, as Michael said, it's not just contact-less entry, but cashless payments and other forms have great potential. I think the exact timing of it is still TBD with just a pause that we have going on right now, and we can get it -- when we can get it deployed. But no question, the opportunity is larger than ever. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. And I will now turn the call back over to Michael for any closing remarks. Michael Rapino : No. Be safe, and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference is being recorded. Following management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. Instructions will be given at that time.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Over the past three months, our top priority has been strengthening our financial position to ensure that we have the liquidity and flexibility to get through an extended period with no live events. Our expectation that live events will return at scale is the summer of 2021, with ticket sales ramping up in the quarters leading up to these shows. And partly, we remain confident that fans will return to live events when it is safe to do so. Our strongest indicator of demand is that fans are holding onto their tickets even when given the option of a refund. Through the end of the second quarter, 86% of concert fans are keeping their tickets for rescheduled shows, demonstrating their continued desire to attend concerts in the future despite the current uncertainty. Our expectation for robust outdoor summer season in 2021 are also reinforced by the two-thirds of fans keeping their tickets for canceled festivals so they can go to next year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s show, along with a strong early ticket sales for the festivals in the UK next summer. For example, downloads in the Isle of Wight are pacing well ahead of last year. Between the tickets held by fans for the rescheduled shows and these festival on sales, we have already sold 19 million tickets to more than 4,000 concerts and festivals scheduled for 2021, creating a strong base load of demand that is taking well ahead of this point last year. At the same time, surveys continue to show that concerts remain fans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 highest priority social event when it is safe to gather, with almost 90% of fans globally planning on attending concerts again. Understanding that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be some time before we put on concerts at scale, we are innovating to find new and creative ways to help artists keep fans connected in the meantime. Virtual concerts have proven to be a huge demand with fans, so we established a live from home platform to provide a convenient place for fans of all types to find the performances from their favorite artists. In the second quarter we had 67 million fans see over 18,000 concerts and festivals globally. Among our highlights, the past weekend we streamed 150 performances from our virtual Lollapalooza festival. Given the tremendous popularity of these shows, we are seeing the potential for live streaming to become an additional long-term component of our concert business, allowing fans in other cities or those who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attend to enjoy the concert as well. At the same time, recognizing fans want to get back to attending concerts in person as soon as possible, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve launched socially distant shows when and where permitted, included in New Zealand, France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Finland and as well as cities across the U.S. While this is a challenging time for everyone, the live events business in particular, there are a few things that I am confident about. We are well-positioned to whether this crisis and we will get through this. When it is safe to return, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have an abundance of fan and artists ready to join live music again. And Live Nation will do everything in its power to meet our responsibilities to artists, fans, our employees and everyone else affected by this shutdown by bringing back as much live music as fast as possible when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsible to do so. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our results. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As Michael mentioned, our top property during this time has been strengthening our financial position. And we are confident our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. We have now reduced costs for this year by over $800 million and reduced our cash usage by $1.4 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on operational cash burn rate to $125 million per month and our gross burn rate to $185 million per month on average for the second quarter through the end of the year. At the same time, we raised an additional $1.2 billion, providing us with a $1.8 billion of free cash at the end of the second quarter, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, totaling over $2.7 billion in readily available liquidity. And last week we amended our credit agreement to suspend our maintenance covenant to a more favorable liquidity metric to Q4 of 2021, providing us with added flexibility until business returns. Turning to our Q2 results, starting with AOI. Our AOI for the quarter was a loss of $432 million, driven primarily by operational fixed costs of $334 million, inclusive of approximately $60 million in benefits from various government payroll funding programs. So with our cost initiatives we expect operational fixed costs to average approximate $125 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. We then had negative $98 million in contribution margin, largely driven by one-time events in Ticketmaster and are concerts business. For Ticketmaster, recording refunds for 11 million tickets across 42,000 shows generated a loss of approximately $79 million for our portion of the service fees. In our Concerts business, writing off sunk costs associated with concerts that have been canceled or rescheduled for 2021 generated an expense of approximately $87 million, about two-thirds of which is write-off of advertising expenses given the calendar year shift in show timing. Partially offsetting these expenses, we had $68 million of contribution margin generated by business operations and insurance recoveries for events impacted by the pandemic. Looking at free cash, we ended the first quarter with approximately $820 million in free cash, added $1.2 billion in cash from additional debt during the second quarter and then ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of free cash. This implies $250 million in cash used during the quarter. As part of this, we had a timing benefit to free cash to $415 million which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put back out in Q3 and Q4. Of this timing benefit, $225 million has accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds and $190 million is working capital timing. This puts our total effective cash burn at $665 million for the quarter. The largest one-time impact was the payment of Ticketmaster refunds which totaled $110 million for our portion of service fees refunded to fans during the quarter. We then had our operational cash burn. Starting with our $334 million in operational fixed costs and adding back $54 million of non-cash benefits, our operational cash burn totals $388 million for the quarter. In addition, we had $217 million of ongoing nonoperational cash burn items, including capital expenditures, acquisition activity, net advances and interest payments. These items ran slightly higher for the quarter due to contractually obligated payments for past acquisitions, but we expect this nonoperational component to our cash burn to average approximately $60 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. Finally, we had $50 million of inflows from operations and improved cash management. Lastly, let me give you an update on ticket refunds and how that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impacted our deferred revenue. Ticket refunds first. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 14% through the end of Q2. Festivals have generally canceled this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s events. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s show as Michael mentioned about two-thirds of them are keeping their tickets. Across both concerts and festivals, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve refunded $218 million for rescheduled shows since March. In addition, we have refunded $477 million for canceled shows over this period. Of this $695 million total, $230 million was funds held by third-party venues and $465 million from Live Nation held funds. We still have some shows in the process of rescheduling or are rescheduled but not yet offering refunds. If we apply the same fan behavior and mix on these events, we forecast approximately $270 million in additional fan refunds, of which about $180 million will be from Live Nation held funds. Given this estimate we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shifted these funds from deferred revenue to accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds. Now to look at how these refunds flow through our event-related deferred revenue. At the end of the first quarter, our deferred revenue for events over the next 12 months was $2 billion. At the end of the second quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $941 million. Of this, approximately $1 billion decreased, $405 million was due to a shift from short-term deferred revenue to long-term deferred revenue as a number of concerts were shifted into the second half of 2021. As a result, we have $486 million of long-term deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter of which we estimate approximately $400 million was shipped back to short-term deferred revenue over the course of the year. The Live Nation concert ticket refunds recorded in the quarter then accounted for $465 million, an estimated additional future refunds from Live Nation health cash totaled $180 million. We then had ticket sales in the quarter that generated roughly $30 million in new deferred revenue. Looking at the rest of the year, our forecast for event-related deferred revenue at the end of the year prior to additional ticket sales and based on our projected refund rates is approximately $1.3 billion. Given all the uncertainty in the market and timing of shows, we cannot give you any further guidance beyond these burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. With that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn the call over to Kathy. Elizabeth Willard : Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our second quarter and six months results and provide updates on our balance sheet. All of our results for this quarter and the first six months of the year have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of our shows since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic which is driving all of the variances for both periods in total and across all segments. For the quarter, our revenue was $74 million, compared to $3.2 billion last year, down 98%. AOI was a loss of $432 million for the quarter compared to earnings of $319 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $588 million compared to $172 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the quarter was $568 million compared to net income of $103 million in 2019. For the first six months, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue compared to $4.9 billion last year, down 71%. Most of this revenue in 2020 was driven by our show activity in the first two-and-a-half months of the year prior to the shutdown. AOI was a loss of $452 million for the first six months compared to income of $435 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $761 million compared to $148 million in operating income last year and net loss for the first six months was $752 million compared to net income of $51 million in 2019. Now onto our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $1.8 billion. Our total cash includes $941 million of current event-related deferred revenue as well as $486 million of long-term deferred revenue for events that have been rescheduled more than one year out as of June 30. This is part of our operating cash and therefore provides us additional liquidity. As Joe outlined, we estimate that our actions to conserve cash eliminates or defers approximately $1.4 billion in cash outflows for 2020, which includes the cash portion of our approximately $800 million in cost savings along with the reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and reduce concert and ticketing advances. In May 2020, we issued $1.2 billion principal amount of 6.5% senior secured notes due 2027. As of the end of the quarter, our total debt was $4.9 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.4%. We also have $966 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. Last week we completed an amendment to our credit agreement which amends and further suspends our net leverage coveted until December 31, 2021, if we choose, replacing it with a minimum liquidity test of $500 million, which is measured against our free cash, available debt capacity and up to $250 million of our event-related deferred revenue. We believe that our free cash, together with our undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations until shows return. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million, giving us a total for the six months of $129 million. We are now estimating our full year spend to be approximately $215 million, down from our initial estimate for the year of $375 million. Of the remaining $86 million in capital expenditures for the year, approximately $30 million is for capitalized labor, for updates to our ticketing systems, with the remainder largely venue-related in large term projects.  With that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll open up for questions. Operator? Operator :  And your first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Brandon Ross : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the very detailed prepared remarks. A couple of questions. First, can you tell us how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re approaching on sales for 2021? Should we expect a similar cadence to the typical years? Or are you guys going to take more of a wait-and-see approach, given everything that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on? And I assume in your cash burn guidance that you gave there is no top line in there at all and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re assuming no on sales in 2021. Then I have a follow up. Joe Berchtold : This is Joe. I will start these. In terms of the on sales timing, as we indicated, we expect to be returning to scale with next summer particularly focused on the amphitheaters and the festivals first. So I think that we would expect the usual timing of those on sales, which would typically be for amphitheaters around the end of the year. So we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect for the full year the same; we expect it to be more back half loaded. But we do expect the on sales to be somewhere around a few towards the end of the year and the bulk of them as we get into the first quarter of the year. Second question. In terms of the cash burn, the cash burn is with I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call it relatively limited inflows, more similar to what we have in Q2. So we did have some inflows but not, obviously, at scale or substantial. The cash burn numbers we gave you are assuming the status quo through Q4. And as we move further into it and we have better visibility on Q4, if there is some ramp ups and activity which would give us both increased contribution margin as well as increased costs, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll guide you to that as we get closer. But we thought the more prudent simple thing to do at this point is to give you the status quo. And then as we have more going on, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll increase both sides from there. Brandon Ross : Got it. And then it was widely reported I guess in the rags that you tried to adjust artist terms for festivals and were met with pushback. Can you talk about what happened there and what was the outcome? And as you contract for 2021 shows, have you been able to share your risks with artists at all? And how have contracts been structured differently for 2021 shows and maybe going forward from there? Hello? Michael Rapino : Sorry, Brandon, I had trouble with my mic. Yeah, the press got a hold of a work in progress, which was too bad, because it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meant to be that. We, for a living, are negotiating deals with agents and managers. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the business model. Their job is to look for competition, and our job is to bid on these shows in different terms for different artists in different times. So the process is always fluid. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re obviously trying to do our side of the negotiation and the agents doing their side. This looked, I guess as it got reported, it was just a mid statement. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meant to be anything more than that. But what we really wanted to accomplish was I would just step back and say the industry overall has been amazing dealing with restructuring 2020 into 2021. The agents, the managers and all the artists all have been very cooperative, that understand that if you had a show this year and you wanted to reschedule next year, some compromise in the terms would have to be met. And the biggest risk we all had on the promoting side that we wanted to make sure we could incorporate was the refunds. Now the refunds, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, have been surprisingly really strong on the concert side. And we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what we were going to head into an we started renegotiating. But we do know on festivals refund rates are much higher because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bigger cash outlet, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also just a bigger time commitment. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tend to be as local as your average concert. So wanted to make sure going to 2021, if you are a headline artist that was going to play a certain festival this year and we wanted -- and you still wanted to play it next year, the two things we wanted to make sure that we were protected in and that we both shared some of the risk was a refund reduction and insurance. Those are the two principles, if you take all the drama from the press, aside those are the two things we wanted to make sure that we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stuck paying the same price in 2020 if we had a 31% refund rate on a festival. Now if those tickets all sold back through and that festival ended up at the same place it was in 2020 then we should all share the upside. And every agent and artist and manager have been incredibly accommodating to all the promotors in the business who are all looking for some help in terms of rescheduling next year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shows and taking in refund and insurance, and making sure we are clear on those two terms. So that was the net result of it all. The rest was a wish list of things as we head into any negotiation. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d all like to win, but those are the two points that made sense that were most important for our business and for the festival P&Ls. Brandon Ross : What about for shows that are in 2021 that were not pushed from 2020? Are those contracts being structured differently than historical deals? Michael Rapino : Well, I would say that what the industry did in general overall is every show you basically had you had the chance to cancel it. Right. Every show basically was canceled in some sense. Not to our doing. So everyone was in the same boat. You were all starting with a clean slate. So I would say to you if you had a tour that was on sale and it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doing well, you and the artist decided to pull it down and not go forward with it regardless of COVID. So any tour that you reschedule, you have the opportunity to look at that deal and at that show and at the number of dates, et cetera, and negotiate with the agent and manager and the artist on what was the best go-forward strategy. So anything -- we talk about 2021 is going to be a spectacular year in the sense of the stuff that did get pushed you can guarantee was all of the stuff that was selling well and high demand. So that stuff is all going to -- those shows will still be continuing next year. We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything really on sale for 2021 ahead of our 2020 season of any substance. Ninety-five percent of what we are dealing with was 2020 reschedule to 2021 shows. Brandon Ross : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. David Karnovsky : Hi. Thank you. When you look at planned 2021 concert season, can you talk about how it might look coming back in terms of venues? And you all mentioned before, focus on maybe the amphitheater footprint initially, so how much can you lean into your amphs? And can you book artists there that might otherwise played an arena or stadium? Michael Rapino : I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start and then Joe will jump in. I mean, first, you think about our business. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 50% international, 50% America, so a lot of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing is what were going to happen outside of America versus here. The summer season in international is the heartbeat of their business festivals, from small outdoor shows to larger festivals. So Europe will already continue what they do well. Most of their business will be outdoors. The summer season here, we do have the advantage of our 50 amphitheaters and we think those are going to be high utilization next summer, as well as our boutique festivals. So, yes, we would be looking right now at the business as a strong amphitheater festival outdoor business in Europe and into America, and then most of your touring indoor stuff will start to ramp up in the fall into winter. Joe Berchtold : Yeah, I agree. The only thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d add is I think this is a place where our having, our managing a large number of buildings really is going to come to our advantage. So the fact that we have these 50 amphitheaters we can manage the process with the buildings and we have all of that activity outdoor, the same for the festivals where we have the leases on the land and we can operate them. And then even the hundred plus clubs and theaters that we have as one would expect that some of the lower volume number of people gathering will happen sooner than some of the large gathering indoor because we have those buildings, because we can manage the processes with them. I think that will let us ramp up faster than otherwise we would be able to. David Karnovsky : Okay. Then I think earlier you did mention some international regions with concerts being done at limited capacity. I mean, are there other countries or markets where you operate where you think you can get to some level of scale prior to summer 2021 at this point? Joe Berchtold : Yeah, I mean, we definitely, we all see that news, the U.S. looks like the one that will be the longest but the other markets, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Australia, New Zealand, Denmark Germany, Finland, some of those markets, they all seem to be moving along on a good forward path. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a very structured plan in place and when small shows can start, they seem to be moving towards those timelines. So although we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about a spring return to business outdoors we do actually operate in 40 different countries expect certain markets especially from theater up unto clubs and into arenas to be happening in some of those markets before the spring. David Karnovsky : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Ben Swinburne : Hey. Good evening or good afternoon. Michael, can you go a little bit more about artist appetite to get back on the road in this environment? I know a lot are either postponing releasing new music or at least some have. Others, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure, are trying to be sensitive to the economic pressures that their fans are seeing. What are you hearing from artists that you have relations with around getting back on the road sooner rather than later? And maybe a similar question for you on their, decision process on canceling versus postponing, I think there been some who have decided to cancel in order to help their fans get their money back faster. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if that was something that you thought would grow as the year progressed. And then I just had a follow up on the deferred revenue point. Michael Rapino : Yeah, I think it was our last earnings call we were showing you some statistics to make sure that everyone understood that touring had not had a structural change. There was a debate back then whether fans would gather when they got out of this. I think if anything we learned in three months, we got to figure out how they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gather short-term so we can have better business faster. I would just say to you that we have been really, really, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to play long on this one, so we have artists with lots of ideas on shows they could do now. We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be doing DJ sets in The Hamptons anytime soon. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to play along and play safe. So the artist, you nailed it. I was talking to an artist this morning. I think as you read elsewhere, I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see a creative boom. I saw the record label this week also down slightly because they need new releases and touring to happen to keep the machine moving. So yeah, I think 2021 you have artists that are all just keep calling me daily saying, when can I go? When\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it going to be safe? When are we going to go? I am dying to go. I got new music. I want to drop new music. So I think this is why we believe long-term regardless of what quarter we exactly scale at, the business will be stronger than ever with the creative push by all these artists who need to get on the road to drive their new music. So 2021, 2022, we can debate what quarter exactly ramps but we believe 2021 into 2022 will be record years with artists on the road who are pent-up. They need to get on the road economically and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now powered by crates of backlog and they are all waiting. I talked to an artist this morning. They were going to release in November. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to wait until March now so they can coincide with the tour schedule later in the year in 2021. So huge demand. We are very gifted in this industry and that we have incredible supply chain, a lot of ongoing creative geniuses who make their living connecting with fans on the road. So that will continue, and we know now from all of the craziness we have seen across America, the fans are going to gather. We just got to make sure we can do it safely. As far as canceling and postponing, one of the things we decided really early on was to make sure that we offered refunds on postponed events also. We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want deferred revenue to have any false narrative to it. We still are leading the industry. There are many companies that are not giving refunds, even ones that got government money. But we believe that you need to offer the fans refunds for postponed and cancel shows, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done that. So we believe our actual number when we talk about fans holding on, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real. We make it very easy for you to get a refund right now at Ticketmaster if you go look at our site versus others. We even see a concerts sold at Ticketmaster versus other ticket sites, the take rate is higher at Ticketmaster, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very easy to get a refund. I believe that the refund numbers are true, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not suppressed in any manner on our business because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re offering both options. And if you see an artist that canceled versus postponed, it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be because he wants his fan to get money back. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve offered both those options for any tour. It may just be an artist that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to go, was going to go on the road, probably an older artist looking at it saying, maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to run back and try to figure out if May is going to happen right now; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take a year off. So you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen some of those ones that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just wait. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a younger artist tied to more record releases, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably really still waiting and ready to go probably a little earlier, given your demo. Ben Swinburne : Got it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful. And then just deferred on the revenue. Thank you for all the detail. I may be confused. Deferred revenue for events, I think, at the end of the quarter was about $940 million. And I think you said you thought it would be $1.3 billion at the end of the year. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously the higher number, which is sort of counterintuitive, given there is some refund activity expected. I think, Joe, you said that did not include any benefit from on sales. So what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the reconciling item? Or did I just maybe mishear you? Joe Berchtold : Yes. So you heard the numbers right, Ben. Two things. One is, as part of that $941 million, that includes $180 million of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve modeled out as additional refunds that we expect to happen. Because we are able to model it, we needed to ship that out of deferred revenue. If our model were perfect, then that would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already been taken out. And the second is when we use the term deferred revenue, it is with regards to deferred revenue for events taking place over the next 12 months. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been an important nuance in the past because deferred revenue for things over a year ago has tended to be pretty small. But in this case, because we deferred a lot of shows into the second half of 2021, we have about $400 million of long-term deferred revenue that will flip into deferred revenue over the next six months. So your 900 plus 400 equals the $1.3 billion rough numbers. Ben Swinburne : Got it. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all be experts on this by the end of the year hopefully. Thanks for your help. Joe Berchtold : And then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start selling more tickets to confuse you deferred. We look forward to that day. Ben Swinburne : Thanks. Operator :  And you do have a question in queue from Khoa Ngo with Jeffries. Khoa Ngo : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. If you can just focus a little bit on M&A opportunities, and obviously, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of distress out there. So I want to be sensitive and cognizant with the question. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just wondering what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in terms of opportunities to consolidate and what your general appetite is to pursue those opportunities. Michael Rapino : Well, I think we mentioned it last time. I think we look on a global basis as we continue to look to build our global market share. And we believe that over the next 24 months there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be ongoing opportunities for us to expand our global footprints in foreign and international markets that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve have been looking to get into and build some businesses around. So, yes, we do think that over time this will provide us some opportunity in international markets. Khoa Ngo : Understood. And if I can just pivot a little bit towards your cost cuts. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve clearly made a lot of progress. I believe the numbers were around $500 million pre-1Q, and then 1Q was about $600 million and now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at $800 million. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just wondering of that $800 million how much of that you think is more structural, more permanent going forward. Michael Rapino : Yeah, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to give you exact number. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been going through this process, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been looking at our fundamental cost structure and we do expect that we will come out of this with some different organizational structures, a bit leaner, bit tighter in terms of how we do some things. So we will have some savings. How much of that, right, you expect to see more of that in 2021 is a year that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ramping back up; and then as your continuing to grow getting into 2022 and beyond, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re then reinvesting some portion of that. But over the next quarter or two, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give more definitive numbers on that. Khoa Ngo : Understood. Thanks very much. Michael Rapino : But to give you color, I would add the only gift to when you slow down to this level that you have not had since we launched this company 15 years ago is you build up your own bureaucracy and your own rust 15 years in. And we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had the luxuries or opportunity to sit back division by division and look under every rock and challenge ourselves on how are we going to go to market differently? What are some new products we need to go to market with, and how are going to operate more efficiently on a global basis? So I would say the part that does motivate me daily is Joe and I and our teams probably have never felt so energized around what Live Nation 3.0 will look like heading into 2021. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- our main obsession isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just to sit still but to come out of this looking and feeling different. Khoa Ngo : Thanks very much for the color Michael Rapino : Will hit -- which obviously will add efficiencies to our ongoing cost structure as well. Operator : Your final question comes from Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Stephen Glagola : Hi. If we look at the phase 3 openings across the U.S. and internationally, concerts that are still being put on in various international countries and cities for the most part are at pretty reduced capacities. What gives you confidence that the governments will allow live events to return to scale in the summer of 2021? And can you maybe define like when you say back to scale, is that 75% capacity, 50% capacity in your amsen  festivals or full capacity, if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the expectation. That would be great. And then you talk on the press release like the potential revenue opportunity or -- sorry -- streaming, excuse me -- as being an additional long-term component of the concert business. Could you maybe speak to that as a potential additional new revenue opportunity? And any other adjacent products or services you guys may be able to offer during this difficult time to bring in some incremental revenue? Thanks. Michael Rapino : All right. Let me -- go ahead. Joe Berchtold : I will start on streaming then work backwards. Yeah. I think we have a natural advantage in the streaming business in the sense we have studios call these events. And 300 festivals and 10,000 theater and club shows alone, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been great at the physical execution but they do provide incredible digital opportunities that we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t focused enough on. So I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re deep at work in biz devev  department and I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see some new products from us in the new year that we think are complements to our core business. But great additions. We also have such a huge sponsorship base, when you have 900 sponsors. Adding Live from Home alone has been a big part of helping deliver some benchmarks as well as drive-in concerts and some of the reduced capacity, although not perfect on their own, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been great tools to provide sponsors with some value. So I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see us launch some new products that we think will be a great complement to our core business. As far as the confidence on getting back to business, Joe, you and I were just discussing that so you could take the lead. Joe Berchtold : Sure. So first of all, to answer your question on what we mean by scale? To us, scale our normal business model in the summer, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be doing several thousand concerts a quarter for tens of millions of fans. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to try to predict right now the exactness. Is it 70%? Is it 90%? What percent of last year is it? But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in that type of volume. So why do we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen? A couple of things. First of all, I think the efforts on the vaccine front are moving faster than anyone predicted three or four months ago if you listen to the experts. The Dr. Faucis of the world and what are they saying in terms of their expectations where you have multiple different vaccines with multiple different approaches and their belief that something is going to happen by the end of the year is one of the vectors that gives you some comfort. The other is the progress being made on the treatments. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve obviously as a medical community learned a huge amount over the past four months in terms of the basic treatment, in terms of perhaps the potential of antibody treatments, the use of other drugs, remdesivir and others, in terms of helping to reduce the mortality rate of it. So overall in terms of as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked bringing about the facts and the science lead us, we have been pleasantly surprised thus far on the progress of vaccines, probably some of the testing and tracing has been slower but still now is ramping up so between the testing, tracing, the treatment also providing opportunity. So amongst those I think we believe sitting here today that the facts would say that by the beginning of the year you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to put on the tickets. The tickets on sale we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to do the shows next summer. And then for the reasons that we have talked about, we have a high degree of comfort that demand is going to be there. 86% of the people keeping their tickets to the shows, two-thirds of the people keeping their tickets for festivals that were canceled this year, put out canceled but still saying they wanted to go to the show next year instead of getting their refund. So in total over 19 million tickets for 4,000 shows that have already been sold which that alone, well, we have already sold for 2021 would make us one of the largest promoters in the world. So all those factors together I think is what gives us the comfort. Stephen Glagola : Thanks, John and Michael, and pardon the long-winded questions, but if I could just slip one more and just on, could you discuss the viability of independent venue owners in this environment if then used to close down or go bankrupt? How do you anticipate that impacting the concerts business and also Ticketmaster you think will reopen? Michael Rapino : I would just say on the Ticketmaster front, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a global business with a very, very diverse portfolio less on the small venue side on a macro level. So it would have limited effect there. Ticketmaster, at the end of the day has very large sports business on a global basis and big venues which is a big part of its business and then large concerts. So don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see it there, any effect there. I would say that looks like in most of the countries, maybe the U.S. now, this ongoing stimulus programs in effect and that seem to be coming to life for the live business in general, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the employees, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the venues, small or big. So I would assume some of them would have continued ongoing support through government programs to keep them afloat through this time. Listen, we are all in the same boat. We are all looking to figure out how to get through the downtime and reduce costs, and I think they are banding together, and hopefully, they will find their support systems also. Operator : And there are no further questions in queue at this time. Michael Rapino : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference is being recorded. Following management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. Instructions will be given at that time. Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ including statements related to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SEC filings including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most recent filings on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risk and uncertainties that could impact the actual results.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. There're been no major changes in our business conditions or outlook since the last time we spoke. And while we see signs of promise around the world with some live events return. Most regions we operate in continue to have various restrictions unlike this. For now we continue to maintain a strong cash management discipline while planning for the ramp up to resume live shows as soon as possible. Joe will have a further update on costs and cash management efforts later in the call. We also continue to see strong fan demand across the board. Our sales and survey data tell us fan demand will be there when the time is right. Our refund rate on reschedule shows remain consistently low with 83% of fans globally keeping their tickets. A recent global survey indicates that 95% of fans are planning to return to live events when restrictions are lifted, the highest point of confidence since the start of the pandemic. Festival on sales for next year have been strong with EDC Las Vegas 2021 selling out in 24 hours with a higher capacity than last year. And ticket sales for Red and Greenfields and other White festivals pacing ahead of last year. And we encouraged by the enthusiasm for recent events and gatherings that have started to take place including our first sold out tour with 20,000 fans in New Zealand where business is headed back to normal. Meanwhile, we are working on a roadmap to get back to live safely. We are encouraged by progress on testing technology treatments and vaccines which will help us build our plans. We still expect shows at scale next summer but recognize that some exact timeline of this return will vary by region and so we continue to focus on remaining flexible. In preparation there are two areas we are focusing on. On the technology front, Ticketmaster is creating the tools we need to make sure live events can deliver a variety of safe precautions when returning. New products such as our social distancing seat mapping tool and time entry technology have been created to give venues the flexibility to plan how to manage everything from venue access to box office interactions. Existing products including our safe text digital ticket technology can fulfill new needs including being a key facilitator for contact tracing. And the ability to integrate third party applications with our digital ticketing platform enable the range of customizable features from contact list with concessions to testing and health questionnaire tracking. On the content front, Live Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developing a set of standards for executing shows that our vendors. We are collaborating with health experts to develop show guidelines to put in place procedures, which can adapt to various situations across all regions. From venue sanitation procedures to fan friendly policies and on ticket purchases and the latest testing options, we are setting standards that will give the fans, crews and artists peace of mind before, during and after the show. If we look ahead it is through the past to Live will not be a straight one. With as such, we will maintain flexibility and focus on innovating during these times. On November 19th at our Investor event, we will outline more detail the opportunities we see emerging for our business. With that, I'll turn over to Joe. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael. Good afternoon, everyone. We've added some additional tables to the back of our earnings release, so this quarter I will hit the key numbers as opposed to reconciling in every number as I did last quarter. As Michael noted, we've continued to strengthen our financial position during the third quarter and all the key numbers are in line with or better than what we forecast last quarter. As a result, we are confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. As part of this, we have further reduced all discretionary spending by another approximately $100 million and have now lowered to us for this year by over $900 million and reduce our cash usage by $1.5 billion relative to our pre-COVID plants. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on our operational cash burn rate to $110 million per month and our gross burn rate to $175 million per month on average for the last nine months of the year and prior to the benefit of contribution margin generated by the business. Included in our gross burn estimate is approximately $40 million in severance expense estimated through year-end which we expect to generate over $200 million in annual run rate savings. Our free cash at the end of the third quarter is $951 million and along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, we have $1.9 billion in readily available liquidity. At the same time refund rates for Q3 remain low at 17% globally. As a result deferred revenue is at $1.4 billion as of the end of Q3. And we have increased our forecast than what we expect at the end of the year now $1.4 billion. Turning to our Q3 results starting with AOI, our AOI loss for the quarter was $319 million which consisted of $337 million in operational cash burn, $50 million in other non-cash fixed costs and $68 million of contribution margin, which included $73 million from operations along with other one-time items. One point to note here is that this same from operations includes our sponsorship business where we've been able to maintain 90% of the commitments that were in place at the end of February. The bulk of this sponsorship moved into 2021, but some of it was repurposed into other assets including streaming concerts. Looking at free cash we ended the third quarter with $951 million in free cash compared to $1.8 billion at the end of Q2 in line with what we expected and consistent with what we told you last quarter. This translates to an $821 million reduction in our free cash metric for the quarter. Part of this, we had a reduction in free cash of $333 million due to working capital timing, which is part of the $415 million flip we told you last quarter would be happening in Q3 and Q4. We expect the remaining $80 million of this timing impact will affect free cash in Q4. The majority of this timing shift resulted from show scheduled for Q3 of 2021 shifting from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue. So it is an accounting shift as opposed to actually use of cash. As a result, our total effective cash burn was $488 million for the quarter or approximately $160 million per month, which aligns with our gross cash burn net of contribution margin generated in the quarter. Now ticket refunds, as I indicated, the global refund rate for Live Nation Concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 17% through the end of Q3. Festivals have generally canceled this year's event. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year's show 63% of fans are doing so and keeping their tickets. A bit more detail on deferred revenue, which is tracking ahead of where we told you last quarter we were going to be. At the end of the third quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $1.4 billion. Of the $421 million increase, $383 million was due to a shift from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue for concerts rescheduled Q3 of 2021. At the end of the third quarter, we still had $103 million of long-term deferred revenue most of which equipped to short term deferred revenue by the end of the year. Given this, along with the projected Q4 outflow of $74 million from additional ticket refunds, we now forecast deferred revenue of $1.4 billion at the end of the year prior to any additional ticket sales. Given the uncertainty in the market on timing of shows returning, we cannot give any more guidance beyond the burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. With that, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open the call for any questions for Michael, Kathy, or me. Operator :  Thank you. And your first question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. David Karnovsky : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just recognizing that 2021 may be a fairly unique year in terms of how concerts and festivals are structured. But when you look at 2022 which is the long term general, are you confident that the general economics that drove the concerts industry will return or should investors expect some sort of change as it pertains to relationships with artists, the venues or really on any front? Joe Berchtold : I think the baseline economics the promoter the artist the venue those economics will not materially change structurally going forward. I think what you'll see and we've hit a few points is as we've spent this time continuing to think about our business, we've looked at how it is. We can take some costs out. And I give you some numbers on over $200 million in reduced run rate. And we've also spent our time thinking about just how does each piece of the flywheel operate a bit better going forward. And how do we keep thinking about new ways to drive the overall economics of the business. But I don't see any change in the core historical dynamics on the key players. David Karnovsky : Okay. And then just to follow-up on the $200 million should we think of that as permanent cost savings or some of that comes back when the industry begins to scale up again? Joe Berchtold : I think as we look at 2021 we expect to see those savings to be largely in place and then 2022 is we've got to wait and see exactly what the scale is. The 2022 is as big as we think it could -- then we'll see what costs are needed. But we think that the bulk of this flows through the business and there is a structural savings. David Karnovsky : And then maybe just to ask one a little bit long-term in nature. You know an area that's got a little bit more attention lately is virtual concerts. I just wondering if you could update your views on the opportunities to the Live Nation either as it pertains to selling incremental virtual access to your shows or just continuing to stage your own productions like you've done recently with Live From Home? Thanks. Michael Rapino : Thank you. It's Michael. We believe that virtual is a great complement to the car business. You know there's going to be always beyond says in BTS and Billie Eilish of the world can probably do like the old school pay per view if you think of it that way. There's always a few global superstars that probably can go direct and drive some significant dollars. But generally this business we think is a complement to and a promotion to their core concert. So we think it's a great opportunity. Listen we've been dabbling in virtual for years whether it was streaming through Twitter and Yahoo and stream and ourselves for sponsors. We've been streaming our festivals on YouTube for years. We now look at that as a continuation of that and we think going into 2021 and 2022 will be streaming a lot more of our concerts to fans that maybe either can't show up at the event or some that may want to still stream on our app when they're at the event because there's some added value of digital backrooms or camera angles et cetera. So we think it's a great compliment helps us probably drive a few incremental dollars per show and also as always been a great tool for sponsorship fulfillment. Operator : Your next question is from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Brandon Ross : Hey guys. What I really want to know is who won Georgia. But short of that wanted to take a step back on Ticketmaster with Jerd's departure you promoted your head of international who's that actually based abroad. Is there anything to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 hello? Is there anything to read into that? Is international a bigger focus and more broadly maybe if you could discuss the strategic priorities that Ticketmaster under the new leadership. Michael Rapino : Thanks Brandon. You know there's nothing to read. This is like everyone is probably saying COVID excelled any strategy you had in our case while we've been sitting tight, we've been able to do a bunch of restructuring and really thinking of the business. But we had planned over the next three years that we were able to do in the last three months. So going global on Ticketmaster was always the number one priority. We always knew that our greatest opportunity for you know kind of the TAM on Ticketmaster is going to be outside of the US. It's an incredible powerful brand. We've expanded into markets where Live Nation has content. It's an allocation market. So as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re concerts grow, you can feed your ticketing business. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a huge opportunity. We haven't been successful at getting the global technology architecture excelled as fast as we wanted. The US is always such a big kind of drag on resources when we're running at full steam that we always get that projects get slightly pushed back to solve the latest US technology need. This is one let us excel the strategy that says we're going to now have one global technology stack a much better efficient architecture around it, common global products that we can roll out at once and help excel our international expansion. So I myself am the product when I moved from Toronto to London and lived there for five years. I think it was the single reason Live Nation is what it is today. And Place Global is when you see from the outside in all the opportunity it gets you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it gets you thinking differently. So I believe that the fastest way we would grow Ticketmaster to a global brand was let someone from the global side who's working that what business every day take the reins and drive that product. So we're even working with Mark for years and they've been having a product strategy to get there. We just excelled the leadership team to do it now. Sorry go ahead. Brandon Ross : Go ahead. No, you go ahead. Michael Rapino : Yeah. I think the priorities haven't changed when we get back to business they're going to continually be about, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got an incredible two businesses that Ticketmaster were at the core were enterprise platform, white labeling teams and venues all around the world. So whether it's the NFL or the Phoenix Suns or ultimately artists were great software platform to power your ticket needs. And we're going to get better at better at that in terms of our do it yourself and white label in and empowering artists and venues and teams to deliver their ticketing needs. It's been a great kind of test platform is the virtual business. We've overnight had to become a virtual ticketing company at scale across the globe and we've been able to do that. We are powering through our portfolio all of these virtual shows and selling tickets to them. So that's been what we do at our core. And then two we've always talked about being a better marketplace making sure that the marketplace the approximately, making sure that we have full inventory on the shelves, adding more inventory to the shelves. Whether it's Ticketmaster clients or not being a true marketplace where consumers can find tickets buy them stock the shelves through secondary third-party partners adding more content to the shelves, that is the strategy. So this does take that global and those two core strategies continue. We've got lots of clients to service on a global basis. We're underserviced \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in under markets shared in many markets where our concepts are strong. And we're rolling out our global marketplace best-in-class practices across our global marketplaces that are sitting on old platforms. Brandon Ross : Great. And then a few weeks ago Marc Geiger had announced his Save Life Club roll-off wondering what impact if any. You think he can have on the industry with that? Michael Rapino : The same one he had at William Morris. But I think that there's a lot of talk on the independent venues save our stages et cetera. And there's no doubt everyone in live service providers and companies are having a rough year. We've been being very focused on making sure that the 12 million employees in Live from the hairdresser to the lighting crew to the security guards are get some stimulus and help. We think those people are in the most need. So, we've been very vocal about that. When it gets to the venues in general the thesis out there with Mark Geiger and some others is that these independent venues are so distressed that they're going to throw someone the keys at a very cheap price and you can maybe roll up some of these cheaply and have some scale. Well, the thesis is basically broken at the first point is any great Live club is not throwing anybody in the keys cheaply. There's a lot of capital out there. So if you on the Troubadour in Los Angeles, it's a legendary business and you're having a tough year. You're not selling to Mark Geiger or anyone else, if one or two time multiple your access to capital PPE loans lots of ways you can keep your business afloat, while you get through the storm. So we don't think that there's a huge opportunity that that there's a fire sale happening at that level. Now number two as you know we -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the -- we have a consolidation of clubs in our business. Clubs on their own are a tough business, if you scale them up on their own. They're not -- they're not a really, really fruitful business on their own. So, we like them as part of our -- our overall ecosystem. But we're -- we don't believe that clubs whether you own 10, or whether you own 20 of them on their own provides you much global synergy or US synergy to leverage off of. So we hope all of these clubs find their way through this pandemic like we -- we hope all Live service providers find their way through this and that the government and stimulus programs and can help them survive it. But we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably many that are going to fire to anybody, because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too many great options for them. Operator : Your next question in queue is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Ben Swinburne : Thanks. Good afternoon. First Michael just what are you hearing from artists and artist managements on getting back out. And I'm specifically wondering, what's your best guess in terms of timing when we start to see major tours announced that eventually and tickets put on sale at \u00e2\u0080\u009cat scale\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was wondering what your latest crystal ball tells you. Michael Rapino : Well, the important part is the demand there and the supplies there as we know, right. So that's obviously what we're playing for. So we know that the fans still are going to get to the show and we know the artists want to get back on the road when it's safe. And depending whether you're \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what age you are as an artist you may have a different timeline and risk factor. But many artists that we're talking to are just waiting. As we all are looking on a week by week basis to figure out when is there a plan in place when they can start looking to get on the road. So we've been always talking to artists about if you have a 2022 or moved into 2021 for the summer into the fall. Let's hold on to that. Let's see how the next few months go through testing and vaccines and in a proper national plan et cetera. And we're telling any artist that has a new tour that's thinking of going on the road. Let's look at the fall, but we don't need to make those decisions until January, February. So if you have a new if you have a new tour well let's think about the fall into 2022 but let's sit tight until January before you start moving any costs in place to get ready. So that's kind of a -- that the general sense is let's -- let's reset, let's get through 2021 summer with whatever we reschedules from 2020, add new stuff into the fall to 2022 as we get a better visibility into January. Ben Swinburne : That makes sense. Are there any insurance-related issues that you guys are having to work through, you know beside the festivals or any large events or do you think that's pretty well baked at this point? Michael Rapino : You're talking about insurance on the historical what's happened to us this year? Ben Swinburne : No, I mean more is you know we obviously see like in film production, the studios have to do are dealing with more and more \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Michael Rapino : Yeah. Ben Swinburne : Health-related protection and insurance frankly from having to shut down. Just wondering, if that's impacting your business at all? Michael Rapino : Well, because we're just talking about as Michael just said really summer of getting back to scale. I think first of all we remain optimistic that the government here in the US like many of them internationally if sorted out and made sure that there's not spurious liability from everybody doing the appropriate actions. And then that's why we've got the programs in place and what we're doing is we're working with the public health officials in every market to figure out what is it that there needs to be done for those markets to bring fans back safely as we get to next summer. And I think it's our expectation that as long as we're doing that that we're going to be in a fine position. Ben Swinburne : Got it. And Joe if I could just ask you one to try to help us think through the fourth quarter use of cash and I know your looking forward to that question. Is there any way to think about the contribution margin that we might see in Q4 versus what you saw in Q3? If that seems to go in one area that might help you know benefit the cash burn number? Joe Berchtold : Yeah, really I can say is that I don't think Q2 and Q3 were that different from each other. Obviously some different pieces moving around, but they weren't wildly different. And I've given you the cash burn numbers operational and growth for nine months. So you can pretty easily do the calc on what that leaves over for Q4. Ben Swinburne : Okay, thanks a lot. And Joe you mentioned the sponsorship already. Joe Berchtold : Yeah, 90% of our sponsorship commitments that we had as of the end of February have stayed in place. They've stayed in 2020 where possible and that's what's driven some of the CM that we had this quarter in particular with most of the rest of it rolling into next year. Ben Swinburne : That's great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz, your line is open. Mr. Katz, your line is on mute. We'll move on to the next question. Your next in queue is from Doug Arthur with Hebert Research. Doug Arthur : Yes. So I guess is the question for Michael or Joe. Based on all the costs that you have had to sort of take out to slow the burn. Is it fair to conclude that when business gets back to normal and obviously there'll be a surge of activity at some point that the underlying inherent margins of this company particularly on the concert segment may be higher on a longer term basis based on the kinds of rationalizations you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done the things you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found sort of added necessity. I mean, will there be structural change on a permanent basis? Joe Berchtold : Yeah. This is Joe. I'll start. The answer is yes. That's the over $200 million of cost savings from the severance that I talked about that we said will be out for the pursuable future. So that piece of it is out and then we'll manage bringing the other costs obviously as slowly as possible as needed to ramp up as we get into next year. Michael Rapino : And just to add -- I just want to add to that one of the things I want to make sure we're -- it's not just about severance we've had a time to reengineer. So one of the strengths is like everyone's learned that that is a new tool for all of us is the work from home strategy. We were very decentralized organization with lots of offices from Tampa Bay to Cleveland. And we're now learning what everyone is learning. We can shut down a lot of those regional offices. We can have a work from home strategy. We can reduce our office burn, our monthly burn, and have a much more flexible workforce too. So work from home a decentralized service model like ours has been an incredible new gift to figure out how can we now restructure and still deliver the same volume without some of the costs. We've also reengineered where we need offices and how we can have a regional model versus maybe a local at times. So between reengineering and work from home, our goal has been both at Ticketmaster, Live Nation and globally to run at a $200 million annual run rate reduction on our fixed costs. That's our goal right now and into a full wrap up. Doug Arthur : And just sort of following up on Ben's question on artists and maybe this is probably  but as things start to come back and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of demand for artists to get down the road there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably some scheduling issues, do you think artist management teams will be more flexible on payouts particularly if you're restricted in terms of how many seats you can sell out initially in an amphitheater what have you. Are your conversations indicating flexibility on that side of the equation? Michael Rapino : Yeah, 100%. I mean everyone has been affected by this understands the world's going to start differently. And it's going to require a slower ramp up. So we see it already and you see the driving shows. We're doing the social distance shows in Atlanta the rocks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Roxy on the weekend where we have maybe 20% to 40% attendance depending on the state. Those are all adjusted artist guarantees based on the capacity, so 100% the artist will be coming back to work and adjusting their expectations to the realities of the capacity as we all as an industry start to scale up from 25% to 100% eventually. Operator : And we have David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Very good. Thank you. Look I given the considerable financial endurance and the limited visibility around the trajectory of this recovery. I just wanted to hear your thoughts or perspectives about any sources of capital or any capital rising at this point. Joe Berchtold : This is Joe. I think we don't see it as necessary at this point as we gave you a pretty detailed numbers on the burn. Current \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and our current debt capacity in cash. We think that we've got enough to get us through until we ramp backup. Also remember that a lot of the cash starts flowing back into the business months before the shows themselves start because you've got the concerts going on sale, which generates the cash in the Ticketmaster and into sponsorship. So we think that will take us through this period until we can get ramp back up. At the same time, we know the same thing that you and everybody else knows is that there is tremendous liquidity out in the market should at some point that the need arise. But we just don't see it at this point. Operator :  Your next question in queue is from Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Stephen Glagola : Hi. Has the pandemic accelerated the shift for event organizers to utilize your digital ticketing technology and I just going back to the prior question on the Ticketmaster changes moving to the global tech stack et cetera. Do you expect these changes to push ticketing structural margins above that 29%, 30% threshold when business conditions normalize? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : So first of all on digital ticketing I think Michael spoke to the streaming and the fact that we see streaming has been a very interesting complement to our business going forward and we think it makes sense it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an additional point of revenue for the artists and for the overall ecosystem. And when they do a show they can also stream it for fans in other markets who can't get to the sold out show and so on. So the ability to provide that digital ticket along with traditional tickets and do  more important and something we're doing right now. So no question on that and then in terms of TM team going forward and the globalization. Again Michael spoke to and we've given you some of the numbers on the cost reduction obviously a chunk of that is associated with Ticketmaster and how we think about driving that on a globalized platform and taking some of the rust and inefficiencies that might have existed in accelerating bringing that all together. I don't think we're going to give you specific numbers here today, but we certainly see overall some further reductions in the cost structure. Stephen Glagola : All right. Appreciate that John. Just one more if I can. Obviously most people are you're seeing most people hold onto their tickets for shows that have been postponed. How many times can you move a show before you expect to see sort of the ticket buying public to give up on the show and demand a refund or you just cancel altogether? I believe maybe you might have moved them once or twice right now. If you do three or four times does that get into a situation where you just end up canceling altogether? Joe Berchtold : Yeah. Look as Michael said the fundamental supply and demand dynamics have not changed. Artists want to tour. They need to tour for their livelihood. Fans want those tickets. You know six months ago we had a lot of folks saying no, no refunds in the 80%. Everybody's going to want their money back. Nobody's going to want. And that's proven fundamentally wrong. We're sitting at 17% six months later a fraction of what I think almost everybody was saying. And so we remain very confident that there's not going to be an exact formula. But fans who were able to get a good ticket for an artist they want to go to they're going to want to go to that show as soon as they possibly can whenever that is. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone. My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator on today's call. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainment's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.  Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in their earnings release. The release, reconciliation and other financial and statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website at investors.livenationentertainment.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As we look back on 2020, it is clearly not the year anyone predicted, but I'm very proud of how Live Nation has dug in and focused on turning this challenge into an opportunity to improve our business. I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their resilience and creativity and acknowledge all of those affected by COVID and the shutdown of live events. Over the last year, leaders across all of our business lines, Concerts, Ticketing and Sponsorship, have been analyzing ways to improve their business. Some of the key initiatives include reorganizing to become more nimble while also reducing our cost structure by $200 million; building concert streaming and direct-to-consumer businesses to expand our revenue streams; advancing our technology initiatives globally while accelerating the shift to digital tickets to meet changing needs of fans, venues and artists; and reinforcing our balance sheet to endure this period while maintaining a strong position to build our business for the future and act on opportunities as we identify them such as our recent acquisition of the streaming platform, Veeps; and continued pipeline bolt-on acquisitions throughout the globe. So, while this past year has been challenging for the company, our employees, fans, artists, and so many others globally impacted by COVID, I've never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us. We continue to have a substantial tailwind in the live event industry as consumers, more than ever, are looking to spend on experiences. The supply-demand fundamentals of the concert business remained strong with artists ready to get back on the road and fans eager to reconnect at events. All our data continues to show that there is substantial pent-up demand for concerts on the consumer demand side. The $2.4 trillion projected surplus in savings in the U.S. alone by June is a key indicator of consumer spending potential. At the same time, surveys demonstrate the high demand for concerts globally with 95% of fans likely to attend a show when restrictions are lifted. This is proving out in fan behavior as well with 83% of fans continuing to hold on to their tickets with rescheduled shows. On the artist side, there's a broad desire to get back on stage to connect with their fans and provide economic support to their bands, crew, and hundreds of others employed each night putting on the show. Given the limited touring activity in 2020 and '21, the pipeline for 2022 is much stronger than usual with almost twice as many major touring artists on cycle in 2022 in a typical year, about 45 artists versus the usual 25, and there remains plenty of scheduling availability at arenas, amphitheaters, and stadiums to accommodate these additional tours with over 2/3 of these venue nights unused by sporting events or major concerts in a typical year. It appears that the timing to release the pent-up supply and demand is now approaching. Vaccine distribution is accelerating and declines in COVID cases throughout most of the world gives us even more confidence that a safe and meaningful return to shows will soon be possible. For both the U.S. and U.K., projections indicate that everyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by May or June in Europe and most other markets following a few months later. Given the mass social and economic toll the lockdown has put on the public, we believe there will be strong momentum to reopen society swiftly as soon as vaccines are readily available, and we believe outdoor activity will be the first to happen. So, while the timing of return to live will continue to vary across global markets, every sign points to beginning safely in many countries sometime this summer and scaling further from there. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our financial results. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we did for Q3, we've added some additional tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to on the call. For the fourth quarter, all the key costs and cash numbers are in line with or better than what we forecasted last quarter. As a result, we are confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. As part of this, we further reduced discretionary spending by another $50 million and closed 2020 with over $950 million in lower costs. We also reduced our cash usage by $1.65 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans, $150 million more than we were projecting last quarter. Looking at our Q4 AOI results, our AOI loss for the quarter was $244 million, which consisted of $290 million in operational fixed costs and $46 million of contribution margin, which included $96 million contribution from operations along with various one-time items. As we pointed out last quarter, this contribution margin from operations includes our sponsorship business where we've been able to maintain close to 90% of the commitments that were in place at the end of February last year. Half of this sponsorship moved into 2021 while the portion we retained in 2020 was repurposed into other assets, including streaming concerts. Our artist management and merchandise businesses also generated positive contribution margin in the quarter. Looking at free cash and liquidity, we ended the fourth quarter with $643 million in free cash, which increased to $1.1 billion in early January with our debt raise. This, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity gives us $2 billion in readily available liquidity. Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $308 million or $103 million per month. We had $97 million per month average in operational burn plus another $44 million per month of nonoperational cash costs to get us to $142 million average per month in gross burn. And then we had $39 million per month in cash contribution margin and ended up with a total effective cash burn of $103 million per month. Now ticket refunds. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window or windows was unchanged from the prior quarter at 17% through the end of Q4. For the tours that have gone through a second refund window, the refund levels were generally much lower for the second window as the casual fans requested their refunds during the first window. Festivals  generally canceled their 2020 events. But for festivals where fans could retain their tickets for next year's show, 63% of fans are doing so. On deferred revenue, at the end of the fourth quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $1.5 billion versus the $1.4 billion we projected at the end of Q3, higher due to $100 million in ticket sales during the quarter. Finally, our 2021 outlook. We won't be giving a multi-quarter outlook given the uncertainty on specific timing and likely varied timing for different markets around the world. For Q1, we will remain focused on our cash burn rate and particularly managing our total effective burn rate to ensure cash contribution margin growth outstrips any increases in our cost structure as we start to ramp back up. With that, let's open up the call for any questions for Michael, Kathy or me. Operator? Operator :  Your first question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. David Karnovsky : Michael, for the U.S. and U.K. markets, can you expand a bit on what you think we'll see this summer in terms of concerts? Can you get back the whole tours and some major festivals or do you sort of envision operating in a more kind of smaller regional basis? And then as a follow-up, I'd be interested to understand how artists are approaching the decision on when the right time to get back on the road is. Michael Rapino : Yes. I think this summer, we're going to see a bit of a regional model -- a module model. Every day, we seem to have a new state or country talking about when they'll open up. So we're feeling more optimistic than we were a month ago. Lots of artists are calling and looking at how we start up in July, August, September, maybe move things a month. So for right now, we still believe that we'll have enough open throughout the U.K., Australia, Canada, U.S., to keep what we have on the books and the amphitheater booked for now. We might have some certain states that might not be ready, but we have enough states, we think, and enough artists willing to play the open slots if we get to that level in the right markets. So right now, we think we have enough artists. And as long as these states open up to the right capacities, we can start mid-summer into Southern U.S. We could go all the way to November. Joe Berchtold : And then -- this is Joe. The only thing I would add is, if you look at the U.K. as a model, I think what they've laid out is a series of thresholds and timelines to reopen and really get almost fully  June has been very helpful and has really created a big burst of consumer demand over this week. And as a result, if you look at our U.K. festivals in August, Creamfields has already sold out. Reading & Leeds saw a huge jump in consumer demand, and those are both likely to be sold out this weekend. So, we do see that in the U.K. with the help of  we're going to be able to get those festivals to happen certainly in August. David Karnovsky : Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on that point, assuming kind of conditions start to normalize faster than expected. Can you maybe just say how much lead time you need to ramp-up activities at your various venue types? And are there kind of acts that you can lean on to fill supply in short notice? Michael Rapino : Yes. We're running about a 3-month lead time. So, we've been talking to our global employees about that kind of timeline, when we kind of have the first show at scale that we think is going to happen beyond 50%. three months back from that is when we can start bringing back marketing production, all of the key venue functions. So, everyone is eager, employees to get back out, and we can wrap up in between the on sale or the announcement and the actual show with no challenges. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Stephen Glagola : Earlier this month, Ticketmaster rolled out its new live stream product and you purchased the Veeps platform as well a month ago. The online live market appears to be a more nascent market. Could you discuss how you expect this business to impact the P&L in '21? Maybe high level, just the economics of ticketing virtual events, how that compares to sort of ticketing a regular live show? And how Ticketmaster is positioned in this market relative to the competition? Michael Rapino : Right. We look at it -- obviously, we have to solve two different problems. Live Nation looks to be in this space because we think, as I've said before, it's a great complement to our core physical product. We're still not sure if this is a business or a feature, but we think we've been streaming our live shows from Yahoo! Live to Twitter. We stream most of our festivals for many years on YouTube and other platforms. So, streaming a festival or streaming a live show for a sponsor or for other platforms, we've been doing that a long time. This is just now an opportunity with Veeps to do some of that direct-to-consumer on the club shows, amphitheater, festival shows that we think will have that added capacity and demand that will help increase some of the revenue for the artist. So, we think it's kind of like a T-shirt and merchandise in a VIP platform. It's another incremental revenue stream to the current physical show. We think we have a unique advantage because we have the sort of 30,000 physical shows. So, when we're putting those on sale, just like today, we try to sell you an upgrade, VIP package or a T-shirt, for those that can't come to the show -- but possibly even if you come to the show and you want some -- to look at some other camera angles on your phone, we think it's a good complement or an add-on to our physical show. Ticketmaster just wanted to make sure this is a new product. Whether it's like festivals or clubs, we wanted to make sure that they had the capability to service events and clients coming to them saying, \"Hey, I have a virtual show going on sale. Can you ticket it for me since you have such a large database and the -- then the scale and competency?\" So we're proud that, that team in COVID was able to take some existing software and quickly ramp up and has been able to service many shows around the globe because that's kind of instantly a global product when you're putting a virtual show on sale. So, we think Ticketmaster will probably be one of the leaders in that space. Most of the platforms or most of the live shows you've seen have come to Ticketmaster and said, \"We'd love you to ticket it. You have the capability, and you have the marketing reach that we don't.\" So that's been successful to date. Same business model, it's a service fee model. Most of the platforms you see out there are charging a service fee on the ticket, and that's what Ticketmaster is also doing, and that seems to be the accepted model to date. So, we think it's another product in the channel or their portfolio that Ticketmaster can effectively deliver for the customer. How big of this segment, this ultimately is in the end. I think it continues or will be -- -- once like it's been on YouTube, it's always been an interesting way for a customer to see some of the live show. History says that live show though, thanks to Tiktok and Instagram, is not consumed in mass. Most people don't want to watch two hours of their favorite band. They want to find that one great shot on Tiktok. So, we're still not sure how big of a business a live show is, but it's something that is incremental to our course. So, we'll be on it, same with Ticketmaster. Stephen Glagola : Michael, that was really helpful. And maybe one more for just Joe and Kathy. On your -- you guided total CapEx to $150 million in '21. It's down 30% or so from '20 levels. Down, I think, over 40% from 2017 to '19 levels. The '17 and '19 was a really significant CapEx ramp period for the business. Is the '21 CapEx moderation or deceleration is something we should expect going forward as we look out to some of the outer years, '22 and beyond? Joe Berchtold : This is Joe. I'll start. I think 2021 CapEx is more a reflection of the fact that we're continuing to be prudent in our cash management this year. I think as we get back to '22, we spend CapEx based on the opportunities we see. We continue to see great opportunities on the concert side in terms of going into new markets, adding new venues, continuing to build out that business. So you'll see that accelerate, ramp back up in '22 along with continuing to find ways to invest in the venues that we have to get a fan throughout that portfolio. Operator :  Your next question is from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Brandon Ross : A couple of questions. First, I wanted to ask a follow-up on David's question, leading off about reopening. And Michael, you tweeted out earlier an article about the Reading & Leeds Festivals being set to take place this summer. They're large-scale events. Can you describe some of the safety plans that are being contemplated for those? And whether they're meaningful in terms of cost? And kind of how you see the fan experience looking when we open festivals like that? Michael Rapino : I'm going to let Joe handle the safety part. I'm going to come back to the sales on that one, though. Joe Berchtold : Just in terms of the -- in terms of the protocols, number one, obviously, we have some additional cleaning protocols that are in place. Those are not a -- those are not a huge cost. And then one of the big changes is the shift to much more contactless. So as we get the digital ticket really fully implemented and out there, the ability to have contactless interest -- entry, contactless purchase of food and beverage, contactless purchase of merch, all of that is going to improve the fan experience, provide some safety and comfort to the fans, and I think only be a better overall experience. Michael Rapino : And Brandon, just because you brought it up, just to show you when we keep talking about pent-up demand. Reading & Leeds went on sale, thanks to the government-outlined new plan for the summer, and sold 100,000 tickets in 72 hours. Creamfields went on sale and sold out in 48 hours, over 70,000. So we are seeing the fan and what we've been talking about, they are excited to get back to the show as soon as we get the green lights in these markets to open up. Brandon Ross : Great. And you gave some details around the Ticketmaster globalization initiative a few months back at the Liberty Day. I wanted to unpack that a little further. Can you maybe describe the overall margin opportunity for ticketing? Is it a business that as this globalization effort is implemented, can make Ticketmaster have a more typical marketplace margin structure? And then maybe describe how long the process will take and whether we're going to see continuous benefits as it plays out. Joe Berchtold : This is Joe, Brandon. I'll start that by getting into some of the numbers. I think part of this is in that -- the $200 million cost reduction that we told you was going to take place. Ticketmaster is a large portion of that. Ticketmaster's cost or, I guess, their revenue was about $1.5 billion in 2019. So if you apply a good chunk of the cost savings to that, you get mid-single-digit margin expansion from that cost savings off the bat. We expect that, over time, as we get even more efficient, more globalized than the Ticketmaster platform, there will be some additional savings. But as importantly, it will let us go into new markets faster. And also, when we add new capabilities in the U.S., those can be instantly rolled out worldwide. So we'll be able to drive revenue along with the reduced cost. Brandon Ross : Cool. And then just finally, as things reopen and you come out of the pandemic fairly levered, I wanted to ask your early thinking on capital allocation. If there are international assets at attractive prices out there, would that take precedent over delevering? And how do you balance the opportunities that may present themselves abroad as you continue that international roll-up versus sort of a leverage target? Joe Berchtold : This is Joe. I'll start. I think that we're very comfortable with the leverage that we're at now. We are not in a rush to delever. We think it will naturally happen over time given the performance levels that we think are going to be happening starting in 2022. So we remain, as we said, in a very liquid state, around $2 billion of total liquidity, including untapped debt right now. We don't think the vast majority of that will be necessary this year. So it gives us a lot of dry powder as we look at our global set of opportunities and bolt-on acquisitions. Michael Rapino : And Brandon, to pick up on that. As you've seen us over the last 10 years, this space, on a global basis, tends to be a lot of small bolt-ons. So we've been ramping up our 100-plus million customers, doubled it over the last few years, and we'll continue to grow those numbers. But we don't have to make $1 billion acquisitions to make any of that come to life. We were talking the $20 million range is a lot of where we pick up a festival, a venue, a promoter that's accretive and in a key market for us. So we'll continue to be acquisitive on our theater, club, global business, any markets we think there's opportunities that arise given where the world sits today. So we will be aggressive on a bolt-on, continued consolidation path while we are able to. We think '22 is a peak year, which lets us start taking a lot of free cash flow and start working towards delevering also. So we think we can accomplish both as we have over the years. Operator :  We do have a question from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital. Paul Golding : So Michael, you talked about the 3-month lead time on possibly a 50% capacity show. I guess when we think about the recent news in New York around the 10% arena capacity limit now being allowed, how should we think about how artists are sort of phasing back in? You've had peers say that, that just isn't enough for financial reasons to justify an event. How should we think about sort of that breakeven where artists may decide to get out there early if states start opening up even earlier? Michael Rapino : Well, I think you look at the U.K. and Australia as kind of the key markets, right, where they went from -- once COVID and they had the right game plan. They have now set a clear date when 100% capacity can happen outdoor, then it's kind of business as usual. So we have not, as to date, done a lot of work in the 0 to 50% capacity business. We don't see that as a viable model to ramp back up fixed cost. So we think we're close enough though where we are with COVID and with all the governors in the states we're talking to, that there will be a clear outline to a 75% to 100% outdoor green light in '21. So we think we're better off waiting for a high bar capacity moment in most of the states to ramp up and talk to the artists about getting paid properly. So we think that's within sight and is better -- is closer than having to dabble in the 10% and 20s, but those are great steps forward. Paul Golding : Great. And then with the downtime, have you seen maybe a broader set of venues more aggressively roll out components of the SafeTix or Presence platform in venue? Joe Berchtold : This is Joe. Obviously, during the shutdown, most of the venues have been shut down as well. So there hasn't been a lot of specific rollout during the time as much as there is a massive sign-up of venues that are looking to shift to a paperless digital ticketing going forward. And for those that have already adopted digital ticketing to some extent, looking to expand it and really having it be the way that entry takes place. Paul Golding : So maybe some pent-up rollout demand when things reopen so that you can roll out quickly? Joe Berchtold : Yes. Yes. Operator : And there are no further questions in queue at this time. Management, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing or additional remarks. Michael Rapino : All right. Thank you, everyone. Stay safe, and we'll talk to you on our next earnings call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone. My name is Hector, and I will be your conference operator on today's call. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainment's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Following management's prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. Instructions will be given at that time. Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the Company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the Company's most recent filings on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. When we spoke last in February, I was optimistic that we will soon be returning to live events, and since then, our confidence has increased for our key markets. In the US, over 40% of the population received at least one vaccine dose, and most states are now fully or partially reopening with more restrictions being lifted daily. In the UK, over 50% of the population has received at least one vaccine dose and their reopening roadmap is tracking to plan. And although Europe remains a few months behind on vaccinations, they are progressing and recent discussions about reopening to international visitors this summer are encouraging. Around the world, people are showing the need to get out and socialize once again, which reinforces our expectation that a return to concerts will be the logical progression as vaccines are readily available to everyone who wants one. This is generally already in the case in the US, where we are confidently planning our reopenings, particularly front door shows, and we expect other major markets will follow this summer. Alongside these trends, we are seeing the effects of significant pent-up demand as fans are buying tickets and events are selling out faster than ever. In the US, Bonnaroo, Electric Daisy and Rolling Loud festivals all sold out in record times at full capacity. In the UK, we have 11 festivals planned this summer, including our largest ones Reading, Leeds and Parklife where tickets are already sold out. New Zealand, the country's largest festival, Rhythm and Vines quickly sold out. And as we get further clarity on reopening timelines, we are announcing more tours for late this summer, including Dave Matthews, Luke Bryan, Maroon 5 and others to come, showing artists' increasing confidence in performing this summer. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we have done over the past few quarters, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release, to reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. For the first quarter, all the key cost and cash numbers improved relative to Q4 2020 and are at or better than what we expected at the start of the quarter. We remain confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increased liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until we bring shows back, which will begin to scale in key markets outdoor this summer. As we move toward reopening, we continue to balance strong cost and cash management. We are now making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect the second quarter to be our first year-on-year improvement since Q4 of 2019, and to also be generating positive AOI through the second half of the year, we still plan on reducing costs this year by $750 million and reducing cash spend by $1.5 billion, relative to pre-pandemic plans. Michael Rapino : Before taking questions, I wanted to cover one other thing. Kathy Willard, our CFO for the past 15 years will be retiring as of June 30. She will be than staying on as an advisor throughout the end of the year. As of July 1, the plan is for Joe Berchtold to become CFO. Kathy as you know has been an invaluable part of our executive team for the past 15 years and been with Live Nation for over 20. We are a much stronger company because of her, not just from her role as CFO, but as a champion for women at the company and the industry, an important adviser to me on a range of issues. Because she built such an effective finance organization, I'm confident we will remain in good shape as Joe steps in. He and Kathy have been working together closely for over a decade now and he has gotten more deeply involved over the past year, as we have been planning this transition. In addition, late last year we elevated Jackie Beato, EVP of Operations to take on greater responsibility and give Joe the bandwidth he will need for the job. More than anything, I want to thank Kathy for her impact on the Company, her commitment and her friendship. Operator, let's open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. David Karnovsky : I'm going to a question.  And Kathy, if you're on the call, good luck and you'll will be missed. And I guess with regards to the summer, early fall, Michael or Joe, can you provide a sense for how much is booked at this point relative to a normal year in the US or UK? And just given the lead time, how much room do you have still kind of ramp that higher shoot conditions improve further from here? Joe Berchtold : Yes. This is Joe. David, I'd say that the summer and early fall, next three to four months is largely booked. We obviously have a lot that is shifted from last year into this year. We've added some tours so we've also added a number of festivals, all of which have been selling well. So the typical ramp show is probably a couple of months' lead time, so I think we'll still have room to be adding more as we get into August and September, but the majority has been booked at this point. David Karnovsky : Okay. And then, can you maybe just expand a bit on the reviews following landscape over the next 12 to 18 months given all the supply that's built on? How do you expect to kind of efficiently allocated out all the tours? Are there any capacity constraints, not necessarily in terms of venues, but just in terms of maybe like the weekend nights that are available? Joe Berchtold : Yes. We're currently in that good position. We have lots of great conversations with probably every artist you can imagine, talking about when they're going to be back on the road. And artist typically tours once every three years on a cycle, so we're kind of condensing 2021 and '22. So the good news is we've got incredible supply and now we're just sorting through what makes sense to go out in '20 -- at the end of '21 still -- into '22, and some artists were talking about moving into '23. So I would say, the artists are patient and they're smart in terms of what their cycle is predicting, maybe they have a record coming out in the fall, maybe it's in Q1. So right now, we have a great supply. We don't have any issues in terms of availability. But we're also not looking to cram everything in three years into one year. We're looking to stage a good '22 into '23 year. So when you spread it over those two years, you find enough Fridays and enough weekends and enough routing challenges come to be solved that way. David Karnovsky : Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in. I guess this Concerts activity is now ramping up, can you maybe just discuss a little bit about what the process has been for Live Nation? What are you finding you can do it differently versus prior to the pandemic? And maybe just what your overall confidence level is in hitting your prior target for structural cost savings? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Yes. We're very confident we're going to hit the structural $200 million cost savings we given you. As we've talked about, we've done it the opposite way, which is we took $950 million of cost out, and so now it's a matter of how we let $750 million of costs back in over a period of time. So that gives us -- that makes it more real if you will. We've done a number of things. On the Ticketing side, we've talked about, we've shifted that to a truly global organization as part of moving into a true single approach on the marketplace, on the enterprise and on all the technology. On the Concert side, we have a longstanding local network, which is very important to continue to understand the markets. So the 80% of your shows now booked to be tours, you don't need to have an entire infrastructure in every local market. So we've been seeing that there are ways of streamlining it and when we were growing double-digits every year through most of the last decade, it wasn't worth the potential disruption. But as we've stopped, we've asked ourselves, what's the best way to do this rebuilding from the ground up. And we're very confident, it's going to deliver those savings and be an even more effective organization for driving future growth. David Karnovsky : Thank you. Michael Rapino : And just to add to Joe, I think there's two ways to look at the business. We got -- we had a great workout, testing a new muscle for the last 12 months in terms of our balance sheet, our fixed costs and how we can become more efficient. And I think that you're going to see come to life through our $200 million-plus. But I think the real win of the downtime was what is the new products of the kind of Live Nation 3.0? What else are we going to do with this incredible scale we have across our consumer base? So I would say whether it's Sponsorship, Concerts or Ticketmaster, we would have a new level of new products in the pipe that we had not historically had the time, nor the skill set to kind of unlock. So I'm very confident over the next couple of years, we're going to see some exciting new things coming out of the Concert division. Our consumer side of the business -- our Subscription business, our Ticketmaster business, our new Ad business models we're looking at. So a bunch of exciting ideas now finally had months and months to put some people around and skill set that we've acquired to advance that part of our business. So, we look at the future is not only can we run the largest concert company in the world more efficiently and the best at it, but also what other new products will drive our business to think differently about the customer and the artist. David Karnovsky : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Ross : Hello. Just -- I guess you just mentioned Live Nation 3.0, so figured I take it web 3.0. And you earlier mentioned the digital ticket and the ability to now integrates blockchain. I was wondering if you could help us understand what the extra advantages are to utilizing the blockchain versus your current version of the digital ticket? And maybe how heavy of a lift that is for you and what tactic plan to use? Michael Rapino : Thanks, Brandon. It's a great question. We got asked it every day and I read a new article every day on all the great things it's going to solve. So let's step back in blockchain, we think it's a very exciting technology. We're currently using blockchain technology in our products. We've invested in this business for a few years now and we think it's a great technology that will help our business. I would step back from what are the problems that we're trying to solve or what are the opportunities that blockchain specifically brings to the Ticketing business. One of the great advantages in the industry is when we went from a TDF to a digital ticket, we unlocked a lot of what you keep reading about the blockchain is going to do in the future. So the digital ticket or your mobile ticket that you are now buying has solved the biggest problem that unlocked we've been talking about this for two years Identity. Identity for us, the fan, the artist, the team and the venue knowing who sits on that seat, who is actually coming to the venue, having a communication directly with them, having a verified ticket, being able to trade that ticket, putting rules on that ticket. We currently do that now. If you want to, can you transfer it with a certain cap, all of those things that content could decide to do if they wanted to with the digital ticket. And the service fee, I read about being reduced. I mean the service fee could be reduced tomorrow. It's just a function of the venue, not the ticket company. So digital ticket and moving from the old TDF model that historically around the industry has been achieved to date, we've been talking the last couple of years about the progression of adoption. COVID obviously has really sped that up. Most tickets access now does not want to be in the contact business, so having a ticket on your mobile phone, walking into that venue and then being able to buy a drink, communicate with each other, upsell, you name the ideas when you have a direct communication with your fan, those are all being unlocked right now by sports teams, by venues and artists. So we think the blockchain technology is a great part of a technology solution to keep providing a better communication and identity platform for the fan. But that's already in place. There is nothing blockchain would bring to that that we can't or others currently achieved. So we'll continue to lose blockchain to supplement and augment our platform, and continue to look to be better at it. And we think it's a great opportunity in ticketing, just getting this full access. I would step back and Brandon, you and I've talked about this before in terms of what does the ticket company do? I mean, quite honestly, selling the ticket is the easiest part of being a ticketing company. When we talk to clients, they don't pick us because we can sell a ticket. They pick us because we have market -- marketing and distribution reach. They pick us because we have one of the largest marketplaces in the world to help them sell tickets. They pick us because we have a secured great technology platform they can plug-and-play with their APIs and their databases and their consumer needs. And they also pick us because it's a financing mechanism. A ticketing business is about financing the venues and exchanging that for ticketing rights. So it's a full bundle to be a ticketing company, and that's what Ticketmaster has delivered so successfully for so many years. And we'll continue to think lead with blockchain and bringing identity and all of the transparency and benefit but now having that ticket with an ownership to market. Brandon Ross : And can you maybe talk a little bit about -- hello? Michael Rapino : Yes. Brandon Ross : Can you maybe talk a little bit about the collectibles' angle to it? Michael Rapino : Right. Brandon Ross : Obviously, NFTs are very popular right now. How does that integrate into your ticketing system? Or is that something that would be separate from Ticketmaster? Michael Rapino : Right. No. That's -- and we think that's the great opportunity. NFTs are just another way of saying, can I add value to the customer relationship? Can I put a contract or privileges on that ticket for the customer? And that's a great mechanism and it's a great vehicle. I mean, whether we sell a T-shirt to that customer coming into a concert or we sell them a PDF with a unique piece of artwork or concert moment, it's another mechanism to engage your customer, find unique products that will let those magic memories of that event live on. So, macro level, we're always in the business of figuring out what else can we add to that experience that the customer would engage in to cement that magic moment called the concert. So NFTs specifically, on the Ticketmaster side, they're working already with sports teams and festivals and everyone else about how they would -- how they can layer an NFT on a ticket. You can mint a ticket and mint an NFT right on top of a Ticketmaster platform and deliver it how you want. So that's -- Ticketmaster will be in the delivery business using their ticket -- digital ticket, blockchain. And then as the customer creates its own NFT, we can sell those and bridge those together on whatever minting system and/or marketplace they use. On the Live Nation side, we're deep in exploration. We have a great team that's been working on this and working with the Mark Cubans of the world and others who are smart in this space. And I think you'll see us come out with an interesting Live Nation concert NFT angle. We think it's a great way for us to engage with our fans using that NFT and that direct relationship now to add rewards, add perks, add souvenir moments. We've all learned from top shops at the NBA, so we envision Live Nation with the marketplace and looking at some of its concert moments as magic moments that we could mint and attach to our ongoing ticket festivals and special moments. So we think it's -- if you have IP, we think it's an exciting time to use that IP to create some exciting moments with fans that can trade it ongoing and live that moment and kind of cement that relationship they have with that. July 16, the first concert back at Jones Beach, and I got an NFT and a special souvenir ticket that's mine forever. I can trade it. I can put it in my wallet and own that moment forever. So we think it's a fabulous moment to take a boring PDF and turn it into a magic souvenir with unlimited ideas on how you can bring that to life for the fan. So we think it's an exciting time. We think we'll be able to use our scalable IP to launch our own ways to engage with the fan in this space, as well as empowering our artists through our management company that we've been doing to date. Brandon Ross : Makes sense. And then, I guess while we're on ticketing, just one last one. With the Vivid back, thought maybe it would be a good time to get some updated -- your updated thoughts on the secondary ticketing market. Do you see that as a growth market, I guess, as an industry, first of all, and then for Ticketmaster, secondly? And kind of maybe how you see the competitive landscape in that arena now? Joe Berchtold : Yes. We absolutely believe in the secondary market. It's another set of distribution platforms of getting tickets in the hands of fans. For all the reasons Michael talked about in terms of digital ticketing and identity, we think that more and more of the control over secondary will go to content. The sports teams and the artists, as they have a wide set of agendas in terms of what they'd like to accomplish and how they'd like to have their relationship with their fans. So we think it -- we think there's some evolution as it goes to digital ticketing, and we absolutely support the content having more control over how that happens. We support there being more transparency in secondary. But we think it's here to stay, and it will continue to be an important distribution platform. We'll continue to focus on pricing to get as much of the value of those tickets in the hands of fans as we can. And I think as we look at Vivid, they've all got a similar business model, right, so all a service fee business model. They've got customer acquisition costs associated with a lot of search in digital, and we have more customer acquisition costs associated with alignment with content. But it's similar at the end of the day business model. We think we've got a great proposition by aligning with content and by also leveraging the scale of our Ticketmaster platform. So we like the position we're in, whether it grows or shrinks exactly as artists price their content to market value is less of a concern and making sure we're delivering on that content agenda. Brandon Ross : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ben Swinburne : Thank you. Michael, you kind of freaked me out with that July 2021 because I have a ticket to the Black Rose at Jones Beach on that day. So maybe you're going to be there as well, probably in better seats. I guess just picking up quickly on the secondary conversation with Brandon. Any comments or reaction to the noise out of DC on safe tickets and what's going on? I thought it was -- first I thought it was sort of unusual to be bringing up and defending sort of the secondary market in that context. But I didn't know -- you know, we sort of put the consent decree behind us, I thought. I don't know if you had any comment on that stuff since it came out over the last month or so? Michael Rapino : Yes. It would surprise us, too, that right now where we are. But (inaudible) has been on this mission for quite a while, so we would love to sit with his team and educate him on the business so we can get all of the idiosyncrasies nailed because it's never as simple as it seems. So I really -- we look at that as a bit of a nuance. They seem to be obviously, scalpers are doing a good job of convincing his staff that we are going to do a digital ticket in a closed platform. So that's their great fear that we're going to have a digital ticket, and we're going to tell you when you buy that ticket, you can only resell it at Ticketmaster. That's never been our intent. So their -- kind of their main claim (inaudible) if they would sit down with us, we'd explain it's never been our intent to have a closed platform. We've actually -- the biggest thing I've done at Ticketmaster since taken over is rebuild this Company so we can have an open platform. Our goal is to sell that first ticket. But as we did with the NFL last year, we have an open platform with the NFL. We power the NFL. And if those secondary companies are approved by the NFL, then that ticket you buy for the NFL can be freely sold on any other platform and used to get in the show. So that's -- we think it's the best model. We think we have the largest kind of footprint from a primary platform. We believe that if the ticket is to be resold, we have a great marketplace for that, for the Ticketmaster fan. But we're also working and have been working towards an open platform that it can be sold in other places if the content like the NFL or venues want that path forward. So not sure there's much meat to the claim. We're not looking to limit distribution. We're looking to increase distribution for the teams, venues and artists. And the best platforms will win in the end that offer the best value to the content and the fan. So that's our plan. We think we have an incredible opportunity in ticketing in that. The amount of people that buy at Ticketmaster and actually resell their ticket is very, very low, so we think we have a natural huge audience that we should do a better job of allowing you, the fan, if you just bought to think about how you can resell on our platform, and maybe there's better incentives we can do for you as a fan to make that even more seamless. But if you want to sell on other platforms as we do on the NFL, then we'll be happy to validate that ticket and let the content decide where it's sold. Ben Swinburne : That's very helpful. Second, just on Veeps, I think you guys announced 60 venues have been equipped with their technology. Just any updated thoughts on how substantial that opportunity is as you guys look into reopening later this year and into next year from a business point of view -- a business model point of view? Michael Rapino : Well, I think it's, you know, no different than we just talked about NFTs, right? Our job is to keep looking at our core business and making sure we can add more exciting products around that core business. We're just thrilled with the acquisition partnership with the Madden Brothers, who run this on a daily basis. It's their -- soul and sweat they put in, it's really all them. We've just added a bit of a firehose by helping them with our distribution. I think they're up to over 1,000 shows in the last year, probably grow somewhere over 10 million, so a good start to that business. But now you're going to see with our new clubs, we do 10,000 club shows. So you start digging into that a little bit, adding some amphitheaters, and the part we think is really exciting is our festivals. Opening up that model that in Lollapalooza instead of just rebroadcasting that for free. What if for $49, you could watch the Lollapalooza weekend, or you could buy the Lollapalooza day at home and continue your party at home if you couldn't make it to the venue. So we've seen great success in our EDM business. (inaudible) blown the numbers up on his business when he does that. So we think extending the festival, which is a bit of a party at home model, it's got a great opportunity. And I would much rather use my festivals to add another revenue ticket to the equation than treat it as promotion value. So we're going to test that this summer, and we think we'll get some learning, and that'll help us move forward in that place. If you just launch festival TV, you have a proposition itself there with our 150-plus festivals. So we think that's exciting plus our club business for young artists. So new space for us. We think it's an exciting place to add value. We think there is subscription ideas forward with that and we think we can bundle it with other things. We think there is a great foundation to our core business here that we can keep exploring and innovating on. Ben Swinburne : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Glagola : Hi. Thanks for the question. The July through November period for the festivals in the US and the UK appears pretty crowded. Outside the major festivals that you guys highlighted on the press release, is there -- is that having any -- is there any impact adversely on consumer demand in some of those other festivals given the crowded slate? And then also with the 2021 Rock in Rio rescheduled for 2022, does that mean you will have that festival two years in a row now '23 also? Michael Rapino : Well, I'll answer it backward. We'll -- we're debating the Rock in Rio decision, so we'll get to that -- Rock in Rio decision, we'll get to that later after we get '22 done. No, we don't have any fear of a crowded slate. I think as you saw maybe some of our releases, we just went up with Travis Scott yesterday or the day before and sold 100,000 tickets or Club (inaudible) went up because long -- it's biggest on sale ever. And Rolling Loud just was amazing. We sold 100,000 tickets in about an hour and had 200,000 people in the waiting line. So we're just seeing demand beyond any other historic moment. So Garth Brooks, this morning, I'm so proud, he broke every Ticketmaster record in history for the fastest stadium sale out. So I'm thrilled for the crowd, but I'm more thrilled that our ongoing investment in Ticketmaster and the amount of strain that causes to be the fastest-selling stadium in history or do 100,000 tickets in an hour is a testament to the Ticketmaster platform because the demand, the bots,  the load that hits you in that hour is amazing. So I'm proud that the Ticketmaster team is delivering, but also the demand right now is far exceeding any of our scheduling festivals right now. Stephen Glagola : Thanks, Michael. And one more, if I can. Just you spoke about the NFT impact and blockchain impact on your Ticketmaster operations. From the standpoint of artists potentially making more money, monetizing their back catalog or whatnot, does that make them become less reliant on touring as an earnings driver going forward in your view? Michael Rapino : Not sure if that was a statement or a question. But no, I would say that I think you've got to look at the macro pie always, right? There is always going to be a few artists that are able to sell their business at the top end. But if you look at the macro numbers, the percentage that comes from the road, the amount of artists that are dying to get back on the road, we're seeing right now a greater demand than ever from artists calling us saying, when could we get back out? And these are some very successful and wealthy artists. So we always look at that two hours on stage at a stadium is a drug that, that artist tends to want to run for his entire career. So we don't see any decline in that desire for that artist to get on stage. I think the reason you see Mick Jagger and The Stones on stage isn't financial at this point. I think it delivers something much bigger than a paycheck. So I think that magic moment on stage is non-duplicatable for the fan and something that artist doesn't get at home. Stephen Glagola : Yes. Looking forward to going back to shows in the second half. Thanks, Michael. Michael Rapino : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. David Katz : Hi. Good evening, and thanks for taking my questions. There's been an awful lot of discussion about the near-term demand. I wonder what data points or information or perspectives you might have about demand beyond, say, the next 12 or 18 months, and how you think about sort of the demand curve longer term? Michael Rapino : Yes. (Multiple Speakers) I guess if you're going to model that out, you'd probably -- you'd be thrilled that your first data point is the biggest demand in history. So I think however you model that out for the next, you know, I don't think you're going to see any cliff on that demand. I don't think these consumers are saying, I can't wait to get through '22, and then it's over. So I think this is showing. I mean, look, we always look at the -- I think the most important demand curve is the 17, 16 and 14 year-old of today excited about going to the show as the last kind of generation, right. We always get that question on who is the next Rolling Stones. And our data will continually show that, that young artist is capable of selling out stadiums and arenas very fast. I mean, Bad Bunny just went on sale and sold out arenas very fast, huge Latino star. So we're just seeing pockets of strengths coming from young artists every day. Billie Eilish is selling out instantly. So we see young artists regenerating the supply side. We see new 14-year olds going crazy for BTS all around the globe. That's a part to me is what I look at is, is it still as important to a 14 year old to see from the Beatles to go to NSYNC to Backstreet to Britney Spears to BTSs of today, right? So they seem to be -- my 10 year old is excited about concerts as I was when I was 10 or even more, I guess, so where he is based. But we see a great young vibrant supply demand in the business, to me, that's what you want to model in. And over time, it's still as important to a 15 year old of today and a 20 year old of today as it was 10 and 20 years ago. David Katz : Thank you. Sorry. Go ahead. Joe Berchtold : And David, just one other thing to add. I wouldn't just use what are the on sales of the past month as part of your indicator. This is a supply-constrained business with a lot of latent demand out there. And if you look at the past decade, and you look at how Live Nation went from 40 million fans a year to 100 million fans a year, it was by bringing more artists to more markets to more people, and unlock that latent demand because of the desire that Michael talked about. So there is a long track record that would say, concern about is the demand going to be there when you've got these great artists out on the road. David Katz : Agreed. And if I may follow up quickly. With respect to M&A, how are you thinking about sort of the timing and the boundaries and the catalysts for maybe getting out and putting some deals back on the board to grow that way? Joe Berchtold : Yes. We -- go ahead. Michael Rapino : Yes. No, I was just saying, I think we're -- we've been looking at our current pipe. We have a good pipe that was already in process when COVID started. We probably have 15 to 20 different venues around the world that are in some level of construction or development or opening, those are on plan, and we'll be opening up from theaters to amphitheaters. We've got an ongoing list of promoters and festivals around the world that we've been in conversations with. We've been closed a couple of those recently, and we'll keep doing that. So we will continue on our bolt-on strategy as we have been for many years to keep bolstering our global foundation and opportunity markets. Joe Berchtold : We're a growth business, and whether it's growth CapEx or M&A, we're going to be continuing to invest in the business. We're obviously, at a higher leverage level, but we are confident that as we continue to grow our AOI and that returns in 2022 and beyond, that we'll have plenty of flexibility to continue to drive that growth. David Katz : I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Jessye McVane : Hi. It's actually, Jessye McVane on for Ryan. Thanks for taking our question. Last call, you guys talked about ticket sales in the UK benefiting once guidelines and timelines for reopenings. But put in place, when we see states like New York announced this week that they will start to remove capacity restrictions later this month, or other states like Texas have already acted on. Are you seeing a similar step-change in demand here in the US? Or does it need to be done at a national level to have a similar effect? Joe Berchtold : We're absolutely seeing massive demand. I mean today is a great example, we added the first half dozen shows -- broadway shows have their presales wildly outperformed all expectations. So just whatever it was two or three days ago, they relaxed in New York on sales today, going great. Governors Ball, as Michael referred to, went on sale, far and away, the best first day for Governors Ball. So as every market is getting unlocked, that's telling the fans to be comfortable going out and buying the tickets, and it's consistent as we go market-to-market. Jessye McVane : Great. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As communities reopened, we're seeing the pent-up demand for live events play out as artists and fans are eager to reconnect in-person. In the U.S. and U.K., we're seeing strong ticket sales and the restart of our concerts and festivals highlighted over the past weekend by Lollapalooza and Rolling Loud in the U.S. and Latitude in the U.K. hosting three-quarters of a million fans combined. With the vaccine rollouts increasing throughout Canada and Europe, we expect additional markets to open up broadly in the coming months. And momentum for the return of live has been building every month, with ticket sales and concert attendance pacing faster than expected, underscoring the strength and resilience, the Concert business, live events in general. This progress combined with our cost discipline has enabled us to deliver positive AOI for the second quarter, well ahead of where we thought we would be for this quarter. We expect to see for the ramp up accelerate to the rest of the year with all segments returning to AOI profitability for the second half of the year, then it's up for a full-scale 2022. As we put more shows on sale for this year and next, ticket sales are the best early indicator for concerts and our overall business. To that end, June was Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month in history for transacted ticket volume. This was driven in part by our U.S. Concert division, putting the highest number of shows on sale ever during a single month, 50% more than the next highest mark back in 2019. In Concerts, our or recovery this summer continue to be led by our outdoor events at our festivals and amphitheaters. We expect to have over 6 million fans attend our festivals during the second half of the year, with about two-thirds of our festivals increasing their attendance compared to 2019. Most of our major festivals sold out in record time, while average ticket prices have been 10% higher than 2019. And while still early at our amphitheater shows over the past few weeks, we have delivered strong double-digit increase in average per fan revenue and onsite spending versus 2019. Looking forward to 2022 and that 2023, all our leading indicators continue to point to a roaring era for concerts and other live events. Starting with our Concerts division, every major venue type arenas, amphitheaters, and stadiums, our pipeline indicating double-digit growth in our show count and ticket sales relative to 2019 levels. In some cases, our pipeline is so strong, we are extending our planning into 2023 and even beginning to discuss tours that extended to 2024.  The same time, Ticketmaster's leading edge technology continues to attract new clients, adding 11 million net new feed bearing tickets so far this year, already surpassing any previous full year growth. As a result, Ticketmaster is set to benefit in 2022 from both increased Live Nation concert ticket sales, as well as additional sales from new clients. In our Sponsorship business, our brand partners have maintained and grown their interest in live events, with contracts and sponsorship up double-digits for 2022, where we were at this point in 2019 for 2020. As our revenue is rebounding, we continue to evolve our business to maximize opportunities and the global recovery and strengthen our flywheel. We have structurally reduced our cost basis by $200 million, making us more nimble and converting more of our revenue AOI. We have integrated our Ticketmaster team globally, enabling us to work toward a global product roadmap that will both reduce our costs and increase our flexibility and speed to deploy new client tools and approve our marketplace experience. And we continue to build our direct to consumer business initiatives ranging from streaming concerts NFTs to artists merchandise, bringing more value to artists and deepening fan relationships. These enhancements combined with our strongest supply and demand dynamics our industry has ever seen are fueling our core flywheel strategy and setting us up for multiple years of growth, attendance revenue, and AOI. And with that, I'll let Joe take you through more details of our results. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've done over the past year, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. In the second quarter, our AOI was positive for the first time since the start of the pandemic, as the U.S. by far our largest market, accelerated its reopening also driving our revenue to the highest level since the first quarter of last year. As a result, our contribution margin ramped up faster than expected, particularly in ticketing. Even with the increased activity, our monthly gross burn for the first half of the year was lower than the monthly burn during the last three quarters of 2020 due to our structural cost savings and continued cost discipline. As a result, we remain confident that actions taken to reduce cash burn and increased liquidity will provide us with the runway we need as shows return. And as we move toward reopening in more markets, we continue to balance the strong cost and cash management with making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect to generate positive AOI overall, and for each segment for the second half of the year, we will also reduce costs this year by over $800 million and reduce cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre-pandemic plans. Looking at our Q2 results. Revenue for the quarter was $576 million compared to $74 million in the second quarter of 2020 for growth of over $0.5 billion. All three of our business segments more than doubled their revenues from last year. Our AOI for the quarter was $10 million compared to a loss of $432 million for the second quarter of 2020. Our Q2, 2021 AOI consisted of $351 million of contribution margin, which included $364 million from operations, along with various one-time items, including gains from insurance recoveries and government support and losses from ticketing service fee refunds paid out. This was then offset by $341 million in operational fixed costs. Getting into our business segments a bit deeper, starting with ticketing, which was the primary driver of our results this quarter, contribution margin for the quarter was $204 million or nearly 60% of our total contribution margin delivering $99 million in AOI. Ticketing revenue for the quarter was $244 million or just over 40% of our total revenue for the quarter. Each month of a quarter, Ticketmaster had progressively stronger results, culminating with June being Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month ever for transacted ticket volume. In general, North America drove much of this resurgence, accounting for over 75% of total transacted tickets in the quarter as compared to approximately two-thirds of transacted tickets for 2019. Contract tickets drove much of this activity, and as a result, the top 10 artists sold over $513 million in GTV during second quarter this year compared to $329 million in the second quarter of 2019. Secondary ticketing has similarly rebounded. Our June GTV was only 8% below June of 2019. That trend has continued into the third quarter, with July 12th marking the highest resale GTV day in our history, driven by the U.S. Open along with strong NBA, NFL, and concert presale volumes. These results in ticketing are a leading indicator to our concerts business. For the second quarter, our concerts AOI loss of $84 million was an improvement of $127 million relative to Q2 last year, and our revenue was up $145 million relative to Q2 last year, as we promoted nearly 1,700 shows for 1.3 million fans during the quarter. More importantly, these tickets sales drove our event-related deferred revenue up to $2.1 billion, representing a pipeline of future activity, even higher than the $1.6 billion we had at the end of the second quarter in 2019. In part, this event-related deferred revenue is associated with over 25 million tickets we have sold for our concerts in the second half of this year, along with also being part of the 14 million tickets that we have already sold for concerts in 2022, which reflects strong double-digit growth in our 2022 pipeline for show count and fans relative to 2019. Sponsorship and advertising then naturally flow from our ticketing and concert platforms. Our sponsorship and advertising AOI for the quarter was $13 million and revenue was $45 million, with the bulk of our activity tied to our ticketing platform and concert presales. We continue to find brands are committed to maintaining or increasing their span with Live Nation to reach our music fans and other live event audiences. And during the quarter we added several long-term strategic partners, including Allegiant Air, Adobe and Cinch in the airline technology and auto sectors, respectively. And more broadly, we expect our sponsorship and advertising full-scale activity to return somewhere between ticketing and concerts timing. Most importantly, as we look out at our 2022 pipeline, confirmed activity is pacing well ahead of where we were in 2019 at this point. And with many multiyear contracts on the books, we are lining up to be growing this business in 2022 and beyond. Looking at free cash and liquidity. As of June 30th, we had total cash of $4 billion, including $1.1 billion in ticketing client cash and $1.8 billion in net concert event related cash, leaving free cash of $1.1 billion. This was flat relative to our first quarter reported number. Our free cash, along with $971 million of available debt capacity, gives us $2.1 billion in readily available liquidity up from $1.6 billion at the end of 2020, and steady with our Q1 ending liquidity. Benefiting our free cash position, the second quarter was $161 million in favorable timing, largely the result of classification of our event-related deferred revenue between short-term and long-term. Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $163 million or $54 million per month, which included $115 million per month of operational burn up from $100 million per month in the first quarter, as furloughed employees returned to prepare for our reopening and we reinstated full pay for most employees, plus another $58 million per month of non-operational costs, including investment in capital expenditures, acquisitions and artists and ticket client advances to give us $173 million average per month in gross burn. In Q2, we had $119 million average per month cash contribution margin, double our Q1 average. Turning to other balance sheet items, more on deferred revenue. At the end of the second quarter, event-related deferred revenue for shows that we'll play in the next 12 months was $2.1 billion, up from $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. Ticket sales in the second quarter were nearly $900 million, while refunds totaled $100 million and shifted deferred revenue from short-term to long-term for shows that were rescheduled into the back half of 2022, totaled $150 million. This long-term deferred revenue will then largely shift back to short-term during Q3 and Q4 reversing the timing benefit and free cash this quarter. Our total capital expenditures were $52 million for the first six months, with $38 million spent on revenue generating items. The markets have reopened faster than expected. We will similarly be accelerating some of our investments to take advantage of additional opportunities this year and into 2020. As a result, we now expect total capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $170 million, with over 60% of this spend going into revenue generating CapEx projects. Our total debt as of June 30th was $5.3 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.4%, with about 90% of that debt at a fixed rate. Finally, looking forward, as Michael said, we continue to expect concerts to scale further in the second half of this year in key markets, notably outdoor, and led by the U.S. and U.K. With this activity, we will continue to ramp up our operations, enabling Ticketmaster to run its on sale, the concerts division to book end market 2022 tours and sponsorship staff to support delivery for brands onsite and online. Given the COVID issues in our key markets appear to be short-term at this point, we continue to expect 2022 activity and results to exceed 2019 levels with continued growth opportunities from there. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Your first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. David Karnovsky : Hi. Thank you. Just with COVID kind of being what it is at the moment, the Delta variant, can you just maybe talk through how you're thinking about navigating some of the challenges that might come up in the next a month or two, like changing health mandates, shifts in demand, any hesitation or concerns on the part of the artist? Joe Berchtold : Sure. David, this is Joe. I think what we're seeing is a shift to increasing requirements for entry of either vaccinated or tested or fully vaccinated. We had Lollapalooza over the last weekend, very successfully done, over 90% of the people were fully vaccinated, which I think was a great signal in terms of people's commitment and support of being vaccinated in order to go to these shows. So, my expectation is that we will see that continue, whether at the artist's level, at the city level, like New York just announced or large crowds, frankly Lollapalooza certainly went above and beyond what was happening at baseball games in Chicago. And similarly, I think, in other markets we're going above what others are doing. So, we'll continue to focus on that. I think the great news is that at this point, the discussion is around what are the requirements to hold the events? What do we need to see in terms of vaccinations and testing? Not hearing discussions, certainly in the U.S. or the U.K. about impacting those shows to any scale. David Karnovsky : Got it. And I know you just restarted the amp and the festivals, but any early insights in the fan behavior so far. You mentioned per caps are up at the amp, is there any additional color you can provide what's driving that. And then, maybe with digital ticketing, any learnings from having that tech kind of rolled out at scale across your own music venue footprint? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Yeah. At this point, we've probably done about 50 amp shows that we've gotten the data on in time for today's call. And as we said, all of that looks to be continuing to trend up. People are buying more food and beverage. We're selling more VIP packages, more upsells. So, in general, the pocket books are open. I think it's pretty mature to get any real specific inferences. And I think it's also just -- it's a little bit early to get the specific impact of digital ticketing. We believe that eliminating friction always helps commerce, but we probably won't have the data on that till our next call. David Karnovsky : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Laszczyk : Hey, great. Thank you. On the 2022 concert pipeline being up double-digits versus 2019, I was wondering if you could give us a sentence on how much of the pipeline is for sale today or sold today versus how much is still to come. And then, as you maybe look out over the next few quarters, how much headroom do you think is left to grow the concert slate in 2022, given some of the scheduling and health constraints you're working with, any commentary, there would be helpful. Joe Berchtold : Sure. We are -- go ahead. Michael Rapino : So, I'll start Joe, and then you jump. Most of our 2022 new tours wouldn't be on sale yet. Most of -- what you see on sale is what would have been rescheduled from 2021 are already on sale. So, we have a large on-sell slate plan between now and end of the year for most of the big global tours that will go out in 2022. And we're not -- we're very content with our 2022 lineup right now. We're talking mostly about what to add now into 2023 and 2024. So that idea that -- it's just one year of -- our bigness isn't really true. We've got three, four years here of strong demand that we're going to smooth out over the time, so everyone can get the right markets and the right Friday nights and the right dates. So, we see a good few year run with all this pent-up inventory. Stephen Laszczyk : Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, on the Ticketmaster side, and you mentioned you had an 11 million net new fee bearing tickets year-to-date. I think I was up from around 5 million last quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about who you're winning this ticket business from. Is this a certain types of venues, league teams, maybe some of the things that's resonating with your pitch with these potential ticketing partners. Thank you. Joe Berchtold : Yeah. It's really happening on a global basis. We're seeing it in the U.S. We're seeing in Europe. We're seeing it in Asia. We put out various releases in terms of -- as we've been picking up some clients, but I wouldn't say that there's one market or one type of client in particular. It's pretty broad. I do think what's resonating is we've been very loud in terms of artist clearing the extent to which we're continuing to invest in ticketing, in the shift to digital ticketing and the benefit that that's going to be giving to the teams, the venues and the customers. And that seems to be working with the clients we're talking to. Stephen Laszczyk : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. John Janedis : Thanks. I just had two questions. One was, with the expectations for the touring supercycle over the next, call it, two to three years. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the demand side in terms of fans and do you assume sale ups for the cycle are at pre-pandemic levels or maybe higher or lower? And then, on the ticketing margin side, there was -- a lift there. Is that a chunk of the $200 million in cost savings is kicking in and there's something close to that level of new normal, or are there any items to call out? Michael Rapino : I'll do demand side. I think we -- from the data we're seeing so far, everything we seem to be putting on sale is doing better than pre-pandemic. So, demand seems to be pent-up most of what we see going up for 2022 is great quality, tourists and artists. So, we would expect, as we've seen over the last 10 years, demand, overall for live on a global basis, has continually been growing. We like to always point out, we think that the product is still under priced, given all of the secondary business. So, this is still an attractive night out for a fan. And now that artists traveling more around the world, the fan base has grown for live as a functional -- entertainment item. So, we think global demand will continue, have double-digit growth as an industry for many years to come as the global landscape continues to grow. Joe Berchtold : And then, John, on the TM margin, I mean, clearly, I spoke in my comments that we're looking this year, that we're going to be reducing our total cost structure by about $800 million relative to where we were pre-pandemic. And the $200 million structural savings is a subset of that. So, what we're navigating this year is the pace at which we bring back some of the costs versus the pace at which we ramp up activity. And it's not going to be totally linear. We had a great month of June in TM, and we're finally getting back to scale there and we expect to have nice scale with Ticketmaster in the second half, but the first part of the year was lower scale. So, overall, yeah, we expect margins to improve, because a large chunk of that $200 million is going to come out of Ticketmaster and that would just naturally flow into a margin. I wouldn't try to overly analyze the single quarter and let's get you a few more quarters at more traditional scale, with more traditional costs and staffing over the next six months. John Janedis : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Ross : Thanks. A couple of questions ago, the conversation centered around ticketing wins and press releases for you guys. And I thought one of the more interesting developments in the quarter was the extension and expansion of your relationship with ASM. For two reasons, one is that ASM's, obviously half AEG and it didn't go to access. But more so that Ticketmaster could sell tickets for Live Nation promoted shows in the other ASM venues. And the North American ticket model's been exclusive for -- as long as I can remember, at least. Is this a sign of change in the future? Do you think that exclusivity model is here to stay, or do you think depending on event type, the promoter will ultimately control the ticket? Joe Berchtold : Yeah. I think the exclusive approach has worked well for the venues and the ecosystem is a large part of how the venues get funded and how the venues then make the rental costs approachable for promoters and artists. So, it's an ecosystem that's worked well in the U.S. and the Ticketmaster, as you know, has been a very large source of funding and the profit stream for the venues. I wouldn't read too much into this. If you look at ASM scale, that's not a common, typical scale in terms of the number of buildings they have. It's also a fairly unique situation where you have somebody who owns buildings. Who's saying, we're going to let you bring in Ticketmaster regardless of the situation. And they control both sides of that decision-making. It's not something that we are looking to do or that we see as any real mark of the industry going forward. Michael Rapino : What I would add, Brandon, I think the most -- Brandon, I wouldn't say the most important thing you said is what you lead with is the fact that ASM owned by AEG and a private equity fund, the largest venue management company, obviously did their homework and debated their own ticket options and renewed with Ticketmaster, because we ultimately provide the best global solution in ticketing for them. I assume they would have liked to have used their own in-house ticketing system. But I think our relationship and what we've done for all those venues for so long, won us that business, the met renewal. So that was a very important renewal, a very good testament to Ticketmaster. I give the ASM management team credit, they put their bias aside and what was the best option in the marketplace after looking at all options. So, we are very proud that that's a very good testament to the Ticketmaster core competency. You hit that part for sure. Brandon Ross : Cool. Thanks. Michael Rapino : And you can update your Twitter now that we've talked about COVID and Delta. We assumed it would -- what happened on this call. Brandon Ross : Great. Operator : Your next question comes from \u2026 Joe Berchtold : Sorry. We missed that. Is there a question? Operator? Operator? Operator : I apologize. Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ben Swinburne : Hi. Can you hear me? Joe Berchtold : Yeah. Ben, big build up. Ben Swinburne : Yeah. Better not follow it. A couple of questions. So, you ended your prepared remarks, I think by saying you continue to expect 2022 activity levels to exceed 2019. And I apologize if that's a reiteration of prior guidance that I might've missed. But just wanted to ask you what you meant by that. Is that a comment about revenue and AOI? I know where -- the street expectations are, but I thought I'd give you a chance to maybe expand on that. And then, the second question is just, you made a helpful comment around sponsorship saying that I think contracted business is up double-digits for 2022 relative to where you were in 2019 for 2020. I guess similar question, the ticketing question, how much of the forward year is sort of already in the books typically to understand what that tells us about next year and make sure we don't over extrapolate that comment about growth for a sponsorship. Thank you. Joe Berchtold : Yeah. Just in terms of overall 2022 expectations. First, it starts for us with what are the concert bookings. What are the show count look like? And from that, our expectations on the ticket counts, both of which we think, again, are up relative to 2019 based on what we said. And I think as we've gone through the past three months, whatever we said three months ago, we're more confident in that at this point. And as a result, we expect then revenue and AOI growth relative to 2019 as well to be and sponsorship, then we'll be a part of that expectation, up double-digits and committed sponsorship. Usually you'd have -- I mean, we've talked about how much of our sponsorship is in the form of multiyear, multi-million dollar, multi-asset strategic sponsors. That's a large portion of our sponsorship base. So, last -- we probably wouldn't be talking about expectations of growth for next year already at this point, unless we had a pretty good feel that a lot of it was committed. Ben Swinburne : Sure. Makes sense. Great. Thank you very much. Joe Berchtold : Operator? Operator, do we have any other questions? David Katz, if you're on the line, can you go ahead and ask your question? I think you're next to the queue. Can you hear us? Operator : Yes. I apologize. Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. David Katz : Okay. If you can all hear me okay. Joe Berchtold : Yep. No problem. David Katz : Appreciate you taking my question. Appreciate all the detail. What I wanted to ask about since it is prevalent in a lot of other areas of our coverage is, the issue of human resources and labor, where we have seen a lot of constraints around, frankly getting people to come back to work. You made a comment about it in your prepared remarks, bringing people back at full salaries and so forth. Is that a matter that you have had to deal with work around, strategize around and how do you see it? Joe Berchtold : Yeah. Start with, as you know, unfortunately we had to furlough a reasonable number of people over the course of the last year. At this point, we've brought back over 90% of our furloughed staff, of those we've called back over 90% have returned furlough. We had a fairly low turnover rate and we think turnover rate at, or below the overall entertainment industry. So, we feel very good about how we've been able to retain staff. I think it's a testimony to people's commitment to our industry and the culture that we've built here. So, in terms of the core people that are the ones that we've talked about, bringing back the shows, bringing back the ticketing and the sponsorship, those people are in place. As we've put on our shows in various amphitheaters and festivals sites around the country and around the world, we've been able to get the volume of people we needed. It hasn't been a material cost impact, taking in total. And we've had to work a bit harder at times to find the people, but it has not impacted our ability to put on the shows. David Katz : Perfect. Thank you very much. Michael Rapino : And I would add to that. I think the only piece that we're working through right now is the -- all the part-time employees that are on the front of the line at the amphitheater, at the festival, we're going to be rolling out soon our kind of mandated vaccine for our employees. We're going to move forward and be very progressive on ensuring all our employees are vaccinated. And we're going to move lower with artists and managers, where we're seeing there -- the likes of these artists that are going to want fully vaccinated and tested shows as ways to continue to keep the show moving forward. So, I think that the biggest challenge we've had is just scrambling on a day-to-day basis with part-time employees back, and abiding by different local COVID laws, mask, no mask, now test no test. I think that's been our only real challenge from an HR and communication. So, hats off to my frontline. They're doing an incredible job, running, hard, trying to adjust, and we're going to move to more central protocols now on mandating the backseat and helping them out, make sure they're all safe, too. David Katz : Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve \u2026 Joe Berchtold : We are back here, operator. We missed the name. Michael Rapino : Well, we can put a concert on, but on a conference call. Operator : Steve Glagola, your line is now live. Michael Rapino : Steve? Joe Berchtold : Hey, Steve. Go ahead. Stephen Glagola : Hi, guys. Thank you. Well, you still have the best earnings call music. So, if that means anything. I'd say -- I just had a question on, can you discuss how much the ticketing GTV was tied to sports versus concerts in the quarter, and how you see that mix over the second half of the year? Joe Berchtold : Yeah. Those were certainly the two largest components, concerts and sports. And we'll again in the second half as we relaunch -- second half relaunch, NBA, NHL, NFL, all of those at scale. So you'll have a big full season of the three major sports. And at the same time, you're going to have a massive on sale for 2022. I wouldn't try to parse exactly which one's bigger than the other in a given month, but those two will be the two key drivers as they were in the past few months. Stephen Glagola : Okay. Thanks, Joe. And I don't know if you've already said this, so I apologize. But on the guidance for AOI profitability across every segment in the second half, is that for each quarter or is that just the sum of Q3 and Q4? Joe Berchtold : We just -- our comment was for the sum of Q3 and Q4 that each segment, we expect to be AOI positive. Stephen Glagola : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to close the call out. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us. Live music roared back over the past quarter, driving all our business stipends to positive AOI for the first time in two years with companywide AOI of $306 million. The 2021 summer concert season rebounded quickly, with 17 million fans attending our shows in the quarter has returned to live, reflected tremendous pent-up demand. Festivals were large part of our return to live this summer with many of our festivals selling out in record time, and then overall ticket sales for major festivals was up 10% versus 2019.  Then we had a number of our tours are already sell over 500, 000 tickets for tours this year, including sellout tours by Harry Styles, Chris Stapleton, and others. In addition to increasing attendance, strong demand also enabled improving pricing with average amphitheater and major festival pricing up double-digits relative to 2019, and at our shows, fans spend at record levels with onsite spending per fan up over 20% in both amphitheaters and festivals compared to 2019.  We delivered these results with an operating environment that required us to wrap up quickly it's new health and safety protocols, and staff our frontline in a tight labor market. On the health and safety front, we set the industry standard by requiring proof of vaccine or testing for our shows, with no change in fan purchase behavior. More importantly, our protocols proved effective at mitigating major COVID disruptions to our business in the U.S. and UK, and allowed us to work in conjunction with local health officials to mitigate transmission risks from our events. On the labor front, we were able to set staffing requirements for our peak outdoor season without any show disruptions.  We also saw strong fan demand in our Ticketmaster results. We delivered its highest AOI quarter ever. Q3 was Ticketmaster's fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, led by sports legs restarting and concert on-sales for 2022 ramping up. In addition, Ticketmaster's secondary business delivered its highest GTV month in September, showing continued growth in the segment, even as artists and content owners continue shifting more of the value to primary sales. And as the fans came back, so did our brand partners who continue to seek to connect to the live music fan.  As a result, our sponsorship and advertising business delivered over $100 million in AOI for the quarter, the first time at this level since Q3 of 2019. Return of sponsorship and advertising has been largely driven by historic major partners, along with the addition of new brands, including Truly Hard Seltzer, as well as Coinbase and Solana in the Fintech segment. As we look forward to 2022, we are encouraged by all our leading indicators across each business. Through October our confirmed show count across amphitheaters, arenas, stadium shows are up double-digits, relative to the point in 2019 to 2020 shows. And through mid-October, we have already sold 22 million tickets for our shows in 2022 and demand has been stronger than ever for many of these on sales, with a million tickets sold for each of the Coldplay and Red-Hot Chili Peppers tours, and several other tours already selling over 500,000 tickets. Ticketmaster is on sale for 2022 also reinforcing this demand, as we expect  transacted fee-bearing GTV to be at record level, even after already selling 65 million fee-bearing tickets for events next year. Ticketmaster also added clients represented in over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets so far this year, further accelerating its growth on a global basis.  And our Sponsorship and Advertising business had similar success, with confirmed pipeline for 2022 up double-digits relative to this time in 2019 to 2020. At the same time, we are continuing our cost focused deliver $200 million in structural savings from our pre -pandemic 2020 plan, making us nimbler and better positioned to invest for future growth. As we get close to turning the page in 2021, I remain more convinced than ever in the power and potential of live entertainment, and the strength of our position.  No industry was more impacted by the pandemic over the last two years, and no industry has so proven the durability of its demand in the face of such disruption. I fully expect we will continue to have bumps in the road in the coming months. And it will take some time for international artists maturing on a truly global basis. But the fundamental strength of live entertainment and Live Nation has proven out and expect we will only continue to grow from here. With that, I will let Joe take you through more details on our results. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the detail on each business, a few points of context for the quarter, first, this is primarily a U.S. and UK driven quarter. These markets accounted for 95% of our fans in Q3 versus 75% in Q3 of 2019. And they represented 90% of fee-bearing GTV in Q3 versus 80% in Q3 of 2019. Second, our concerts activity primarily ramped up in August with 90% of our attendance for shows occurring in August and September.  Let me now go into more detail on the divisions. First concerts, as Michael noted, pricing and onsite spending was up for both our amphitheaters and our major festivals in the U.S. and UK. With almost 1200 amphitheater shows played off, these shows give us the best data set for comparing to 2019. So, give you more detail on trends for these shows, and in general, the same trends also hold for our festivals.  On pricing, average ticket pricing at our amphitheaters was up 17% to $63. There are 2 primary drivers to this. First, ticket pricing, including more platinum and VIP tickets for shows this year, increased average ticket pricing by $7. Secondly, our concert week promotion and other promotions were smaller-scale this year, which had an impact of $2 per ticket. Then for onsite spending, average fan spending was up 25% to $36. This growth came from a combination of more orders per fan, more items per order, and higher average spend per order. Many of our fans shifted to buying higher-priced products, which was part of our higher spend per order. And the shift to cashless also helped as card transactions have historically been larger than cash transactions, and this has held up as we shifted to 100% cashless. Finally, operating costs, including labor costs were up. These higher labor costs are driven by several factors, fewer shows per building, our accelerated ramp up to open the buildings this summer, new health and safety protocols and a generally tightened labor market.  At the same time as noted with increased average ticket price and higher onsite spending, we increased the contribution margin per fan and did so to such a level that our profitability per fan, net of operating expenses rose double digits. Turning now to Ticketmaster, as Michael said, Ticketmaster had a record AOI of a $172 million for the quarter, driven by its fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, and lower cost structure from its reorganization. Along with lower ramp-up labor costs as we accelerated activity faster than the return of staff. Primary ticketing was driven substantially by concerts, which accounted for over 70% of fee-bearing GTV, while sports was the second largest category, and together they represented approximately 90% of all fee-bearing GTV. Geographically, North America accounted for 80% of fee-bearing GTV as activity remained limited internationally outside the UK. In secondary ticketing, we similarly saw concerts and sports account for over 90% of fee-bearing GTV, though in this case, sports were the primary driver with the launch of new football and basketball seasons.  Another contributor to our growth in ticketing is the continued signing of new clients with over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets added this year through the third quarter. These new client additions have been particularly strong internationally, accounting for 2/3 of our new client tickets. Finally, sponsorship AOI surpassed a $100 million in the quarter for the first time in 2 years as it again had available ad units at scale, both on-site and online. Like our other businesses, it was largely U.S. and UK driven together accounting for approximately 90% of total activity. And as activity resumed, we were also able to engage new sponsors, adding 8 new strategic sponsors in the quarter.  As we look to Q4, we see a continuation of the same trends we had in Q3. With concerts, we expect North America and the UK to continue ramping toward historical activity levels. While the rest of Europe and other international markets have limited activity given the lead time to plan concerts. With ticketing we expect a broader recovery as most European markets put stadium and arena tours on sale in Q4, enabling GTV levels that could approach Q4 2019 levels, despite 65 million fee-bearing tickets already being sold for 2022 events.  And while Q4 is typically a seasonally slower period for sponsorship, it too should benefit from concerts and ticketing sales ramping up. Let us now turn to our cash and cost management. We have free cash at $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter, which includes $450 million earmarked for the OCESA acquisition. This was our first quarter since 2019 where our cash contribution margin was higher than our cash burn, contributing a net $166 million in free cash. We also added $850 million in cash in the quarter through our $400 million drawdown of our Term A loan and $450 million equity raise for ASESA, mentioned previously.  We then had free cash reduced by $370 million, largely resulting from long-term deferred revenue shifting into short-term for show's next summer as we previously indicated would be happening. This improved cash position was also helped by our ongoing cost and cash management program as this year, we expect to reduce costs by $900 million and cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre -pandemic plans and on the cash, side excluding ASESA. As we prepare for 2022 plans, we remain confident that we have structurally reduced our operating costs by $200 million relative to our pre -pandemic 2020 plans.  A few other balance sheet items. Our deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. This is compared to $950 million at the end of Q3 of 2019, which gives us the best like for like view of the demand pipeline already in place. And then a reminder on our debt, that we continue with our liquidity covenants until we report Q4 this year, at which point we switch to a more traditional leverage test. Given our current liquidity and expected Q4 and 2022 activity levels, we do not anticipate any covenant issues through next year, and expect to continue investing in growth. With that, let me open the call for questions, Operator. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with J.P Morgan. Please proceed with your question. David Karnovsky : Thank you. AC rob returned to target scale. What have you found about operating with a reduced cost structure, and how do you think about expense growth from here relative to pre -pandemic where I think you've noted you were just less focus as an organization on driving cost efficiencies? And then just a second question, how are you thinking about labor constraints as you ramp toward this huge wave supply coming in 2022, are there any concerns about finding out road as new crews and then to the extent costs you move up, who bears that  promoter or is that kind of goes to the artist. Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Sure. Just on operating with a reduced cost structure, we had the benefit if you will, of really 0 base in our cost structure over the past year and a half, so -- and we've talked through at various points, a lot of it around Ticketmaster's globalization and how we revised our approach on the concert side. So, we're not seeing any issues in terms of operating with this renewed cost structure because it's been a pretty methodical laid out approach to how we want to run the business.  And then I think as we move forward and we continue to grow the business, our expectations are that the incremental profitability of our business is as good or better than it's ever been, and that there continues to be a long runway to do so. In terms of the labor constraint as we talked, we were able to put on all of our shows this year without any issues. Looking forward to next year at the end of probably -- we don't think that there's any issue in terms of getting back to the level of activity that we've had, or the level of activity that we're talking about, in terms of our pipeline of shows.  Ultimately, that is what the short-term constraining is in terms of why we won't be doing 45 mega tours, where you can't have 80% growth in a given year. It does have to do with some of the short-term ability to get your buses or to get your staff, but there's no long-term constraints for the growth. And we're still able to grow it in next year. In terms of the costs incurred, it's different pieces for different folks that the artist is generally responsible for their crew and their operations that they're being out on the road and we're responsible for the venues that we operate. Michael Rapino : Just to add a little -- just to add texture to that, we would have absolutely in July or August with the idea that we had to instantly hire 20,000 people for summer amphitheaters usually would happen way back in April, we would've had concern but we surprisingly we're able to fully staff all of those jobs, as Joe said. Marginal cost increased a few million dollars.  So, we did see that the part-time seasonal workforce that needed to come back to help make the machine work were eager to get back. So, we didn't have that challenge. I think we're going to keep looking at how we do a better job of attracting and retaining them in today's environment, but we don't see that as a cost challenge, we think it's an exciting category so a lot of people like coming to work at the amphitheater, the club, the theatre, the lifestyle type job, and then as Joe said, we had no supply chain issues. The artist gets on stage, there's plenty of trucks, lights, staging, etc. to make the machine work on a global basis. David Karnovsky : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Q - Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Ross : Hello. Thanks for taking the questions. Just -- you talked about your quarter and how the return to lives has been predominantly in the U.S. and UK. Wondering if you could give an update on when I know it's a big world out there, but when we can expect the rest of the world to get back to those 2019 levels and beyond that we've seen in the US and the UK. And then I have a follow-up. Michael Rapino : Yeah, I'll jump in and Joe can jump. We've -- we had a global call yesterday this week with all of our different presidents. We're feeling very confident, obviously Canada, U.S., UK are fully open. Europe will be fully open by the end of the year. So, we'll have most of the main markets open into January. Pacific Rim, Latin America, all looks positive in terms of being open fully for international artists by April.  We think internationally, on a global basis by April the world will be moving around again. It doesn't overly affect our business short-term because most of the outdoor stadium festival business is summer time, so that will be all fully up and rolling. We have Lollapalooza starting in April in Latin America and Australia festivals. So, we think we'll be open for prime season, and we'll be rolling around indoors in the main markets of U.S., Europe, Canada, and the UK between now and April. Brandon Ross : Right, and I wanted to focus a little on your O&O business. You talked about that prime season starting into April, and you extended your AMP season and festival season this year as the summer got off to a late start, do you plan on keeping that summer season extended going forward? Is that a way for you to own more of the fans? Joe Berchtold : Yeah. It's a great point, right. You just forced yourself in this last 2 years to think differently and extract more value from your base, and we absolutely look at it now and see specially in most of Southern America we can stay open much longer than we historically have. So yes, we will look to extend the seasons in those markets for sure. Brandon Ross : Great. And then Michael, I saw on your social that you invested in some new international venues. Can you maybe explain to us what your new venue strategy is going forward, what you're trying to accomplish in other parts of the world? Michael Rapino : I always think we underestimate bragging about our venue portfolio. We are ready well over 200 venues that we operate somewhere in the world, amphitheaters, theaters, clubs, arenas in Dublin, Holland, etc. So, we know that the venue when we go vertical is a high-margin business for us. And I consider festivals almost venues, because you get to own the real estate for the weekend, you're owning all the revenue streams. So anytime that we can put a show in our festival or our venue on ticketed by Ticketmaster's, have our sponsorship able to use the asset and count all the revenue streams, it's our highest margin business.  What we've seen over time now is, in the last 5 years, is there has been a new real estate boom around the world where every major city in the world looks at live entertainment much like they used to look at movie theatres as being this incredible tenant in their development. So, we are talking ongoing to multiple developers around the world who are building something and they wanted 2,000-seat, a 5,000-seat, a 7,000-seat, maybe an arena than anchor into one of their developments. So, we've really ramped up that division over the last 2 years and we see great opportunity around the world of continuing to expand our venue portfolio in these prime markets. I mean, Austin's an example where there's no arena. We're going to open that arena in the next couple of years. It's going to be a monster of a return for us as a great single venue in the Austin market right now, for live shows to complement our club, our theater, our amphitheater portfolio. So, we'll continue to be very opportunistic in the markets around the world where there's an opening for a live venue of any size. Brandon Ross : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Laszczyk : Great, thank you. I appreciate all the detail you provided on the pricing and spending trends in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about how durable you think those trends will be into next year, especially now that you have the vantage point of seeing these trends play out across an entire summer conversely. And then, now that we're getting closer to 2022, and the slate's taking more shape, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the cadence of shows that you expect in 2022 and how that might compare to a normal year? Thank you. Joe Berchtold : Sure. This is Joe. I'll start on the pricing and the per-caps. I think we believe this is structurally a level of spend that we're seeing from the consumer now on the pricing, heavily driven by the front of the house, the best seats where we've long known there's this arbitrage because of the size and continued growth of the secondary market  even as we've been pricing and moving more money to the artists over the past several years. So, this year that trend continued. More VIP, more platinum tickets, getting that money to the artist. And we're seeing a relatively strong inelasticity on the demand for those best tickets.  And then on the onsite, I think because we're seeing it come from a number of fronts, we are confident that it's staying. So, we talked about it in the comments, right. Moving from cash to cashless just opens up increase spend. It's been a long existing difference between those 2 moving to a 100% cashless, just raises the average because instead of being half of each. And then we're seeing again structural trends people are going to a bit higher quality in terms of some of the alcohol, some of our product offerings are making more of a deal for people to take higher price point products.  All of those we think are a continuation of the trends that we've seen over the past several years and have no reason to expect that that would be any different going forward. In terms of the cadence for shows next year in general, and Michael talked about this a bit. You'll see similar where Q2 and Q3 will continue to be our strongest quarters. That's when we'll have a great stadium next year. It looks to be far and away the largest stadium we've ever -- we've had. That will be primarily in those Q2, Q3 outdoor months. Obviously, our amphitheaters and festivals, largely those months. And even the arena certainly here in the U.S. you just have more avails in those months because of the timing of the sport season. So, there's no reason not to expect similar seasonality in general as we've had historically. Stephen Laszczyk : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen, please proceed with your question. Stephen Glagola : Yes. Thank you. Joe on the ticketing segment that you had another great quarter, margins were at 46% on AOI. I know you said prior the Q2 is 40% margin shouldn't be extrapolated. And I know you love talking about margins, but I just wanted to see if you had an update on that mid-single-digit margin expansion that you talked about prior on annualized basis. Is that still how we should be thinking about the ticketing business coming out of the pandemic or are we talking about something higher than that now? Joe Berchtold : Well, I think we absolutely believe you'll continue to expect to see higher than historical margins because of the cost reductions. This year you've -- this quarter you've got the particular benefit of a few things, one being that we ramped up our activity faster than we ramped up our staff. As we said, we were doing from our cost management so we pushed our people and extracted more from that side. And secondly, as we also talked, this is much more of a U.S. driven, and then secondly UK driven, and we've talked historically about the fact that the U.S. market is a higher service fee and therefore generally a higher margin market than internationally. So, some of that mix shift will convert back next year. I don't think we're ready to give exact numbers, but we certainly do think that the ticketing margin will improve relative to historical. Stephen Glagola : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. David Katz : Hi, evening everyone, and thanks for taking my question. With everything going as well as it has, and the numbers starting to materialize, I wanted to ask a little bit longer term, like 2023, And if there's any evidence to support the trajectory continuing to move up. In 2023, I think Joe, you may have used the phrase at one point, there's no air pocket out there. Any help there would be welcome. Michael Rapino : Yes. I think to Joe's point, I think we've said it before. The good news is '22 is going to probably be a record year, but there's only so many Fridays and Saturdays and artists are pretty smart about how they route their tours and how they look at the world and find their right positioning. So, it\u2019s kind of self-regulates itself. You're never going to have a bunch of tours on the same weekend piled on.  So that just meant we have a more inventory to spread into '22, '23, and we're talking '24 now. So, I would say we have a backlog that needs to still work through the system in '22, '23. which will be incredibly strong years. And then we continue to get back to regular -- we've had over the year, double-digit growth in the live entertainment space ongoing. We project that to continue both on pricing and global volume as demand and supply continues to grow around the world. David Katz : Thank you for that. And if -- Michael, if I may just follow-up on the prospective deal front. I think when we last spoke, activity in terms of potential acquisitions were starting to ramp up again and become more active. Any update there that's worth sharing? Michael Rapino : If you follow my Twitter, or what we're up to, we've been pretty active. We're back with our backlog of 30 to 40 things around the world. We're looking at that can keep propelling our business and growing our scale. So good pipe -- good pipeline will continue to be very aggressive at growing our global market share and then monetizing products on top of it. David Katz : Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Sundby with William Blair, please proceed with your question. Ryan Sundby : Hey, Michael. Hi, Jeff. Thanks for taking my question. If you look at the 14 million net new fee-bearing customers that Ticketmaster\u2019s added this year so far, what's been the primary drivers for growing that business? Are they looking for digital ticketing? Was there a change and particularly during COVID and then with 2/3 of them being international and finally, are these exclusive taking partners any color there would be great. Joe Berchtold : Sure. as you said, 2/3 of them international, I think is indicative of particularly in the international markets. Just what a strong leadership position Ticketmaster has with a lot of the investments we've been making over the past 5 years. So digital ticketing, as you said, is -- overnight goes from being a nice feature to a critical part of it because you're moving away from contactless of any sort, you need a digital ticket, and our leadership there is a big differentiator, we've been investing for a long time, we're not trying to play catch-up. And these tickets are a mix of where we have the full allocation in some markets and other markets, we have a partial allocation. But in aggregate it's adding 14 million tickets to the portfolio. Michael Rapino : William, I would just add I don't want to ever forget that Ticketmaster is incredibly great at what they do on a global basis. If you're -- if you own a stadium, an arena, high-volume ticket business with complex season owners and regular tickets -- it's a complex business to do at scale. So, a lot of our customers, sometimes we may lose a customer, they end up coming back.  So, one, I just want to remind you, we've been investing in this platform for the last few years. Our enterprise platform is a world-class platform. The U.S. ticket market is the most complicated market in the world. Reserved seats equal season seats are a complex model to manage the 10 AM on on-sale with box and all the things that pressure your system so when at the core enterprise platform is really good. So, we're more out competing for that offering. We end up just being ultimately winning the business because we are the best at it.  And we see that because we see the clients that may leave. But end up coming back because the functionality that we provide is superior to others. We're seeing this in a Brooklyn arena last week where the competitor was trying to do a presale that broke and that's a pretty basic stuff. So, I just remind people we are in a global basis, the best of what we do. That's why clients pick us. And then we happen to be global and opening up all of our technology to a global base is going to be our great runway for the next while. Ryan Sundby : Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And then just sequencing at this past quarter, it didn't sound like you called out a big impact from Delta here. Did you feel?  And did you see a rebound then I guess as you move, pass it further out? Joe Berchtold : I think every month for us, we continue to see ongoing growth in the reopening, so it'd be hard to separate out Delta specifically versus reopening in general. But everything that we saw was more fans going to more shows consistently, contrary to some of the press I've seen very low no show rates, low to low single-digit increases in terms of no-shows as a result of the pandemic. So, it seems that the people that want to go to the shows are going to the shows. And that's just continue to grow as a portion of the fan base out there. Ryan Sundby : That's good to hear. Thanks for the questions. Michael Rapino : And to Joe's point, I would just add what you also noticed is the -- it's all different genres in ages. So, this isn't just young kids are going to shows because they're not scared but the Eagles just had a wildly successful on arena tour that's going to finish up this week in Seattle. The Grateful Dead route doing full stadiums. Harry Styles obviously doing indoors to just record business as well as our amphitheater business.  So, we did -- we weren't sure going into the market what segment or what age demo would react differently, or if there would be a difference, and we saw huge demand across the board at all ages, all demos, all markets. So strong rebound back as we've seen with the early on sales going forward. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. The past two years have only reinforced the power of live music, and it\u2019s been great to see artists and fans reconnecting at scale around the world. Over the course of 2021, we saw the strength of live events. The year started in the midst of the pandemic, but by summer fans were returning to shows, and by the end of the year, we had a record pipeline of concerts, ticket sales and advertising commitments for 2022. Restarting our concerts business in the second half of the year, we put over 17,000 concerts for 35 million fans in 2021, mainly in the U.S. and UK markets. In the final five months of the year, in the U.S. and UK, we had over 15 million fans attend our outdoor events : festivals, stadiums, and amphitheaters, nearly 25% higher than during the same period in 2019. Through the ramp up, we saw demand driven price increases, particularly with platinum and other front of the house ticket pricing. Fans continue to seek the best tickets, and the ongoing rapid growth of the secondary market indicates there\u2019s more room to grow. Fans on-site also continued spending more, with average per fan revenue up double digits for the year relative to 2019 levels, across each of amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs. And as shows came back, so did the desire of brands to connect to our fans. As a result, sponsorship and advertising AOI was roughly the same for the second half of 2021 as it was in 2019, which was a record level. This interest came from a mix of expanding long-term relationships with brands such as Bacardi, Heineken and O2, as well as adding new partners, including Coinbase, Hulu and Cinch. Our ticketing business had the dual benefit of strong ticket sales for events in 2021, while also being the first of our businesses to benefit from our 2022 pipeline. Ticket sales were at a record pace across every metric with October, November and December being our top three months ever for ticketing GTV, excluding refunds. And the fourth quarter and second half of the year also set records for a quarter and six-month period. At the same time, we continued to reorganize our business globally and improve our operations, establishing a more nimble and lower cost company. Looking to 2022 and beyond, with the strength in ticket sales, not surprisingly, we are seeing every leading indicator for 2022 up relative to 2019, reinforcing our confidence that we will have a record year in 2022 that sets us up for growth over the next several years. Helping accelerate our growth this year is the acquisition of OCESA, which gives us immediate scale in Mexico and establishes another path into a broader Latin American market. Looking at the leading indicators, starting with show count through February, we are up 30% relative to 2019 across our large venue shows, for stadium, amphitheater, arena and festivals. Ticket sales through mid-February, we have sold 45 million tickets for shows this year, up 45% from 2019. We already have eight artists selling over 500,000 tickets for tours this year, including Bad Bunny, Dua Lipa and Billie Eilish. And fans are coming to the shows, our most recent data over the past month indicates no-show rates at our concerts in the U.S. are back to 2019 levels, eliminating any lingering questions on the resilience of fan demand. Along with our fan growth, we continue building the portfolio of venues we operate, now at 320 globally, as we net added 31 additional venues in 2021, approximately half of which came through the OCESA acquisition. Building our venue portfolio enables us to more rapidly grow our show count and fan base in 2022, and over the next few years, and positions us to drive on-site spending more widely while also providing additional assets to brand partners. Our sponsorship and advertising pipeline is similarly set for a strong 2022, up double digits through mid-February relative to 2019, with 80% of our planned revenue for the year committed. Taking this strong activity pipeline and combining it with our more efficient cost structure, I expect 2022 to deliver record financial performance overall for each division. The two-year wait for artists and fans is over. Never have the tailwinds to our business been so strong, and I believe this is just the start of what will be the strongest multi-year period for the concert industry. With that I will let Joe take you through more details on our results. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the unique seasonality we experienced last year, I\u2019ll provide an overview of our annual results, but also give some specifics on the fourth quarter as we believe that is a better indicator of what lies ahead for 2022 and beyond. Overall, our AOI of $324 million for the year was $1.3 billion better than 2020, led by an improvement of $800 million in ticketing, over $400 million in concerts and $150 million in sponsorship. For the fourth quarter, we delivered AOI of $160 million, led by a record quarterly AOI results in ticketing and strong performance in sponsorship. On the balance sheet, we ended the year with $1.5 billion in free cash and $2.3 billion in event-related deferred revenue. This deferred revenue is almost twice the level of Q4 2019, giving us one of several leading indicators for how strong 2022 is lucky. Let me give a bit more color on each division and then I will give you more on the 2022 leading indicators. First, in concerts, we had 16 million fans attend 9,300 events in the quarter, continuing to be led by the U.S. and the UK, which accounted for almost 90% of these fans. The strength of fan spending we discussed in Q3 continued through Q4, with consistent increases in ticket pricing and average per fan spending. Concert ticket pricing was up 11% overall for the year relative to 2019 14% in North America. As demand in many major venue types : amphitheaters, stadiums and festivals showed strong increases as we put more tickets in market-based platinum and VIP pricing offers. Similarly, average fan spending at our amphitheaters ended up in line with last quarter\u2019s commentary at $37 for the year, up 25% from 2019. While this was helped by fewer promotions, it was largely driven by higher purchases. His average fan spending increased across the Board from food and beverage, ticket add-ons, VIP and parking. For our major festivals, average spending per fan also rose double digits, largely as a result of higher food and beverage in VIP sale. Finally, as we also noted last quarter, operating costs per fan were up due to lower operating scale from fewer shows per venue, along with labor cost increases. But overall, our contribution margin per fan was up double digits as pricing on-site spending another revenue more than covered any incremental costs. Next sponsorship, largely followed concerts returned to activity over the course of the year and into the fourth quarter. As a result, 2021 sponsorship and advertising AOI of $242 million was about two-thirds of 2019 levels, while Q4 AOI of $115 million was 39% higher in 2019 Q4. This strength comes across on-site and online, as both parts of the business delivered record Q4 AOI. Again, our large festivals were a standout performer, increasing sponsorship revenue per fan by over 10% versus the same festivals in 2019. Finally, ticketing was clearly the star of the quarter, delivering $212 million of AOI, which surpassed its previous best quarter Q3 of this year by over 20% and was 60% higher than Q4 2019, which was our previous best Q4. Ticketing success was across the Board. Let me give you a few key statistics for the quarter. Transacted ticket volume, excluding refunds, were 65 million tickets, coming in even higher than Q4 2019. Transacted ticketing GTV, excluding refunds, was $6.6 billion, 20% higher than Q4 2019. This was driven by concerts and sporting events, whose GTV were up 22% and 55%, respectively. Price increases help drive the GTV levels, with average ticket prices up 17% for the fourth quarter relative to Q4 2019, in concerts and sporting event, ticketing, pricing, each app approximately 20%. Our growth came from both primary and secondary ticketing, with transacted GTV, excluding refunds, up 16% and 49%, respectively. And we added 17 million net new fee-bearing tickets from new clients to the marketplace in 2021, with most of that inventory coming online this year. And finally, our ongoing cost management help drive ticketing into Q4 results operating at substantially lower fixed costs in Q4 2019, as we both structurally reduced costs and also held the line on other costs being added back until we saw ticket sales fully return. As we look to 2022, first OCESA will benefit full year results as Mexico seen live events starting to return. Most notably their contribution will flow through our sponsorship and ticketing division. Looking at our leading indicators through mid-February 1, confirmed large venue show bookings were up 30% overall and double digits for each amphitheaters, arenas, stadiums and festivals. Second, we have sold 45 million tickets for concerts this year, up 45% from this point in 2019. While it\u2019s too early to have much data on ticket pricing, early indicators continue to show the inelasticity of demand for the best tickets. Looking at our top 10 concert tours this year versus this point in 2019, average pricing is up over 20% as our average platinum allocation has increased substantially. And looking at secondary ticketing demand in Ticketmaster, five of their top 10 highest demand events ever have taken place in 2022, signaling that secondary markets continue to grow even faster than primary tickets. On the sponsorship side, commitments are up double digits from this point in 2019 prior to including OCESA. And overall, we have more than 80% of our planned sponsorship net revenue for 2022 already committed. A few other 2022 points, we continue to maintain a lower cost structure, and this takes into account labor cost increases within our perimeter as at the start of 2020. But obviously, adding new businesses, including OCESA, will come with additional fixed costs. And from a seasonality standpoint, we\u2019re going to be even more Q2 and Q3-driven this year than usual. Q1 activities historically very arena-driven with limited outdoor activity. And as we plan the arena tours for this year, we had most of them starting Q2 instead of Q1 to give the international markets time to fully open. It appears we plan that correctly, we continue to be on track with those plans, and certainly the leading indicators suggests the full year will be at record fan levels, but with somewhat lower concert activity this Q1 versus 2019. In anticipation of the growth opportunities ahead of us this year, we expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million, with two-thirds of this spent on revenue-generating projects. In addition, we ended 2021 with $2.1 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to invest in growth. We are comfortable with our current leverage, and we\u2019ll continue to reevaluate our balance sheet on an ongoing basis. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please state your question. David Karnovsky : Hey, thank you. Some of forward commentary wrote 45% increase in ticket sold versus 30% increase in large venue supply. I\u2019m wondering to understand more of what you\u2019re seeing on the demand side, given your own customer data, the average concert goers buying more shows than they were buying earlier. Are you seeing more first-time concert goers, any additional you could provide would be great? Joe Berchtold : Yeah, this is Joe. We\u2019re certainly seeing them buy earlier. We\u2019re seeing these numbers benefit from the pent-up supply and the pent-up demand that exists out in the marketplace. I think given that we\u2019re just getting going, it\u2019s probably too early to call whether they\u2019re going to multiple concerts more likely, I think, we\u2019re going to have to play through the year and see more data before we can really make that determination. David Karnovsky : Okay. And then you told the assessment for a few months now, would just be interested to hear any update on how you view the asset in terms of revenue synergies or how maybe their cost structure looks relative to when you first executed the deal in 2019? And then could you provide an update on how we should think about the Mexico market ramp-up? Joe Berchtold : Yeah, I think we continue to be very excited by assessment. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time with their team. We do think the top line opportunities are exactly as we\u2019ve been laying out. First, we have the opportunity to bring more of our terrain through Mexico was a natural part of our terrain activities. And then second, because of their great strength with LatinX, which are red hot right now, more opportunities to build our market share in the Latin business and bring those into not just Mexico, but in the U.S. So we\u2019re excited about that top line opportunity. They\u2019re getting going as we get into Q2, they\u2019ll get going first with festivals, and then ramp-up the touring business. We expect them to have a very good year, this year. Again, the way they\u2019re structured, their economics really flow through \u2013 their \u2013 if you look at them, their sponsorship and their ticketing divisions, but we expect them to have a very solid year. David Karnovsky : And anything on the cost side, I mean, you see on their commentary sort of indicated taking out a lot of expenses during the pandemic as well. I wasn\u2019t sure if we should be thinking of the kind of AOI structure that business is different than maybe it exists to pre-pandemic? Joe Berchtold : I think it\u2019s probably premature to change your cost structure assumptions with them. As we further integrate Ticketmaster, I would expect that and as we get the concert machine more finely tuned that expected, but it\u2019s \u2013 the first focus is driving the top line. if we get the top line right, that business will do great, and then we\u2019ll follow with costs. We\u2019re not going to start with cost because you can\u2019t pick it \u2013 you can\u2019t catch up this year. Michael Rapino : And it\u2019s Michael stepping in. And also, we know this company very well. Alex , the CEO is a professional. You don\u2019t get to be the third largest promoter in the world without being kind of an all round good businessman and operator. So he runs an incredible good business. But yes, like myself and our team through COVID, he was able to dig in and decide what\u2019s \u2013 where\u2019s some rust and some bureaucracy? And how can we streamline some of the business? So like us, I would expect him to hold on to some cost savings and run more efficient, regardless of the merger. And we think now together, we\u2019ve already started the process of how do we elevate the ticket business? How do we upgrade the software? How do we introduce secondary? How do we excel the hospitality and sponsorship business? So I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some cost savings, but we\u2019re more excited about, as Joe said, we think we can bring another gear to his already well-run machine. David Karnovsky : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question. Stephen Laszczyk : Great, thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit more about international and maybe from Michael, could you give us an update on when you expect concerts to resume at scale across your global footprint? I know you laid out a timeline late last year. But I was curious if that changed at all, given the latest COVID wave? And then if all that goes according to plan, how do you expect your international business in 2022 will compare to 2020 \u2013 2019? Michael Rapino : You know, and I will preface here. We have our Investor Day tomorrow. So we\u2019re going to dig into all of these topics probably in much more detail. So if we\u2019re a little shorter tonight, just expect us tomorrow, you\u2019ll have a much more opportunity to dig into all of these levers. International, it looks like everything is opening up fast and we see a full summer/spring business across the globe. Australia and New Zealand have only been \u2013 has been the only real I would say slower some of the Pacific Rim a little slower in some of the markets, China, Japan. But for our business, we think most of the business across Europe, international, South America, we start Coldplay March 18 in Costa Rica going down to Latin America. We believe most of our big Lollapalooza is in South America in March and April will happen. And all of our summer festivals in Europe are scheduled to happen. So it looks like 70% to 80% of the business around the world will be open, little bit of Pacific Rim might have some delays. Stephen Laszczyk : Got it. Thanks for that. And then just one on sponsorship and advertising. Could you maybe give us an idea on what the remaining inventory in 2022 looks like? Is it inventory from earlier in the year, later in the year? What types of tours are formats? And then I know some of your sponsorship and advertising relationships can be multi-year in nature. Is there anything you can tell us about how the funnel shaping up for 2023 and beyond? Joe Berchtold : Yeah, in terms of remaining inventory, as you know, a lot of our inventory is what we create and what our sponsorship team has the ability to come up with ideas for how we expand into new categories, and how we take existing categories and break them down in pieces. So we don\u2019t feel generally speaking inventory constrained. The team is often working on a variety of areas, fintech and others that we think can steer still deliver a lot this year and into next year. As Michael said, we\u2019ll get more into that tomorrow. But we still think there\u2019s a great runway in that business. And as you also noted, a lot of these deals are multi-year. So as we establish a new baseline this year, we just have the opportunity to keep growing from that next year and beyond. Stephen Laszczyk : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please go ahead. Brandon Ross : Yeah. Thank you, guys. So ticket pricing for the top 10 tours you said was up, I think, 20% over 2019, and we definitely took notice when you use the word inelasticity in your prepared remarks. Platinum is obviously a big part of what you\u2019re doing there. Can you frame where you are in unlocking tailwinds from Platinum tickets specifically? What percentage of major artists are you using it? And how much further impact do you see platinum having over time? Joe Berchtold : Well, I think, again, Brandon, you\u2019ll be there tomorrow. Well I think you just have to look at the size of the prize right now. I mean, if you look at it, just from a secondary perspective, how much unrealized underpriced are the tickets, unrealized pricing opportunity, if you want to call it. So I would say right now, Platinum is adopting a great tool to get a higher ticket price, but we still have very low penetration across a global business, huge upside still. Brandon Ross : Okay. And then there have been a lot of reports about insurance rates going up, especially because of COVID and the Travis Scott incident, et cetera. Can you comment on how impactful you expect that to be to your cost structure this year and going forward? Joe Berchtold : Yeah, this is Joe. We see what everybody else sees, which is yes, insurance costs going up. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s material to the business overall. I think we\u2019re in a good position as it relates to inflation more broadly. If you look at inflation of inputs versus your ability to price on the outputs, I think, we\u2019re in a very good position that while you have some price pressures on your inputs, whether it\u2019s insurance or labor. We have, for your first question, a much greater level of pricing ability on the outside, which led us as we talked about, use the same logic as we had last summer at the amps, still drove CM per fan up double digits. So we\u2019re watching every cost is everybody else\u2019s, we understand which ones are movie where, and we\u2019re just figuring out how we make sure we\u2019re pricing overall to to keep our AOI. Brandon Ross : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Katz : Evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just two interesting things I wanted to go back to and hope you could elaborate on. One is, you talked about the lower cost structure and you said that, I think, Joe, that it includes some labor cost increases. Can you just elaborate a bit more on what kinds of labor costs those is \u2013 and those are and where they are from in magnitude, et cetera? Joe Berchtold : Sure. We like every business. I\u2019ve seen employees are demanding some higher wages as you\u2019ve come back from COVID. And as we built our cost \u2013 structural cost savings, we knew that was going to be the case. And we built that in and we talked in the past about the levels of those cost savings. So I just rather than get into every quarter trying to reconcile for you guys, well, how does your cost of living adjustment this year impact your structural savings? I want to make it clear we\u2019re delivering those savings, having expected that there was going to be some labor cost increases as we were going through, no different for us than anybody else. David Katz : Understood. And the second issue I wanted to touch on is I think you mentioned that the secondary ticket market is going faster than primary. I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s driving that and what order of magnitude there as well? Joe Berchtold : Well, yeah, it\u2019s the same point as what Brandon asked about. It\u2019s the inelasticity of demand for the best tickets, plus the general overall desire for fans to get back to live events. So if they didn\u2019t buy a ticket for the sporting event, or for the concert, they missed out, they\u2019re buying it on secondary, and they\u2019re paying whatever it takes on those best tickets to get in. So as we strive on the primary to be pricing it such that to bring the dollars back the content to the artists, so we think deserve every dollar for their performance. We\u2019re doing that through platinum and through other tools. As we do that, secondary continues to grow rapidly. We\u2019re not shrinking secondary yet. So we have the opportunity to continue to move pricing and primary as I was talking about earlier, while looking at secondary and figuring out how far do we go. David Katz : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Please state your question. Stephen Glagola : Hi, thanks for the question. There\u2019s been some reports that the industry has been recently seen 20% no-show rates at concerts. And you noted in your prepared remarks and no-show rates that Live Nation promoted concerts in the U.S. are back to 2019 levels. Just want to ask like what are those levels if you can pinpoint it? And can you reconcile maybe if there is a divergence between what you\u2019re seeing and what the industry is seeing, and how no-show rates are trending internationally? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : So let me give you some facts on that. Thanks for that question. Because I think there\u2019s been a lot of reporting by anecdote out there, as opposed to reporting by collective facts. And I don\u2019t think our experience is any different than the industry is, as a total. I think that on occasion, you have aberrations for a variety of reasons. But just to give you a macro feel, I\u2019ll give you the \u2013 for first of all, arenas in 2019, if you look at the number of people that showed up for a concert versus the number of people that bought tickets, it ran at 93% in 2019. That number thus far, in 2022, over the past six weeks is running at 91%. So not materially different from the 93% for the total of 2019. For our theaters and clubs, the smaller shows, you tend to have a slightly higher no-show rate. And that number was 87% in 2019. It\u2019s running at 83% in 2022. So I think if you first of all recognize that there were a number of shows that have taken place over the past few months that were rescheduled, and when shows get rescheduled, people will naturally forget about the show or have a conflict different than what they originally had. It\u2019s probable that accounts for all or almost all of that difference in the attendance level. So we don\u2019t think that reporting is at all accurate. Stephen Glagola : Appreciate the color, Joe. And can you just provide\u2026 Michael Rapino : Just had that color that I remember reading those articles, they dramatize, I think they were saying as 15%, 20% weren\u2019t showing, but again, they weren\u2019t taking into account that on a normal year, 7%, 8% of people don\u2019t show up to shows. So you\u2019re already starting at that level. So if you look at what our current data says, we\u2019re basically back to 2019 levels and people are showing up at the same rates are not showing up in that 7% to 8%. The history has always kind of shown. Stephen Glagola : Thanks, Michael. And can you guys just provide on Q4 concerts, the AOI margin was a little bit, the loss I think was a little wider and some expectations. I know you have \u2013 I think you have advertising dollars that flowed through there. But can you maybe just any comments on that, which drove that? And then how should we think about Q4 and I know it\u2019s far away, but 2022 as well as that could be just similar cadence of losses in that quarter for concerts? Joe Berchtold : I mean, I think if you look at Q4 versus 2019, you \u2013 Q4 is generally a loss. It\u2019s a lower activity quarter. You have, as you noted, prepaid advertising running through. If you look at our fan base in 2021 versus 2019, Q4 back that off. It\u2019s not surprising, you\u2019re still carrying your fixed cost plus you have your end advertising all against the lower volume. Stephen Glagola : All right, Thanks, Joe, and looking forward to the Investor Day Tomorrow. Joe Berchtold : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ben Swinburne : Thanks. Good afternoon. I had a couple of questions. First, Michael, I also noticed you mentioned the secondary market growing faster than primary a couple of times in your prepared remarks. And I was thinking of Ticketmaster as the clear market leader in primary and I know you\u2019re in secondary, but I \u2013 maybe I just don\u2019t think about Ticketmaster as the leading, is particularly focused on the secondary market. I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk about whether you see that accurately as I described it, or if you think you \u2013 there\u2019s anything you would change in the strategy for that business going forward, given what we\u2019re seeing in secondary, I noticed Joe also mentioned, we haven\u2019t seen the secondary shrink yet. So maybe that\u2019s tells me the answer. But I\u2019m just wondering if you guys are pivoting at all, as you think about the growth of those two parts of the ticketing business, because it does seem like secondary is quite robust? Michael Rapino : Yeah, I would \u2013 we\u2019ll get into this tomorrow, again, in our slides, but we have the two sides of the equation here, right? Ultimately, long-term. I don\u2019t think secondary is a great business, because I believe content will figure out how to price it better. So on the concert side, we\u2019re waking up every day, our goal isn\u2019t to increase secondary sales, it\u2019s to increase the gross for the artists in the show. That\u2019s why we talked about platinum and VIP and better analysis for the artist to capture more of the dollars. So \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen that over the last 5, 10 years, every year, the artist is capturing more of it. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s an efficient market yet. It\u2019s going to take some more time for the artist to be more comfortable charging those prices where the market is affected, but it\u2019s happening you see it over time. And then 5, 10 years from now, if you are an artist manager, you wouldn\u2019t want to be waking up seeing lots of secondary tickets for your artists captured outside of your bundle. So our job mostly is to figure out how to get all of that secondary into the primary bucket for the artist. So they make the dollars and then we, obviously, that fires our flywheel. But the reality is, it\u2019s not an efficient market yet. And most of secondary is really in the sports business. So when we talk about the ticket side growing, we were never in secondary, as you said, when we took this business over. We integrated it, we built it, and we \u2013 and then we ramped it up fast for all of our sports clients. So we\u2019re the official secondary of the NFL, the NBA of the NHL, and others. And we have been able to grow that business over the last few years, fairly well in the sports business where most of the dollars are. So that business though, again, continues to be a business where the sports teams are getting more and more dollars directly. The NBA, the NFL are all looking at ways to capture the secondary for the team and/or for the league. So we think it\u2019s a business right now that is in transition, lots of dollars outside of the content. We think long-term content captures more of it. But we\u2019re also going to be part of that marketplace that if a fan or somebody wants to trade and sell their tickets, then we want to make sure we\u2019re part of that vertical solution at our marketplace. Ben Swinburne : Got it. That makes sense. And then just wanted to go back to the forward bookings, numbers and leading indicators you guys talked about the 45% and the 30%. We heard some stats at least directionally similar on NSGs call, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a timing element to this. Just should we be extrapolating those into full year growth rates? Or are we seeing some activity happening sooner because we\u2019re still sort of dealing with the pandemic hangover or the pandemic? And so concerts are filling up the calendar sooner and going on sale sooner. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any sort of caveat you\u2019d want to give us to think about translating those into a forecast? That makes sense? Joe Berchtold : Yeah, I certainly don\u2019t think of it as a caveat. But unquestionably, you\u2019ve got a timing advantage this year, you\u2019ve got a benefit from some shows that moved and you have a timing in general of a wide open market that we put shows on sale earlier. But that said, we look at all of that and we continue to see every indicator well up. So we think it\u2019ll plateau or normalize some, but it\u2019s still looking to be a very strong high growth relative to 2019. Ben Swinburne : Yep, makes sense. Thanks, guys. Joe Berchtold : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please go ahead with your question. Ryan Sundby : Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Just wanted to follow-up on the 25% growth in the U.S. and UK fan base over the last five months. Are there any comparison issues there we should think through in terms of maybe show count or, or mix of festivals that got moved around? We set a pretty apples-to-apples comparison. Ryan Sundby : Yeah, so just to be fair, that was the outdoor activity over the last five months of last year. So stadiums, amphitheaters and festivals, there was definitely some benefits. You got a few festivals like Electric Daisy that moved into the fourth quarter from May and we pushed the amphitheater season later in the year. So I wouldn\u2019t try to take anything arithmetically from that as much as a very \u2013 2021 was a year of very strong fan return to outdoor events. 2022 setting up to be a very strong fan return to every site, every sort of venue, every sort of event. Ryan Sundby : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, in terms of the average fan revenue up double digits this year, I guess, I know, it\u2019s kind of early to make a call last quarter, but now that you\u2019ve had some more time to kind of look at the data there. Is that something you think you can hold on to permanently, or do you think this is some kind of indulgent spinning that we\u2019re seeing here just that number? Joe Berchtold : We think overall that number is real. We think that there is higher fan spending and there is greater fan acceptance of some higher pricing and there\u2019s greater fan demand for real hospitality some higher end luxuries. We gave some specific math last time that wouldn\u2019t have changed much in terms of what was the incremental span versus what was some mix issues, but it is largely what fans spending more money at out the shows and we think that continues. Ryan Sundby : Okay. That\u2019s good to hear. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Jason Bazinet : If there was one mistake that I think investors make during COVID, it was sort of taking strength that we saw during the COVID period and sort of extrapolating it into future periods. And I\u2019m just wondering, when you guys look at the very robust numbers that you\u2019re putting up and all those leading indicators, how you guys sort of parsing out the sort of we\u2019ve all been locked up for two years, or we\u2019re going to go out and go crazy and spend a lot of money on food and beverage and merch and pay a higher price to get a premium seat versus everything sort of settling down to the sort of long run averages. Like do you think there\u2019s that dynamic going on? Or do you think this is really like something a permanent shift in sort of consumers behavior? Joe Berchtold : Well, I think the first thing you got to start with, Jason, is we don\u2019t have a hockey stick. We\u2019re not a COVID business that was floating along with near zero, and all of a sudden took off like a hockey stick. And everybody thought the hockey stick was going to continue forever. When you look at the long-term growth of the business, start with the most macro of GDP spending on goods shifting to experience, on increased demand for luxuries, on desire to go to concerts, on increased ticket pricing to concerts, everything on a global basis, s Michael said, all of this has been we\u2019ve been drawing the same chart since 2010. And most of our investors today, I think, have been looking at that chart and saying the best predictor of the future is the past. And we had a very bumpy couple of years from macro over time. This is a company and this is an industry that is able between their tailwinds, their ability to drive increase market share, their ability to drive global, to bring the supply to the latent demand that exists in the marketplace to continue to grow the business. Jason Bazinet : I don\u2019t disagree with anything you said. If I can just sort of give you observations, we\u2019re seeing like a record per caps in inside movie theaters and regional theme parks and things that don\u2019t have that same sort of tailwinds. Joe Berchtold : But Jason, had those businesses that they tell you for the past five years, they went from $18 to $22 to $24 to $26 to $29. I mean, do they tell you \u2013 do they give you for the past six years, every year how they were consistently delivering growth? So we could debate is that growth rate continued? Is there some normalization? Is there a reversion to a mean over a number of years? You can have all of those debates, but don\u2019t frame it as a hockey stick, or somehow as the bumps in the road, the world is going to collapse back down to $18. I think you got to give us the credit that we\u2019ve set a strategy and we\u2019ve executed very consistently for a considerable period, and delivered on sustained growth. So yes, there\u2019s some catch up of a couple of years, because 2020 and 2021 didn\u2019t exist as much. Sure. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re aberrations. Jason Bazinet : I don\u2019t mean aberrations, but I just I mean, maybe we\u2019ll learn more about this tomorrow. But it just seems like to comp, if we have these really robust numbers this year, I\u2019d just be curious what counsel you have, as we think about 2023 and 2024 to build off those elevated numbers not taking away from\u2026 Joe Berchtold : So right now, I have in front of me a list of 40 some tours for 2023 that are either confirmed or in our pipeline. Normally, at this point, a year from earlier, we\u2019d have a list of five to 10. So yes, we have a lot of confidence that 2023 and beyond look very good because there is a lot of pent-up supply, there is a lot of pent-up demand, and we expect it\u2019s a multi-year run. Jason Bazinet : Awesome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question for today. And that also concludes today\u2019s conference. All parties may now disconnect. Have a great evening. Thank you.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Momentum has picked up for all of our businesses over the course of the first quarter. And as a result, we have delivered financial performance that greatly surpassed our previous expectations with AOI of $209 million. Artists are back on the road and fan demand has never been stronger. The reflection of live events remain a clear priority for consumers as our social lives restart. Ticket buying serves as a leading indicator to our overall business. Ticketmaster's strong first quarter performance drove the company's overall profitability and shows how well our concert and sponsorship businesses are positioned to deliver record results this year. Despite some markets taking longer to reopen, the quarter was our second highest ever we transacted GTV, excluding refunds, trailing only Q4 2021 with March being our highest transacted GTV month ever. In primary ticketing, we're now benefiting from the 17 million new fee-bearing tickets we gained in 2021, which helped us drive transacted GTV for the quarter up 33% relative to 2019. This quarter was also added 7 million new additional tickets through new contracts with Venues as well as content creators, setting us up for ongoing growth this year and into 2023. Our secondary ticketing GTV growth was even higher up 106% relative to 2019 driven largely by average retail ticket price up 20% relative to 2019 and a tremendous fan demand pushed up the market pricing, Ticketmaster, gaining additional market share by effectively leveraging its team and league partnerships across NFL, NBA and other sporting events. And the market continued growing at double-digit pace, demonstrating high demand for live events, as well as how much runway there is for continued pricing, efficiently. Fan demand and signing of new contracts accelerated even faster than expected this quarter, reinforcing the Ticketmaster as the enterprise platform for choice of teams, artists and content creators, and continuing to be the most effective fan marketplace. Our sponsorship activity fully returned in Q1, delivering financial results that well exceeded 2019. We're seeing growth across a number of dimensions, expansion of existing relationships, new categories expanding our breadth to partners and new ad units being created both onsite and online. The number of strategic sponsors that generated over $1 million of revenue per year has risen by almost 30% since 2019. With our committed span up 70% and accounting for 80% of our total sponsorship revenue, about 60% of this growth has come from three categories of particular priority over the past two years; technology, telecom and purchase path integration, which has collectively more than doubled their sponsorships since 2019. Much of our focus with brand partners is how we collectively elevate the fan experience. We've had great success with this in recent years. And so far this year through our partnership with Verizon, we started powering our Venues with cutting edge 5G connectivity and are launching initiative with Snap to give artists augmented reality capabilities at shows and festivals. At this point, sponsorship sales are up double digits relative to 2019, and we have a solid 90% of our planned sponsored for the year, positioning us for continued strong financial performance. The concert division, all leading indicators, point to double-digit growth and fan attendance at our concerts relative to 2019. Approximately 11 million fans attended our shows in the first quarter compared to 15 million fans in 2019. This was expected as we planned for limited concert activity in the early months of the year to allow for markets to open. But more importantly, we continue to build our flywheel with over 70 million tickets now sold for shows in 2022, up to 36 million, compared to 2019 and committed show count is up 44% through the end of April, relative to 19%, setting us up for continued ticket sales over the year. We continue to see the fans are showing up for the concerts they have tickets for, with attendance rates in the US across all venue types at 2019 levels with no shows generally in the low mid-single digits. The industry continues to embrace market-based pricing, particularly on the best tickets, shifting $500 million to artists for shows this year, resulting from a double-digit increase in ticket pricing and reducing the price arbitrage in the secondary market. At the same time in the US, the average entry level price to get in and enjoy the show remains under $35, approachable for almost all fans. Early reads on consumer spending on our shows across the US and UK also indicate fans continue their spending when they get to the show. We had two million fans at 10 shows at our theaters and clubs in the first quarter with average per fan revenue up 30% relative to 2019. And we've had four festivals over the past few months to lean over 300,000 fans with average per fan revenue up 30% also. Looking ahead to the summer and the rest of the year, we remain optimistic that we are just getting going as all leading indicators reinforce record activity levels and financial results. Ticket sales were at record levels in Q1 with momentum building over February and March. We sold almost 20 million more tickets to our concerts this year in this point in time in 2019, with large number of tours still to go on sale and concert fans are showing no sign of slowing down. They're paying for the best tickets, attending the shows and spending more on site as they create lifetime memories. We're continuing to build Venue Nation, our platform of operated Venues with a pipeline of 20 Venues, including the recently open Moody Center in Austin, in addition to adding 38 more festivals this year. Sponsors are looking to spend more this year on live entertainment than ever and Live Nation's scale and global platform is making us the partner of choice. While the US and UK have driven much of our activity over the past year, the rest of the world is now rapidly opening up. Assess this financial performance for the quarter, exceeded its 2019 results and both Latin America and Western Europe are expected to have record attendance for our concerts this year. I continue to expect this just to be the start of our run, the global addressable markets for concerts, ticketing and sponsorship, all provide a long runway for continued growth. We have over 60 tours already under discussion for 2023, our earliest indicators of next year in great positioning for ongoing growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael and good afternoon, everyone. Given the unique situation in 2020 and 2021, Q1 of 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our operations and key performance indicators. So while I will provide some commentary around our results relative to Q1 of 2021, most of our focus will be relative to 2019. Overall, our AOI of $209 million for the quarter was $361 million better than 2021, led by an improvement of $269 million in ticketing, $66 million in sponsorship and $26 million in concerts. This was our highest Q1 AOI ever exceeding Q1 of 2019 by $94 million, which had been our previous record first quarter. Let me give a bit more color on each division. Then I will give you more on 2022 leading indicators. First ticketing was again the star of the quarter delivering $206 million in AOI, making it the second best quarter ever for ticketing and more than doubling the Q1 2019 AOI results of a $100 million. The first quarter of 2021 was heavily impacted by the pandemic resulting in an AOI loss of $63 million. Ticketing was successful across the board. Let me give a few key statistics for the quarter. Our growth came from both primary and secondary ticketing with transacted GTV, excluding refunds up 33% and 106% respectively. Transacted ticket volume, excluding refunds were 63 million tickets, our fourth highest quarter ever, and 7 million tickets higher than Q1 of 2019. Transacted ticketing GTV excluding refunds was $6.3 billion, our second highest quarter ever after Q4 of 2021 and 39% higher than Q1 2019. This was driven by concerts and sporting events whose GTV were up 49% and 73% respectively relative to Q1 2019. A continued shift toward more market-based pricing help grow our GTV levels with average primary ticket prices up double-digits for the first quarter, relative to Q1 2019. And in resale, our average price increased 18% while our overall resale GTV doubled compared to the first quarter of 2019, indicating that demand for the top seats across all live events continues to outpace efforts by sports teams, artists, and others, to capture more of the full value from their events. As the first effectively normal Q1 since 2019, we are seeing that digital tickets have now become the norm across live events with the NFL and NBA leading the way with 96% of fans using digital tickets to enter games up from 53% in Q1 of 2019. More broadly, 72% of our tickets globally were digital in Q1 of 2022, relative to 33% in Q1 2019. With this level of digital adoption, we can now accelerate our efforts to foster our direct fan relationships this year and into 2023. Next, sponsorship continued to ramp up with the reopening of Venues and expanded online opportunities. As a result, 2022 Q1 sponsorship and advertising AOI of $70 million grew by 75% relative to 2019 Q1 AOI of $40 million. This strength comes across both onsite and online each delivering record Q1 AOI. The growth versus 2019 was driven by expansion of our online business, new festivals that launched in the quarter and the addition of O's brand partners. Finally, in concerts, our AOI was a loss of $49 million, which compares to a loss of $74 million in Q1 of 2021 and positive AOI of $5 million in Q1 of 2019. As we indicated on the last call, we planned for fewer arena tours in Q1 this year, which typically drives our first quarter performance, resulting in concert seasonality that will be even more Q2 and Q3 driven this year than has historically been the case. In the quarter, we had nearly 11 million fans attend 6,600 events continuing to be led by the US and the UK, which accounted for almost 80% of these fans. In comparison, Q1 of 2019 had 15 million fans and 8,200 shows when all of our markets and all venue types were fully open. For ticket sales through late April for shows playing off this year, our average ticket price was up double digits relative to the first quarter of 2019, again mainly driven by demand for the best seats. At the same time, our average entry price remains less than $35 overall and less than $30 for amphitheatre and club shows. Michael mentioned that no-how rates were back to pre-COVID levels. So I wanted to give a few more specifics to hopefully set the record straight. Looking at the full year through mid-April for the US, our no-show rates were the same or better than the same period for 2019. For arenas, they were 1% better for amphitheatres, they were 4% better, for theaters and clubs, they were on par and all up, we are 2% better. We haven't had enough volume on other outdoor events to have meaningful metrics yet, but generally those Venues had strong re-openings last summer and so we don't expect any issues there and used there. In general, the US was ahead of the rest of the world, but the UK is now fully backed to pre-pandemic, no-show rates as well and we have not seen any evidence in any markets of any long-term impact on our shows. Michael gave you the top line on our first quarter average revenue per fan growth up 30% for both theaters and clubs and festivals. For theaters and clubs, key drivers include onsite concessions and upsells and for festivals, the growth was heavily driven by onsite concessions and increased VIP purchases. All indicators have continued strong fans spending as they look to make the most of going to the show. Finally, COVID continues to have less and less impact on our concert schedule and by March in the US, we cancelled only around 1% of our planned concerts. As we look to the remainder of 2022, looking at our leading indicators through the end of April 1, confirmed show bookings are up over 40% overall and up double-digits for each amphitheatres, arenas, stadiums and festivals. Second, ticketing has sold 130 million fee bearing tickets for events this year up 26% from this point in 2019, of these, 88 million tickets over concert events, which is 40% higher than 2019. Related to this, we have $3.5 billion in event-related deferred revenue, almost twice the level of Q1 2019. These are largely tickets that have been sold by Ticketmaster for Live Nation concerts, but the revenue in AOI hasn't flowed through yet and will do so over the course of this year, as events happen. On the sponsorship side, commitments are up double-digits from this point in 2019 and overall we have more than 90% of our plan sponsorship net revenue for 2022 set. On the cost side, we're obviously tracking closely cost increases associated both with labor and in general, with supply chain challenges and inflation. These costs tend to hit us primarily in the Venues we operate; amphitheatres, theaters and clubs and festivals. For amphitheatres and theaters and clubs, labor is the largest factor given we have our Venues in place. Across this entire fan base, we expect our variable cost per fan, excluding talent to increase by $2 to $2.50 relative to 2019. This remains well below our average revenue per fan growth and so we still expect to grow average per fan profitability across our operated Venues this year. Festivals have a broader range of costs given the wider set of equipment and services involved in building these events. Current projections are that variable costs per fan excluding talent will be up 7% this year, which is well below our expected increase in ticket revenue per fan. Helping offset all these costs is the $200 million cost reduction exercise that we executed last year, which remains well in place. A few other points on 2022, we now expect OCESA will deliver full year results in line with 2019 levels as Mexico is fully active with most of their AOI flowing through our sponsorship and ticketing divisions. In light of the OCESA acquisition, we wanna provide more guidance on a few mine items below AOI, which impact our earnings per share calculation. First on depreciation and amortization, we expect the combination of these accounts to be roughly in line with 2019. The addition of OCESA is offset by the impacts of our reduced investment in CapEx and M&A over the past two years. With the acquisition of OCESA and anticipated strong performance of our festivals, many of which are joined ventures, we expect non-controlling interest expense will be roughly double 2019 levels. We are projecting increasing to be about $150 million this year. Again, the increase compared to 2019 is largely attributable to the OCESA acquisition. As a result of the additional financing opportunities over the past two years, our interest expense is now roughly $70 million per quarter. Finally, in comparison to 2019, we expect income tax expense will grow in line with our AOI growth. In anticipation and the growth opportunities ahead of us this year, we continue to expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million with two thirds of this spent on revenue generating projects. We generated $89 million of adjusted free cash flow this quarter and expect free cash flow conversion from AOI to be back in the fifties for the full year. We ended Q1 with $1.9 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to invest in growth. We are comfortable with our leverage with over 85% of our debt at a fixed rate and our average cost of debt is roughly 4.3% positioning as well in this interest rate environment. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? Operator :  Your first question comes from line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. David Karnovsky : All right. Thank you. Michael, you've given a lot of great leading indicators for '22. So I apologize to jump ahead, but you did mention in the release 60 tours and discussion for '23 and was hoping you could put some context around that. How elevated would that number be, kind of relative to what you might normally be looking at this early on and is there a way to kind of think through how much of that is sort of backlog continue to work through from the pandemic versus sort of just you organically increasing your footprint? Michael Rapino : Yeah, thank you. The '23 is really no backlog. '22 is the year where we would've flushed out any reschedule tours from 2019 '21, wherever. So 2023 is kind of if you want to call almost back to business and yes, it's a very vibrant pipe. I think we said at the Investor Date, if you want to kind of scale back and look at the next five years, you can kind of look at what we did going into '19, where we looked at the industry growing at almost 10% a year on a compounded basis. We think the industry is going to be doing that again. It's back to full growth, high quality growth sector industry and we think we tend to outperform the industry. So we look at '23 will be a, if you want to call it a record year coming off of '22, and we think we're in for multiple record years of growth. David Karnovsky : Okay. Grant, and then just on Ticketmaster, I was wondering if you could just walk through some of the drivers of the strong secondary growth you're seeing in particular, you mentioned share gains, whereas in the past, I think we tended to think of market shares for you and your competitors as generally stable. Maybe you could just speak to some of the initiatives, you taking it to league or team level to kind of drive that higher. And then just as a follow on, is there any update you can provide on the NFL relationship just given that's now extended to 2026. Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Hey David, this is Joe I'll take it. And I think the questions are related. Start with the NFL. We entered the partnership with the NFL four years ago, I guess, and that relationship was really technology driven and it was a mutual strategy of figuring out how do we shift the industry to digital ticketing? How do we understand identity-enabled relationships with the fans, for the leagues, for the teams as well as for Ticketmaster and that's proven to be very successful and obviously coming out of COVID not surprisingly, the NFL said, what's the next technology agenda. We worked with them on deploying NFTs and they said, this is all great, better to talk now about linking back up for the next five years. So we know we can work together and figure out what's the next technology unlocked. How do we continue to use technology is really it's the core of the relationship or the starting point of the relationship with the fans. So that's what led to the renewal. We're excited about it. We think the NFL's been a great partner and we'll continue to be. So naturally as you do that, we continue at Ticketmaster to get smarter and smarter about the fan as well. That lets us continue to use our alignment and our mutual interest with the teams and the league in terms of driving Ticketmaster share in the secondary. So we're taking all the data we have, all the information we're working with them on all of their assets to help acquire customers, to use all the season ticket holder inventory, to continue to drive our share and provide a great marketplace, a great experience for fans to be buying those tickets. So combination of all of those has led to increasing share which is as Michael talked about part of how we've doubled secondary in the first quarter relative to 2019. David Karnovsky : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Laszczyk - Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Laszczyk : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to start, I think there's been a fair amount of concern on the macro front. You touched on a little bit at the end of your prepared remarks, but I was curious if you're seeing any signs of consumers changing their spending habits, whether that's on the initial ticket purchase or once they get to the venue against what's turning out to be a pretty difficult inflationary environment. Any data points from the last few weeks I think would be helpful there. Joe Berchtold : Yeah, I think this is Joe. I think all of the data points that we're seeing continue to be very strong. Look at our concert ticket sales as we look in March and April, each of those months the ticket sales were up 20% plus relative to 2019. So through March and April, I think we've seen some of these pressures, the gas and so on for a few months now. So not just a few weeks, so we've seen no impact at all on the concert ticket sales. We talked about the pricing, seeing no impact on the take rate of those tickets and the onsite spending the EFs again seeing those up substantially relative to 2019. So no impact there. So from all the different angles that we've looked at it, we have not seen any pullback in consumer behavior. I think that this continues to be part of people want to get out, have a social life, to spend on experiences taking money away from spending on goods. And a lot of what we do is we spoke to the $35 overall average entry price for a ticket or $30 for clubs and amphitheatre. It continues to be a very affordable night out for those that need to be most conscious of that. Stephen Laszczyk : Thanks. That's helpful. And then I think in the pressure release, you mentioned some opportunity to create new ad units on the sponsorship side, both on site and online. I was wondering if you talk a little bit more about this opportunity and the new inventory, how much of it you expect to create over time and whether that might help bring in new ad categories? Joe Berchtold : Well, it is creating new ad categories, right? We talked about that in the technology space, in the FinTech space, throughout the whole purchase path integration, all of that is creating new categories and that's, what's driving even this year a lot of the growth in the sponsorship business. Michael talked very explicitly about what you're seeing on site. Two great examples of how technology's being used to enhance the live experience with Verizon, putting in the infrastructure with the 5G connectivity and with snap as a great product development, product design organization, coming up with some ways to use their products and augmented reality to enhance the onsite experience. So really on the onsite piece, this is all about how do you make a better and better fan experience? And we've got great brands, partners that we work with that are looking to do more and more to make that possible and then as we continue to work on the Ticketmaster marketplace, tie that in with the increased data that we have from the digital ticketing that we were just talking about, how do we create more tailored ad units and make more opportunities for more sponsors to connect with those fans as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Ross : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to build the macro concerns that the last analyst kind of laid out and insofar as inflation and gas prices are concerned, I think the results speak for themselves, but investor pushback has now moved to the possibility of recession and how that would affect you given how deeply consumer discretionary you are. How do you think about your positioning at this point, if a recession scenario played out? Your company and the industry looks very different than it did in 2010 when we lost less of that kind of macro pressure, can you kind of compare and contrast and I know you were booking those acts for next year, kind of far in advance, how much flexibility is there in those contracts? Joe Berchtold : Sure. Brandon, This is Joe. Oh, go ahead. Michael Rapino : I was -- I'll start and then Joe and jump in. What we always think is one of the great advantages of our business is the pricing is variable, right? So there is no set cost of good. The cost of good is determined by the artist if they go on the road and they're variable. So that makes our product something that can move around on pricing, whether it's taking advantage of the front row pricing, that's under-priced or moving the total ticket price down in the back end of the house or reducing the overall price of the ticket to meet the market and the demand. So historically this is an industry that's been fairly recession proof. It's still, as we've seen, this is still one of the top three entertainment choices for consumer, but the most affordable. So you may not in a recession take that trip. You may not have a large out a purchase of a dishwasher, but you will still go down to amphitheatre or the club or the theater and have a great adventure and a night out for the value. So we have always seen historically over time, the consumer still looks at the concert as a high value item that even during the recession, if there was a pullback, this is something they still can afford to do. And it's actually a great alternative to a higher priced, maybe travel package. So one, we think it is a -- still a much a very affordable option for consumers and pricing will continue to be something that we can adjust. If we see any pullback, artists will always have one motive the same as ours, fill the house, get everyone in the house. So right up until the hour of the show, we always look at variable and dynamic pricing options to say, how do we get the house full. Joe? Joe Berchtold : Yeah. And just to build on that first is we now have a level of information that is very -- we didn't have even 10 years ago and almost no industry has called the secondary market. So to Michael's point on pricing flexibility, we have the benefit of knowing real time, what is market pricing and so on one level, you can think that billion dollars plus of price arbitrage that exists on our tickets, that's the first wall of defense in any recessionary environment that pricing comes out first before our pricing's even impacted. And we have a great read on what is the supply that dynamic to be adjusting as we go along. And then along with that, again, you have, again, the macros of the shift of spend from experience -- from goods to experiences, which is continuing. You have the wealth built up and the biggest gains in terms of the income with a lower quartile. So you've got good revenue there. Still, you've got affordable entry prices that we've talked about on the tickets. So we continue to think that as long as we stay focused on what is the value perceived by the fan, stay aligned with that. We'll be able to bring the acts out and sell the tickets. Brandon Ross : Great. And then for the first time that I can remember, at least you called out the per caps at theatres, clubs and festivals, it's not something you usually talk about. That's usually the amphitheatre opportunity. Can you kind of help us understand where you stand relative to the amphitheatre opportunity on per caps at those other owned and operated venue types and how much upside there could be for investors in that area? Joe Berchtold : Yeah, we called out the theatres and clubs in the festivals this quarter because we knew that all you guys were going to want some data on what's going on with the fans on site. It being the first quarter, we don't really have amphitheatre data yet. So we were trying to use what data we could have on our other buildings, the theatres and clubs and festivals and then also to tie that back to any questions on costs. So that was the purpose of doing that was to give everybody comfort that we had still a very strong onsite consumer behavior. We don't have the date on amputates yet for the summer, but again, taking that as the leading indicator, we feel good about it. And we think there's a long runway. We talked in February about how we still think that there's 30%, 40%, 50% increase in our onsite spend, as we do a better job on some of the VIP and premium offers and do a better job of how it is we're marketing and selling upsell opportunities on site. Brandon Ross : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Glagola : Yes. Thanks for the question. Joe, on Latin America expansion, can we just unpack sort of the assessor guidance of delivering full year results in line with 2019 a bit more? I have, for my calculation, it's about like $500 million in revenue and $85 million in EBITDA. Is that correct? Is that sort of the baseline, and then typically you guys have been able to organically grow on your M&A 70%, 80% plus in the first couple years after consolidating that asset. Is that a similar type of growth that we should expect as analysts in our model? Joe Berchtold : So I guess, let me break into a couple of pieces there. So this year we expect both Mexico and Latin America broadly to do well. I think that it would be a very strong Latin America year relative to '19, even without OCESA, having OCESA only makes it all that much stronger. Your numbers aren't terribly far off. You have to kind of triangulate. They're within the general ballpark of what our numbers would be for '19 and therefore for '22. I don't think we're ready to start declaring the specifics of what OCESA is going to be in '23 or '24 yet. Give us a little time to get there with them and we'll keep you updated on it. But we do see Mexico and Latin America more broadly, certainly as one of our great growth drivers over the next few years. Stephen Glagola : Okay. And then thanks for that. Michael Rapino : Both concerts -- both concerts and Ticketmaster, just to remind you, it's a huge upside in Mexico and ticketing and that we, we're only a 30% owner to Mexico. And now that we own it, we've already had the team down there. We're upgrading, they're still living on a green screen with not much feature functionality. So big upside secondary, etcetera, to add in Mexico and throughout Europe. So big growth opportunity, both in concerts and sponsorship and ticketing. Stephen Glagola : Okay. Thanks Michael. And just one more on modeling questions for the rest of this year and guidance, you have these two, obviously the big Rock and Rio festival scheduled this year that had a outsize impact. I believe on the sponsorship segment in 2019. Just, how should we be thinking about that impact on the P&L this year? And then also, this is the fourth consecutive quarter now with ticketing AOI margins above 40%. Is this -- I believe this is probably just driven because most of the business in the US and UK right now, but is that something, we can expect throughout the remainder of the year, or do you expect that to moderate closer to the mid-thirties as the year progresses? Joe Berchtold : In terms of Rock and Rio, I think we've got that again this year. So I think it would be consistent with '19 in that regard and in terms of Ticketmaster you're right. It's continuing to do great. The margins are flowing through it is benefiting from the US waiting if you will right now, but with the cost taken out, we think it, this year probably be a high thirties margin when all is said and done, and you get some rebalancing with some of the international, which is a lower margin business. Stephen Glagola : All right, appreciate it. Thank you, Joe. Thanks, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. David Katz : Hi afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. There was some earlier discussion around broad-based consumer trends, but I recall your investor event, there was a fair amount of talk about utilizing the premium end of pricing and platinum and other kinds of high end. Can you maybe unpack the price ranges on things and Joe, I know some of your comments were addressed more toward the average or even the value customer. Are you seeing any change at all, positive or negative at the high end? Joe Berchtold : No, absolutely. The over the overall double-digit increase is driven by the high end across our major stadiums arenas. Amphitheatres, I think we've probably about doubled the number of tickets to go into what we call the platinum or market based pricing. So more than anything else is probably more of the tickets are getting market priced or closer to market priced, and then depending on the artist than the show, yes, it's also flexing upward from where it would've been historically, as we try to get closer to the true market price. Even as doing this, you can tell by our commentary about the size, growth of the secondary we've helped move $500 million to the artist this year, but I think the secondary has grown more on our tickets. So it's not that we're out there capturing every penny even while getting these increases this year, but we're continuing to try to move in that direction. David Katz : Understood. And if I may follow up in a different direction it's the first time probably in 2.5 years that we would even raise it. But how are you thinking about leverage and cap structure and how much cash versus how much debt. Is that, I see a pattern going back a number of years, but any change in how you might think about that going forward? Joe Berchtold : Well, I think one of the things that gives us a lot of comfort is that over 85% of our debt is fixed rate. So we're sitting at 4.3% in a pretty fixed debt structure with short-term increases having a fairly limited impact on us. So I think we're feeling fine about our about our total debt level. Our total coverage based on our AOI, I think continues to be very robust and we don't have any concerns about being able to grow in from an AOI standpoint and into our debt. David Katz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Benjamin Swinburne : Thanks. Good afternoon. I have two questions. First, just on -- back on Ticketmaster, I think you guys talked about or had in the release 7 million new tickets one in the quarter, 14 last year. It's really strong in terms of adding new business. Can you talk a little bit about, any context to what kind of business you're adding, US versus international, venue type and what's driving that and whether you're seeing any increased competitive behaviour. We sort of hear about competition on the primary side, including on price, but it doesn't seem like it's affecting Ticketmaster share gains at all. So just be interested in some more color around the success there and whether this taste can keep up. Joe Berchtold : Yeah. I think the 7 million story is the same as the 17 million story. When you're at this scale, it's everything. International has been very strong, which has been driven by the dramatic improvements in the international product that we've had as we move to a single integrated platform. And that has further differentiated us, particularly internationally, relative to where we've been. At the same time, we've had continued success in the US and many of the discussions are product driven. The confidence that working with Ticketmaster, you're only going to have the best enterprise products in the best marketplace today, but the level of investment that we're making and the scale of the dollars being spent to build new product is unparalleled in its commitment to continuing to enhance for the teams and the artists and the fans, what their experience is gonna be. You always have price pressure, you have price competition and everything. There's no new news there. That's what you always have. It's always your job as a company to figure out how do I continue to create my product so that it's differentiated so that it reduces the price. And then how do I continue to get more efficient and make money in other ways off my flywheel so that overall my aggregate economics continue to improve, nothing new there. Benjamin Swinburne : Got it. And then just on back on the macro, I know everyone's concern given some of the other earnings results we've seen in this quarter. Your sponsorship business, Joe, I think it's largely sort of longer term contracts. I think you might have some, kind of display advertising in there. We've heard some of the big digital ad players that businesses have softened here in the second quarter. Can you just remind us how long duration that business is for you guys and if you're seeing any signs of softening in any part of your sponsorship business has given what we've heard from other companies. Thank you. Joe Berchtold : We're not seeing any signs of softening. Michael gave you some of the numbers on these -- on the large relationships that we have, the million dollar plus relationships that have been our focus on growing the number of those relationships, the breadth of assets that we provide to them, and just how much of our sponsorship base they represent. So they're coming at it from multiyear, multi-asset saying we want to be present at the festival at the amphitheatre. We also are going to have an online presence. It's a much higher level of integration than just a simple ad by with some of the other players out there. So we're not seeing that impact at all. Michael Rapino : And, Ben, just to jump in also on, I know you had brought it up also, our no-show rates I know that's always been some rumour go out there, but as we stated in our release, we're seeing no challenges at all. People are showing up to the shows. We are showing similar to 2018, '19, your regular low digit no-show rate of people that don't make it to the show. But back to normal, people come and drum to those shows no issues at all in terms of showing up. Benjamin Swinburne : Yep. I saw that you, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Sundby : Hey guys. Thanks for the question. You mentioned 20 new Venues in the pipeline and 38 new festivals, I guess, starting on the, the festival side is something coming from OCESA. How many of these are, or maybe first time and were you able to pick up a, a large number here of festivals that struggle during COVID and then on the venue side, how should we think about the, the timing of those opening up and maybe the size in terms of overall staying capacity that could add. Michael Rapino : On the festival side, we, we have a, a few great festival companies in Europe and America. And part of the success of live nation has been about organic growth, continuing to grow the business finding you know, new market shares, new global entry points and festivals being a big part of regenerating our business. So we're always looking to add every year and let our festival companies launch new ideas. And this year we've had some great success. One of our young companies, C3, it's been in business with a strong festival promoter, Jeff Shoeman. We launched a, when we were, when we were young festival out of Vegas, we hoped to sell 40,000 tickets. We sold over 160,000 tickets in Vegas; so huge success in a brand new festival. So we love those stories. We encourage all of our festival entrepreneurs to take swings every year. We usually have a 50% success rate. Some of those go on to be great brands. Some you fail fast to move on. So 38 was a indicator. I'll let you know, we have a large, a hundred plus portfolio of festivals around the world, like amphitheater and Venues. There are high margin business because of sponsorship, food, and beverage. And not only do we look to acquire and bolt on when we can, but we are a big machine of organically creating new festivals that the majority of our growth and this year we're back to full speed on letting our entrepreneurs go swing and create some new revenue for us. Ryan Sundby : Great. How about here Venues? Michael Rapino : Joe? Joe can jump in. It's a similar story. We're just starting, continuing, I mean, Venues would be one that we didn't really slow-down during COVID because they have a longer lead time. So if you, you look at our venue nation division that we highlighted in the investor day and kind of our continued focus around our 300 plus Venues that we operate around the world. I think we said we have probably 75 in the pipe and we annually open up probably about 20 new festivals around the world. So we're on plan, continuing to move on that aggressive front to continue expand on a global basis club theatre and a theatre. We just opened a beautiful arena in Austin last week to record sales, record results proud of that one and more to come. So continued opening and phasing throughout the years we've been doing historically. Ryan Sundby : Great. And then it sounded like 72% of tickets were, were digital and Q1 versus 33% in, '19. I know most of the attendance this quarter though came from the U.S. and the UK, which I assume led the, the digital rollout. So I guess how should we think about digital penetration moving forward? And I maybe, can you talk a little bigger picture if you, if you're starting to act on, on that data that you're collecting? Joe Berchtold : Yeah, I you're right. It's helped a little bit. I still think we end the year probably around 80% globally. A lot of this has to do with not just the infrastructure on our end, but rolling out the access control new systems that have to get deployed for each of these Venues and doing that on a global basis, just with some of the supply chain in terms of getting those pieces in place. It'll take a little bit of time, but we're making great progress and we're already acting on the data. Just saw some of the information yesterday, looking at how we're using it for more effectively targeting the marketing. So when you, your email from live nation on what concerts, it's much more tailored to you than it was in 2019 as a result, the click through rates and the buy rates are up substantially. And then as we get into the summer, and we have people going to our operated amphitheater as our operated festivals, we expect that we'll be able to use that digital connection to more effectively market upsell connect sponsors with fans. So we'll see all of that activity beginning in much more earnest in the in this year. Joe Berchtold : Great. Hear, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Hargan with Benchmark. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Hargan : Thank you. Two conceptual questions, firstly the end  it feels like it's a nice digital memorabilia compliment in experience versus something that someone buys it at Sotheby's and it's right in your wheelhouse. You know, what innovation are you seeing with the NBA this season in the NFL? And there's a way to really personalize it even more and have more variety? And then secondly, at your investor today, you talked a lot about hyper slicing nomenclature sounds very Elon Musk, does that also have some affectability to Mexico with ESSA and even some of the European markets? I know you talked about that really keeping the U.S. around 40% of the TA, but some of those other larger markets, it seemed like you could apply that concept of local act acts over a period of time? Thank you. Michael Rapino : Yeah. On the NFT, I think I think we're deep into discussions and product development and testing. Like all of the leagues are doing, we have a, a dual a lens. If you want to call it on Ticketmaster side, we are working in hand in tandem with the NFL and NBA on minting, all of the tickets. We did all the super bowl tickets through Ticketmaster that were NFT souvenirs. We're doing it for the teams. We've been working with mark Cuban and others. So on the Ticketmaster side, we're getting to see all of the best versions of what some sports teams and brands are doing with NFTs. On the concert side, we've worked on our artist management division with our artists and seen some of the versions that they're looking at, whether it's in the metaverse, whether it's a fortnight or whether it's a song on an NFT. So we're looking and learning on that side and on the live nation side the NFC is really just an extension of what someone mentioned earlier, the digital ticket. I mean, the, the most important thing for us overall is to have identity tied to the ticket. So, so moving from a PDF ticket where we knew nobody, it had no contract, it had no rights, it had no carry on value, moving to a block-chain, digital NFT ticket in general that just opens up the doors to first having identity tied to the ticket. So we can have a better conversation with you. And we think NFT to that ticket, we can create a community of value and look at and ways to add value to you on an ongoing basis if you've opened up and been part of the live ticket stub NFT today. So we're we think it's great opportunity to add more value to the relationship with that purchaser. And we're going to, we're going to keep experiment ideas on that front. The second question, I, I didn't quite even I didn't hear it well enough. Yeah. Joe and jump in on you. Joe Berchtold : I'm Sorry. On the hyperly thing. No, I got it. I got it. Yeah. So on the hyper local strategy that we've been talking about absolutely applies in throughout Europe, throughout Mexico, Latin America, all of the markets in we're going into each country, we're establishing a beachhead, getting to some scale, leveraging that scale to then say, what are each of the specific markets that we can go to and expand the operation. So that's a core part. Somebody was talking earlier how we, when we make the acquisition, we grow it substantially. Well, our, our, with Germany, when we grew in, they were operating in two cities and then selling off the con the concert in all the other cities that there are 10, 12 cities in Germany where you could easily have the population to route your chore through. So that became the focus and that's how we grew that business. So we'll be following that playbook globally. It is a large part of when you look at the Tam and why the Tam is so large, it's because all of that demand exists through so many different markets, not just the ones where we're historically bringing shows to. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question. Barton Crockett : Okay, great. Thank you for taking the question. You know, I wanted to ask a little bit about this 60 tour marker booked already for 2023, which is you know, sounds compelling, but, but it'd be great to have a little bit more context. And I was wondering if this might kind of get at it. Can you give us a sense of at this time of 2019, how many tours, if any, did you have already booked for 2021? That might be one way to look at it. And secondarily if you've got 60 tours already booked for 2023, how many do you have booked right now for 2022? Michael Rapino : I, I think I can give you generalities to make you feel good that '23 going to look good. I mean, that's obviously what you're, you're trying to get at. So I think in, if you look at '20 to your point of how many did we have booked, or how many would we be reviewing for, for, for a historic year at this time period, we would, we would be about double where, where a historic marker would be if you want to use that as a, as a basic line. So, 60 would be a, a fabulous number to be talking about this time of year for a, for a next year activity. So that's, that kind of gives you a kind of a robust feeling of what's what '23 will look to be. Barton Crockett : Okay. And switch gears a little bit on the recession question. You know, back in the, the last kind of the great recession. Oh, 8 or 9 or 10 were concerts in your experience at live nation, more, a lagging indicator or a leading indicator, I would guess lagging. And so if there is a recession impact, you might be the last to feel it, but I was wondering if you had any thoughts about that? Joe Berchtold : Yeah, it was a lagging indicator. It didn't hit till 2010. We had it for one summer. And I think we had a lot less data on the market then, than we have now, I talked about the secondary market and how that provides such great transparency today into the specific supply demand dynamics, the pricing, not just in the front of the house, but through the whole building. We didn't have that back then. So we were making a lot of decisions, a lot more blindly. So we have better information. We're set up to be much more nimble in terms of how we respond to that information. And again, that was the one year out of not just the last recession, but if you look over the past 30 years at a handful of different recessions, it was the one year when there was any Operator : Decline in our business. Barton Crockett : Okay. That's great. Thank you, Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session, and I'd like to turn a call back to Mr. Joe behold and Michael Rapino for closing remarks. Michael Rapino : All right, everybody. Thank you. Have a great summer. We'll talk soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. The second quarter confirmed that live entertainment industry is back globally and bigger than ever. Live Nation led this return and continues to deliver the best global network to support artists as they play shows for the fans around the world. Every key operating metric is at an all-time high as we promoted more concerts, had more fans attend shows, they spent more money, sold more tickets and enable brands to connect with fans at a scale we have never seen before. As a result, relative to 2019, with over a 40% increase in revenue to $4.4 billion and a 50% increase in AOI to $480 million. With most of the world fully reopened, it's clear that concerts remain a high priority for fans. Consumers are seeking out and spending more on experiences. And the growing demand for live music and events is driving our business to record levels, far outpacing any macro issues or cost increases. Momentum across our business has remained strong in recent months and weeks, and demand combined with the substantial concert pipeline gives us confidence in our ongoing growth this year and into 2023. During the second quarter, we promoted over 12,000 concerts for 33.5 million fans, each up over 20% relative to the second quarter of 2019. Of the over 6 million additional fans this quarter, 5 million of that growth came from international markets, driven by the addition of OCESA and the reopening of most global markets with particularly strong focus and demand through Europe and Latin America. Growth was broad-based with double-digit attendance increased at venues of all types, demonstrating strong demand for events at all sizes from large-scale stadiums and festivals, sentiment clubs and theaters. Even as show count and attendance grew, fans demonstrated their willingness to pay more for the best seats with the average price of a ticket for our concerts this year up 10% globally relative to 2019, which remains less in the U.S. inflation level over the period. At the same time, our average entry price for concerts remain affordable at $33, up only 5% from 2019. With market-based pricing being widely adopted by most tours, we expect to shift over 500 million from the secondary market to artists this year, continuing to support those who created the concert and ensuring they are benefiting from it. On the venue side of our concert business, we continue to build our portfolio of operated venues with an active pipeline of almost 30 new venues across the globe. We are seeing the benefit of operating more venues as a number of fans who attended shows in our owned and operated venues during the quarter was up 13% to over 14 million fans, and we expect that figure to reach over 50 million fans for the full year. And fans are spending more on site with average per fan revenue up 20% at each of our amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs relative to 2019, with the average per fan revenue at our amphitheaters this year at $38.50, up 30% relative to 2019. Our ticket business also demonstrated strong growth in the quarter, transacted fee-bearing ticket volume up 48% to 77 million tickets and transacted GTV up 76% to $7.3 billion, both relative to 2019. This is our highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, with April, May and June, accounting for three of our top five all-time fee-bearing months. 75% of this growth came from concerts, another indicator of the high demand for live music. Along with the volume increase, transacted ticket prices globally was up approximately 15% for the first half of the year relative to 2019 as both concerts and sporting events saw similar low double-digit price increases during the period. Even with strong primary ticketing sales and increased pricing, demand for live events on our secondary ticketing marketplace remain high. And as a result, our GTV more than doubled for the quarter relative to 2019. We are continuing to see the benefits of our technology investments at Ticketmaster, including our global leadership in digital ticketing between new capabilities and the sales effectiveness of our ticketing marketplace, we consistently deliver high ticket sales for our event organizers. As a result, we continue to win business from new and existing clients. And to the first half of this year, we had a 12.8 million net new fee-bearing tickets to our marketplace, led again this year by our international markets, which accounted for 60% of this new growth. Sponsorship has also benefited from the concert flywheel this quarter, driving 74% growth in revenue relative to 2019. As we further enabled more brands to connect with an increasing number of fans on a global basis, festival sponsorship has performed particularly well during the first half of the year, more than doubling from 2019, led by nine new festivals in our Mexico and Latin American businesses that accounted for roughly half this increase, along with broad growth in sponsorship levels across most of the North American festivals. And we continue adding more clients in technology, telecom and purchase path integration, including Google, AWS and Hulu, with these categories collectively more than doubling this sponsorship since 2019. As we look forward to the second half of 2022 and into 2023, we have sold over 100 million tickets for our concerts this year, more than we sold for the entire year 2019. Fan demand remained strong and continued growth in ticket buying and on-site spending. And given the long-term nature of most of our sponsorship partnerships, our planned sponsorship for the year is now fully committed. As we prepare for 2023, everywhere globally is open for concerts. And we are actively rooting all of our markets with the largest artist pipeline we have ever seen at this point of the year. And for the 2023 tours we have put on sale so far, all signs continue pointing to strong fan demand. With that, I will let Joe take you through more details of our results. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As with last quarter, 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our operations and key performance indicators, so most of our focus will be relative to Q2 of 2019. For the Company, our reported revenue of $4.4 billion for the quarter was $1.3 billion better than Q2 2019 or an increase of 40%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $4.6 billion for the quarter, so there was roughly a 4% impact due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In our reported AOI of $480 million for the quarter was $160 million better than 2019, up 50% and led by an improvement of over $100 million in ticketing and $80 million in sponsorship. On a constant currency basis, our Q2 AOI was $502 million. The FX impact of negative $23 million or 4% was largely driven by the devaluation of the euro and the pound. This was not only our highest Q2 AOI ever but it was also our highest quarterly AOI ever, beating our prior record quarter, which was Q3 of 2019 by 12%. Notable given that Q3 is traditionally our highest AOI quarter each year, and we converted almost 80% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $379 million. Let me give a bit more color on each division, and then I'll give you more on full year leading indicators. First, in concerts, our AOI was $123 million for the quarter, which compares to $133 million in Q2 of 2019. It was one of concert's strongest second quarters ever despite limited activity in our Asia Pacific region and operating cost increases. Additionally, while OCESA had a very strong return to activity, its AOI largely flows through sponsorship and ticketing while their concerts division absorbs most of its costs. In the quarter, we had over 33 million fans attend 12,500 events, growing nearly 25% compared to Q2 of 2019 when we had 27 million fans attend 10,000 shows. And we continue to see growth in our on-site spend with no signs of change. Here's what we're seeing so far this year by venue type across our owned or operated buildings. In our amphitheaters, ancillary per fan revenue has risen to $38.5, an increase of $9 per fan over 2019 levels or 30% growth. At our theaters and clubs in the U.S., ancillary per fan revenue has increased by over 25%, driven by higher concession sales and increased purchases of premium packages, fast lane entry and night of show upsells. In our theaters and clubs in the U.K., ancillary per fan revenue has risen by 20% compared to 2019, largely as a result of increased food and beverage consumption, pricing optimization as well as the shift to cashless payment. Finally, at our major festivals, increased spending on concessions, campaign and VIP experiences has driven ancillary per fan revenue up by over 30%. The consistent theme here is that as we continue elevating our hospitality operations and create more premium options, fans are eager to enhance their experience. At this point, we still have a lot more room to grow these higher-quality experience offerings throughout our owned or operated portfolio, which includes over 400 venues and festivals globally at this point. Next, ticketing had another very successful quarter, delivering $231 million of AOI, making it the most profitable quarter ever for ticketing, beating the record set just last year in the fourth quarter and nearly doubling the Q2 2019 AOI results of $124 million. Our growth came from both primary and secondary ticketing with transacted ticketing GTV up 69% and 141%, respectively. Transacted ticket volume, excluding refunds, was 77 million tickets, our highest quarter ever, besting our former record of 65 million tickets in Q4 2021 by 18% and 25 million tickets or 48% higher than Q2 of 2019. Transacted ticketing GTV, excluding refunds, was $7.3 billion, our highest quarter ever, besting our former record of $6.6 billion of Q4 of 2021 by 11% and $3.1 billion and 76% higher than Q2 of 2019. International markets are now largely back and contributing to this growth with transacted ticketing GTV up 67% relative to Q2 2019. As Michael mentioned, approximately 75% of our growth came from concerts, which was due to both higher fan attendance at our concerts and also timing with a number of on sales expected to happen in Q3 getting moved up into Q2. Even as more of the ticket value is captured for content organizers, our secondary marketplaces continue to grow rapidly with four of our five best resale days ever in Q2 and 12 of our top 20 resale days in 2022. We continue to believe that the secondary market is a leading indicator for primary pricing opportunities over the next few years as well as a buffer against any demand fluctuations. Finally, sponsorship had its biggest quarter ever with AOI of $178 million, 80% higher than our Q2 2019 AOI of $98 million. With the U.S., the U.K. and now Mainland Europe all fully opened, we had high growth in both on-site and online sponsorship with each delivering record Q2 AOI. The growth in our large multiyear multi-asset sponsor speaks to our value of connecting live music fans with global brands. We are nearing in on 100 such major sponsors that, in total, generate well over $0.5 billion in revenue and represents nearly 75% of our growth relative to 2019. As we look to the remainder of 2022, starting with our leading indicators through late July, all relative to 2019. First, confirmed show bookings are up over 30%, driven by double-digit increases in every market and across all venue types. Our concert ticket sales through the end of July are over 100 million tickets for events this year, up 38% and higher than our full year 2019 fan count. As a result, we expect a very strong Q3 for concerts with more shows and higher attendance, including fan growth at our owned or operated venues where we are continuing to see strong APF increases. Also, similar to last year, we are extending the amphitheater later in the year, adding over 1 million fans in Q4 this year relative to 2019. Michael also gave the numbers around much of our Q2 fan growth being driven by international markets, which is a great indicator of the broadly global health of our fan base. But I don't want anyone to over extrapolate this to the U.S. market as we expect North America will drive much of our fan growth in Q3. Second, ticketing has sold 183 million primary fee-bearing tickets for events this year, up 30%. Of these, 122 million tickets are for concert events, which is 42% higher than 2019. Related to this, we have $3.2 billion in event-related deferred revenue, double our level in Q2 of 2019. These are largely tickets that have been sold by Ticketmaster for Live Nation concerts but the revenue and AOI hasn't flowed through yet, and we'll do so over the course of the next year as the events occur. We remain on course for a strong Q3 in ticketing as our deferred revenue is recognized but also impacted by the shift of some of the on sales that moved into Q2. On the sponsorship side, we expect to see continued growth driven by our strong Q3 festival lineup with some of this activity also involving on-site activation support. On the cost side, increases continue to impact us primarily in the venues we operate, amphitheaters, theaters and clubs and festivals. But in all cases, we are delivering increased profitability per fan due to increased ticket and ancillary revenue. A few other points on 2022, given our presence in the U.K. and mainland Europe, we've experienced FX headwinds. And through the end of June, our AOI has been adversely impacted by $23 million. This was almost entirely in the second quarter as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the euro and the British pound. Based on current rates, we expect our AOI to continue having a 3% to 4% hit in the second half. We provided detailed guidance on line items that impact our EPS calculation last quarter, and there's just one update that I wanted to make here, which is, as noted, we expect the headwinds with FX rates to continue through the remainder of the year, which at current forward rates result in approximately $15 million quarterly below-the-line expense due to currency exchange losses on the revaluation of our foreign balance sheet balances to U.S. dollars. In anticipation of the growth opportunities ahead of us this year, we continue to expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million, with 2/3 allocated to revenue-generating projects. We expect free cash flow conversion from AOI to be back in the mid-50s for the full year. And we ended Q2 with $2.5 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity giving us sufficient flexibility to continue investing in growth. We are comfortable with our leverage with over 85% of our debt at a fixed rate and our average cost of debt of roughly 4.3%, positioning us well in this interest rate environment. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. David Karnovsky : Michael, I wanted to get your thoughts on pricing in VIP tickets. We've seen artists and VIP inventory even amid some fan pushback and negative press, which looks to me to be a break from prior years. So do you think the industry has collectively gotten to a place where artists are now kind of comfortable reclaiming the secondary market economics? And then, how much more room is there to kind of drive this process? Michael Rapino : Yes. Thank you. I think we've been saying for a few years that over time, we believe that, that secondary 10 billion, 12 billion, depending on what number you see globally has to start getting captured by the artist at some level. It's just too transparent. The more they see all of the online pricing while they work so hard to put that show on. So I do think that right artists looking at us saying, I'd like to count some of it in the front end. I don't want to be sold out at 10 01 at $200 to have someone else make $2,000. Fans not getting a deal anyway, they're spending $2,000 from somebody else. So I do think they're looking and saying, the front of the house, can we capture some demand? Now, the advantage is the, artist has one objective as we do as the venue to fill every seat. So you're never looking for the gross, you're looking to make sure that every seat is filled for the best experience. We want that. We just want that. So I do think the new dynamic pricing, the better we have become, these tools to the artists, they're looking at the holistic picture. Maybe I can charge a bit more in the front row. I got to charge less in the back row because net I'm going to sell through the back end of the house that maybe is always spot in our business. Now if you can still get the same gross, but you can lower the ticket price in the back part of the house, that's a win for everyone. So, we're right now -- Joe has the exact math. We looked at it yesterday. It's still a small percentage of the total growth is price platinum and/or dynamic, 1%, 2% kind of numbers, and really nonexistent outside of America. We just -- so yes, there's a long runway where the artists will look at the small, again, even as much always, as you heard about the Springsteen sale, than 1% of the tickets were priced a little higher to capture the second business versus 99% of the house. So to the artist, I think they'll look at us -- and then the premium, the dynamic, how do I better price my product, fill the house, lower the price on the back, capture more of the front, and we think that's got many years of runway for us to expand on a global basis. David Karnovsky : Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to ask on concerts AOI in the quarter. I think it was roughly flat versus '19, and that's with the increase in fans and the per caps. Just wondering if you could speak to the impact of things like cost inflation, mix. I know you said APAC wasn't fully open and then maybe timing as well. I think Q2 '19, if I remember correctly, had some pull forward from Q3 in that year? Joe Berchtold : This is Joe. Yes, I'll take that. I think we laid out a handful of factors that we think were some combination of timing and one-offs that impacted this quarter. Asia Pacific is not fully open yet we've got the organization up and running to prepare for being open. Just the structure of OCESA's P&L is they really drive their economics through ticketing and sponsorship whereas most of their cost structure is in the concert side. We talked about some operating cost increases for our operated venues, still driving per fan profitability increases, but you have some costs there. And then it's just -- I wouldn't over read one quarter. I gave you in mind, for instance, that a lot of this was in international markets that we had our growth, less growth in this quarter in North America. But then we have a lot of growth in Q3 in North America. As I look at the numbers overall, North America, if you look at our 100 million tickets, North America has 30% growth. So as that flows through and Q3, you'd expect to see some of that flip it around. I just don't want to read too much into it. Operator : Your next question comes from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Ross : Just wanted to drill down a little more on David's question about platinum ticketing. And I was wondering, Michael, if you could just -- because I think a lot of investors and fans are not really educated on how platinum ticketing works, can you talk about who sets the prices and kind of the cadence of ticket releases? And how you think about the -- when tickets are going to be released kind of this move from fast ticketing where everything was available at the on sale to maybe trickling out tickets more over time? And then how you think about the balance of dollars and maximizing profits for the artists with this idea of fandom and fairness and what your role in that is? Michael Rapino : All right. That's a lot. I'll try to take some pieces. We work for the artist. We're a B2B business. The artist is that decides when they tour, how they tour. Our job is to provide all the tools, platform and services to help them succeed in that tour from -- a year. Now our decision is -- they're genius brand managers. They have to balance the needs of their fans, supply demand and pricing. And some brands, like the Rolling Stones, have been very good at always saying expensive experience and we're that proud and enable to deliver that brand position. But I think artists are always trying to find a fine line on how do I make the show accessible? How do I make sure all my fans can show? How do I price it fairly versus how much money can I make? So I think they see that. I think today, while the technology is advancing and they're starting to look at more technology and more pricing data, I think they can now -- good shows and realize that some ways they keep price, 1, 2% of the house higher and achieved some of those economics versus the scalper while still pricing 98% of the house at a very stable brand position. So we can achieve both. This is an industry that for 30 years, we would do a tour. They would set three ticket prices 140, 79 and 39, and that will be the three prices in every city for every night for the market, as you know. That's way it's going to operate forward, a different price on a Friday in New York than Indianapolis on a Tuesday. So dynamic smart pricing, now that we're able to provide that sophistication, the bands are much more sophisticated. And they're now able to have tools to figure out how do I price it better and -- some better economics, get some of the leakage of secondary, but still maintain an overall ticket price, leaving dollars on the table, but still finding that balance between the consumer demand, the brand and the slippage of the economics to secondary they've been losing. Joe Berchtold : Sorry, Brandon. Sorry, Brandon. Sorry, just one comment I have to respond to. Your commentary about trickling out tickets, that's not a practice. That's not something that is the norm or something that we do. I think that the speed of ticketing has to do with just what's the pace at which some of them sell out with the theory being for some artists, if they price a lot of tickets at market price, they may not all sell out in the first hour, so it has nothing to do. Ticketmaster takes all the tickets. It gets -- puts them directly on sale. It does nothing to try to limit supply or anything in that manner. So I just want to make sure we're crystal clear on that. Brandon Ross : Yes. No, I wasn't agreed on that decision anyway. Michael Rapino : Yes. But I think we're just addressing because the marketplace. The consumer obviously gets a little -- time when at 10 :00, there's lots of secondary tickets, right? So historically, the Bruce fan would have been sold out at 10 and had to go to a secondary to buy that good seat. So today, we're sorting through that process where we can provide information to the fans. But our job at Ticketmasters is put every sale on ticket -- provide none into the secondary market and provide all the data to the artists that they can invest up and down and as the market adjusts. Brandon Ross : Got it. And then talking about dynamic pricing, if there was to be some kind of downturn in the next year or so that actually affected the live entertainment business, do you see kind of the same tools as flexibility to respond to market conditions in bringing ticket prices down as much as you bring them up in this demand environment? Joe Berchtold : Sure. Controls can be used -- go ahead, Michael. Michael Rapino : No. I said it before in our last call, I mean, we looked at the last recession, there was a single-digit back in some ticket sales, but we were -- years ago, not even in the same -- indication on pricing nor did we have the tool. So yes, we look at data pricing now, dynamic pricing, look at all market data algorithms to figure out what is the price point that we'll sell through. And we do believe that because of the upside right now in the premium secondary side of our business, that if we had to pull back ticket sales and dropped prices by 5% or 10% to match supply/demand of inflation, we have so much flexibility in pricing to get that done and still sell through the house and lower price if that was needed for a band to sell-through tickets. Joe Berchtold : And artist... Michael Rapino : The number one goal is to set -- their number one goal -- sell every ticket. So there are always going to be in a variable -- of how do I price it -- what do I got to reduce our end of house, front end of the house? What do we need to do a sell-through on a Tuesday night in Indianapolis? Let's adjust pricing. Joe Berchtold : The other part of the buffer, Brandon, is just the secondary market itself, and how big it is, its continued growth, right? I gave you the numbers. The secondary market for us grew 140% this quarter. So that tells you that even if some pricing is going up on the primary side, the secondary is growing up -- going up even faster, both in terms of volume and price points. So our first line of defense is keeping our eye on secondary and using that buffer if there is any variations in demand. Brandon Ross : Got it. And then finally, if you could just double-click a little on 30 additional venues that you're talking about adding. Are those -- what venue types are those? And how impactful do you see that to be in the future? Michael Rapino : Well, I think in our investor conference, we wanted to kind of highlight -- I think it's always been an under -- strong business, but we've put more focus on it from an operational design development. We've got over those 300 venues. We manage -- we've been adding 20 to 30 a year over the last few years. As you know, Boston been an incredible success in which will provide more return. And those 30 that we have in the pipe now, another 75 behind of those on a global basis are everything from clubs to arenas depending on where the hole in the market may exist. And we see great platform there. And as we've said before, when we show in an operated venue that we have the sponsorship and the ticketing and the food and beverage and all the revenue streams, that's our highest return for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Laszczyk : On fan growth for the year, maybe for Joe, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, not extrapolating international growth or contribution on the U.S. market this year. Can you maybe unpack that for us a little bit and maybe touch on what portion of fan growth you expect will come from acquisitions versus organic growth in markets like the U.S. or the U.K. this year? Joe Berchtold : Sure. I'll use as the basis, the 100-or-so million tickets that we sold through July because I think that just -- that gives the numbers and the facts. And as I indicated, within that, the U.S. is up about just over 30% and international was up 40-odd percent. So you have strong organic growth across both North America and international. Our primary acquisition, of course, would be OCESA, and that would be somewhat less than half of the international growth. So the international growth, even absent acquisitions would be in the mid- to high 20s. So again, this is not an acquisition dependent growth? This is organic plus acquisition. Stephen Laszczyk : Great. That's helpful. And then maybe one for Michael. I was curious if you're seeing any unique trends develop in terms of fan behavior this year. For example, we've seen more first-time concert goers come out this year or fan set to attend events with greater frequency. I'd be curious if you've seen any of those data points or any of these trends that you're seeing, open portions of the market up going forward that maybe you haven't seen come into the industry before? Joe Berchtold : Yes. I'll take this. Michael is having some audio problems here. I think that what we're seeing is a very broad-based, high priority of going to concerts against fans that are interested in going to concerts. So it's a bit of all of the above. We're certainly we have people who haven't gone to concerts in a long time going. We have concerts that will go to one, now going to two. We have concerts -- we have people that are going to many. So it's not -- I don't think you could pull it apart as one factor. I think you're seeing a broad-based high demand return to shows and when they're there, a broad-based pattern on site. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Glagola : Concert ticket prices, I want to go back to that being up 10% year-over-year versus 2019. Joe, can you just break out how much of this increase is being driven by market pricing versus price ticketing increases at the on sale? Joe Berchtold : Yes. As Michael said, the dynamically priced tickets represent a very small percentage of the overall tickets. So it's not going to be felt by most people. I would -- I don't have the exact numbers. I would guess that it's less than half of the impact is from that. And then there is a general increase. I can probably use the fact that the entry price of $33 is up about 5% from 2019 as a proxy for what's going on with the overall ticket pricing. And then maybe the remainder is driven by the more front-of-house activity. And again, those numbers are -- because there's a lot of attention on how much the overall ticket prices are up. If you look at the U.S. market, the U.S. is up between 12% and 13% in terms of inflation over the past three years as a comparative. Operator : Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. David Katz : I wanted to just get a little more color, if we can, about international markets and international landscapes. And if we obviously are seeing a lot of strong demand, is it relatively even if we look at international markets relative to the U.S.? Or are there any that are stronger or weaker, et cetera? Michael Rapino : Yes, we're seeing no difference right now in demand across the globe. You can look at, I guess, Springsteen just went on sale last week, global stadiums across Europe everywhere, sold out just as fast in Europe as it did here similar to Post Malone, Kendrick. So the tours that are selling here are selling it as fast in our international markets, Latin America, Mexico, continue to see completely record demand in all those markets. We're also still seeing walk up strong at our festivals and on-site as of last weekend, right? So that's kind of current data. There's still spending money. They're still buying tickets at high demand. So we have pullback yet in Europe or any international market. David Katz : Great. And am I permitted to follow up? Or would you prefer I went back in the queue? Michael Rapino : Go ahead. David Katz : Okay. With respect to digital initiatives around ticketing, if you could just talk about kind of -- it's obviously exciting and productive, sort of what inning you'd say we're in and any observation surprising or otherwise so far? Joe Berchtold : Yes, we're still in early innings. This is the first summer that we're really deploying at scale, the data and the technology so that we can reach out to fans once they bought the ticket, do upsells, first people who are going to shows that our venues, connecting them with sponsors, seeing some very good increases in our upsell levels as we talk about some of our average per fan spending, and the increase on premiums at our amphitheaters, for instance, more premium parking, more premium entry, VIP clubs. It's certainly enhanced by our ability to reach -- have a platform that can reach out and sell to those fans effectively, and you're not depending on them just figuring it out night of. So we're very happy with the early progress we're making. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Sundby : With Asia Pac still limited this quarter, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about, one, how quickly that ramps from here? And then maybe two, a little more on the long-term opportunity there volume, the recent acquisitions in Thailand and the Philippines, I think plans in place to bring Lollapalooza to India next year. Any color on how that kind of comes together and how large not really, that would be great? Michael Rapino : Yes, most of that, I think it was Asia reference. We're currently in 40 countries, hundred offices in 40 countries, varying degree of market share from the U.S. to Cape Town or South Africa. So we've got a global platform, and that was always our first priority. So we can say that any artists, we can put you on the road in any market sponsorship make it happen. Then when we get kind of our flag in the ground, we start to maybe launch or build festivals, operate venues, build up our ticketing, sponsorship and the model and the flywheel start to work. You can kind of look at our business across the globe, different markets we're in varying degrees of that growth. Latin America, we were very, very undeveloped in all markets. Obviously, now with OCESA, we've got that flywheel in Mexico. We bought festivals in Latin America with Rockland Rio and then bringing Lala, a lot of couple of promoters. We're going to get some venues going. So the flywheel is starting to work in Brazil and Colombia and Argentina, but we're kind of go from zero market share to big opportunity there. So that will continue to be a big focus for us. Western Europe, there's still some markets we're undeveloped in whether be Portugal or Spain, certain markets, we don't have the full flywheel and you'll see us continually add a festival or a promoter or a venue to those markets. Asia, we have a good platform. We have people on the ground. We've got a really strong business in Australia and New Zealand. But as we moved up to Pacific Rim, we've been slowly building the flywheel in all those markets. Japan is probably the one market that's the best and biggest in that market. We've got to do more work on that. But we look at Asia as really undeveloped territory, low market share, huge opportunity over the next while. We like everyone else in the world, we look at Asia, we look at Latin America, and we're looking to the Middle East and Eastern Europe is areas where we have no real market share. But that consumer now on TikTok knows that Drake dropped the video last night, whether they live in Singapore, India, Cape Town. So we've got a global product, and we've got lots of opportunity to keep growing. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Harrigan : Recognizing that you can't alter the weather or nature and there's an amphitheater season and all that, you're really inducing a lot of serial correlation, I think, activity among concertgoers. I mean people are going back and even when people, I think, go to movie theaters, you get people -- there's a hit movie and there tends to be a lot of repeat behavior. Do you think that all the initiatives you're undertaking are going to alter the seasonality in your business somewhat and maybe make Q4 a lot more active even on a relative basis than has historically been because it feels like there are a lot of things pushing in that direction if you take out concerns with weather and all that? Joe Berchtold : Yes. This is Joe. I gave you some numbers that in our amphitheaters. We do expect to have about 1 million more fans attending shows than we had in 2019. So, we're certainly seeing an extension of the amphitheater outdoor season, particularly through the more southern states. Theaters and clubs have always been very active in Q4. Arenas tend not to be quite as big just because it gets -- the routing gets interrupted by more of the holidays. So, we'll see a bit. I don't think it will dramatically change. Michael Rapino : But it will be -- why we look at our business as global. In the U.S., the arenas, NBA, NHL and NFL clog up the venues in the fall into the winter. But that's why we take a lot of these artists now and say let's go to Asia Pacific and Pacific Rim and Latin America. Let's get off-site middle of America and go to those markets as those open up. So there is a big 12-month-a-year business on a global basis. This industry is focused too much on the U.S. Western Europe summer business. But you are right, as the business expands in a lot of those markets, you have a 12-month strong market where you can put a sell-out show in other markets while you're waiting for a summer business here. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question. Paul Golding : Michael and Joe, congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to ask, given the strong demand that we're seeing across the board here and what I presume is some overflow in terms of demand that is unable to get a seat, where does streaming fit into the medium-term strategy now? I know it was more of a focal point, of course, during the pandemic, but just seeing opportunity for sponsorship or advertising through that. How much incremental focus will there be on that going forward or sort of walking back from that a bit? Just help us think about monetization there or investment if it's still a strategic point for you. Michael Rapino : I think we were clearing things a bit. We were not moved by the thesis that might have been for a moment that live is duplicated and digital. What we've always said that this magic two hours, you have to physically experience this. But we love the . It's a very unique space. It can't be duplicatable. But we've always said that we have all these shows and the most accessible, especially in dedicated fan, but you can expand that show and there's an audience that wants to watch their favorite artist over the weekend. We had an incredible broadcast on Hulu for today's high-quality filming and broadcasting live  festival, fabulous. So we've always thought the screen is an extension. It's great for our sponsorship business, where we have 900 sponsors looking always to be part of the show, both on and off. So, we love beats, we love the opportunity. We're doing thousands of shows. And we think it's an ancillary business that helps our overall sponsorship business as well as our committed festival business. Our business is so big now. I wouldn't say it's a material piece on its own. We never thought it would be, but it's another service we provide to both the artist, festival and sponsor, and it's something you have to be in. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I'd like to turn the call back to Michael Rapino for closing remarks. Michael Rapino : Thank you, everybody. Have a great summer, and we'll talk in the fall. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Live Nation delivered the biggest summer concert season in history that drove a record quarter. These results demonstrate the ongoing and increasing demand for live events globally, with attendance at events of all sizes from clubs to stadiums. Fans around the world continue prioritizing their spend on live events, particularly concerts. Despite varying economic headwinds, including inflation, we have not seen any pullback in demand as on-sales on-site spending, advertising, all other operating metrics continue showing strong year-on-year growth. With this demand, revenue was up over 60% relative to 2019 with each division up at least 30% and AOI up 45% to $621 million, with all divisions up at least 25%. As we expected, our performance this quarter was led by our concert business, which held 11,000 concerts to 44 million fans across 50 countries. As a result, we generated over $5 billion of revenue and $281 million AOI for the quarter, up 67% and 44% respectively relative to 2019 Q3. Shows of all types continue having strong demand with double-digit attendance growth across all venue types, including clubs, theaters, amphitheaters, arenas, stadiums and festivals. Stadiums had a particularly strong quarter with fan count more than tripling to nearly 9 million fans driven by the global demand of the top acts across a number of genres and audiences such as Bad Bunny, The Weeknd and Red Hot Chili Peppers. We delivered double-digit attendance growth across established and emerging markets around the globe from North America to Europe to South America showing our long runway of global growth. Our Venue Nation division hosted more fans with attendance up 14% relative to 2019 to $19 million for the quarter and 38 million fans year-to-date. Based on our current pacing, we expect to host more than 50 million fans at our Venue Nation and Festival division. As we have grown attendance, we have also continued driving greater market pricing for our concerts and now expect to transfer over $550 million of additional payments to artists this year, continuing our effort to help artists get the full value from their shows. And over the course of the summer, we continue to see strong onsite spend with no reduction in consumer buying habits. Ancillary per fan spending was up 20% to 30% year-to-date in our operated venues across the U.S. and Europe. The consistent theme is that fans are eager to enhance their experience, but we continue elevating our hospitality operations to provide more premium options. We still have tremendous room to expand these high-quality experiences throughout our venue portfolio, which includes over 400 venues and festivals globally, with almost 40 new venues in the pipeline. Fan demand for live events was also clear in our ticketing business. We transacted $6.7 billion of fee-generating GTV on 71 million tickets, up 69% and 42% respectively relative to 2019. This demand remained strong throughout the quarter as 2 of the 3 months were amongst the top 10 transacted GTV, excluding refund months ever. At this point, all top 10 months occurred within the past year. GTV growth was strong across both primary and secondary, up 61% and 132% respectively. Concerts were up 80% of the growth in primary GTV, while concerts and sports together accounted for over 90% of our secondary growth. Globally, new venue clients continue to seek out Ticketmaster\u2019s service due to its effectiveness of our enterprise software platform, driving venue revenue, combined with our leading online marketplace. As a result, we contracted 19 million net new tickets so far this year on a global basis. At Ticketmaster, we continue to advocate for fee transparency and live event ticketing. We advocated for all-in pricing mandate passed in New York early this year, which requires face value prices and fees to be shown upfront. And so we support the FTC mandating this nationally. We operate ticketing marketplaces in more than 30 countries around the world and have seen all-in pricing adopted successfully in many countries when mandated across the board. It only works with all ticketing marketplaces adopt together and the consumers truly can accurately compare as they shop for tickets. Sponsorship had its biggest quarter ever, following our previous record last quarter, driven by the strength of our festival and online partnerships. Our performance drove AOI of $226 million, 56% higher in 2019. Our sponsorship revenue growth has been broad-based with North America up 48% and international up 93% and we see strong demand both on-site and online, up 64% and 63% respectively this year. And our unique theater live events platforms continue to attract new brands and expand relationships with current partners. Festival sponsorship has been our largest growth driver to-date as we have effectively leveraged record festival attendance this year and compounded this growth with double-digit increases in per fan sponsorship. Platform integrations have been a great growth driver with online partnerships. As we continue to drive value and monetize opportunities via Ticketmaster\u2019s purchase process with non-service fee revenues, up double-digits relative to 2019. Clearly, 2022 has been an incredible year of returning to live events and we expect to finish strong. Ticket sales for concerts this year were up 34% for the quarter and now stand at 115 million tickets sold for the shows this year, up 37%. And more importantly, momentum is strong with early signs pointing to continued growth in 2023 across our businesses. Ticket sales for shows in 2023 are pacing even stronger than they were heading into 2022, up double-digits year-over-year, excluding sales from rescheduled shows. In our sponsorship business, confirmed commitments for 2023 are up 30% from this time last year, showing the resiliency and long-term commitments that brands have for our business. Beyond these specific leading indicators, going into 2023, we expect we will drive growth in our concert business by adding more venues to our portfolio, continued increase in ancillary per fan revenue and furthering our efforts to deliver market value for the shows to the artists. And in ticketing, we expect to also benefit from these market pricing trends while continuing to globally add new clients to our world class platform. With that, I will turn it over to Joe. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael and good afternoon everyone. As with last quarter, 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results. So, most of our discussion will be relative to Q3 of 2019. For the company, our reported revenue of $6.2 billion for the quarter was $2.4 billion better than Q3 2019 or an increase of 63%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $6.4 billion for the quarter. So, there was roughly a 3% impact due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This was a record quarter for revenue for the second quarter in a row and bested our Q2 figure by 39%. And our reported AOI of $621 million for the quarter was $194 million better than 2019, up 45% and led by an improvement of over $86 million in concerts and $81 million in sponsorship. On a constant currency basis, our Q3 AOI was $645 million. The FX impact of negative $24 million or 4% was largely driven by the devaluation of the euro and the pound. And year-to-date, we have converted roughly 76% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $996 million. Let me give a bit more color on each division then I will give you more on leading indicators. First, in concerts, our AOI was $281 million for the quarter, which compares to $194 million in Q3 of 2019, an improvement of 44%. U.S. concert\u2019s strongest quarter ever far surpassing the previous record of $200 million AOI in Q3 of 2018. It was a stellar summer season for concerts. We had over 44 million fans in the quarter, the most ever, growing 40% compared to Q3 of 2019 when we had close to 32 million fans. Looking a bit deeper at our fan metrics, stadium attendance more than tripled to 8.7 million fans in Q3 of this year and festival attendance was 6.5 million fans in the quarter, up nearly 40% from Q3 of 2019 with premier events, including Rock in Rio, Rock Werchter, Reading and Lollapalooza. Pricing has been a key part of our strategy in 2022 capturing market pricing for the best tickets while maintaining an affordable entry point for all fans. For tickets sold to shows at our amphitheaters, arenas and stadiums globally this year, front-of-house pricing increased for each by double-digits relative to 2019, while starting prices for all shows in the U.S. rose just 6% and remain under $35 on average. And giving you more details on ancillary per fan revenue by venue type in our U.S. amphitheaters, ancillary per fan revenue was $38, an increase of $8 per fan over 2019 levels or close to 30% growth. At our major festivals globally, increased spending on concessions, camping and VIP experiences drove ancillary per fan revenue up by nearly 30%. And that our theaters and clubs in the U.S. and the UK, ancillary per fan revenue increased by over 20%, driven by higher concession sales, fast lane entry, night of show upgrades and the move to cashless payments. On the cost side, as indicated before, increases continue to impact this primarily in the venues we operate, amphitheaters, theaters and clubs and festivals. But in all cases, we are delivering double-digit growth in profitability per fan due to increased ticket sales and ancillary revenue. Next, ticketing had another successful quarter, delivering $163 million in AOI, nearly 30% higher than Q3 of 2019. Q3 was our top quarter ever in terms of reported ticket sales in GTV and it was our second highest quarter ever in terms of transacted ticket sales in GTV behind only Q2 of this year. When we look at the year-to-date performance of our ticketing business, the numbers reflect the incredible demand we have had. Through September 30, we have sold 197 million fee-bearing tickets, up 38 million tickets or 24% compared to 2019. GTV for the first 9 months is $19 billion, up $6.3 billion or 49% compared to 2019. As a result, revenues are close to $1.6 billion for the first 9 months of the year, which is up almost $500 million or 45% compared to 2019. And with all this, we drove AOI to $600 million, up 71% as we deliver strong operating leverage. Across both sporting and concert events, ticket buyers continue to prioritize purchasing the best seats available, driving a 17% average price increase in the primary market year-to-date relative to 2019. Secondary pricing has risen by 10% on average with sales volume up as well. With these increases, the average secondary ticket price in the U.S. remains almost twice that of a primary ticket, demonstrating additional opportunities for market-based pricing as well as a large buffer from any demand shifts. For those of you focused on margins, as we have indicated previously, it\u2019s difficult to evaluate based on a single quarter. Q3 margins were impacted by our mix of clients and shows, along with technology investments. All of this is as expected and in line with our full year margin expectations in the high-30s as we have been indicating over the past few quarters. Finally, growth in our high-margin sponsorship business continued this quarter, with revenue up 59% relative to Q3 2019 and now up 64% year-to-date. We once again had high growth in both onsite and online sponsorship, driving record Q3 AOI of $226 million, 56% higher than our Q3 2019 AOI. Looking back at sponsorship\u2019s growth through the first 9 months, we have seen our festival business nearly double and our platform integrations more than double. Our strategic multiyear multi-asset sponsors now generate $0.75 billion in revenue for us. Back in 2017, we had 56 such clients, representing approximately two-thirds of our total sponsorship revenue. Today, that number has grown to over 100 such partners that account for 80% of our revenue, growth in both the number of partners and the level of their spend, which demonstrates the value we deliver and the importance they place on our unique on-site and online scale platforms. As we look to the remainder of 2022, starting with our leading indicators through late October, all relative to 2019, concert ticket sales are over 115 million tickets for events this year, up 37% and 20% higher than our full year 2019 fan count. Second, Ticketing has sold over 200 million primary fee-bearing tickets for events this year, up 27% relative to 2019 at this point. Of these, 135 million tickets are for concert events, which is 38% higher than 2019. Related to this, we had $1.9 billion in event-related deferred revenue, consistent with our levels in Q3 of 2021, despite the deferred shows in last year\u2019s numbers. Excluding the deferred shows from last year\u2019s numbers, we would be up 35% year-on-year. A few other points on 2022, given our presence in the UK and mainland Europe, we have experienced FX headwinds. And through the end of September, our AOI has been negatively impacted by $47 million. This was almost entirely in the second and third quarters as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the euro and British pound. Based on current forward rates, we expect a 4% impact to AOI in the final quarter of this year. Due to some delays in construction projects as a result of supply chain disruptions, our 2022 capital expenditures forecast is now approximately $300 million, with roughly two-thirds allocated to revenue-generating projects. We expect the key revenue-generating projects, which are delayed, will still be completed early next year. So don\u2019t anticipate any impact next year on the return from these projects. We expect free cash flow conversion from AOI to be in the mid to high 50s for the full year. We ended Q3 with $2.6 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to continue investing in growth. We are comfortable with our leverage with over 85% of our debt at a fixed rate, and our average cost of debt is roughly 4.5% positioning us well in this interest rate environment. In addition, the majority of our debt is long dated with only our 2023 convertible debt maturing within the next 2 years. We will continue to optimize our capital structure based on market conditions. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Ross : Hey, everyone. At this point, most investor focus is on 2023. So I wanted to dig a little more there. And I know it\u2019s hard to determine the demand side for the full year. But can you speak maybe quantitatively and qualitatively about the supply side for next year? I think last year, you gave that kind of top touring apps for the year ahead and what that looked like year-over-year. How is that trending? And then what\u2019s your view on the quality of the supply next year versus this current year? Michael Rapino : I\u2019ll start on the quality. We\u2019re seeing a really good pipe for next year. I would say there would be no difference in \u201823 to \u201822 in terms of quality. If you were a stadium act, a large selling arena act, you probably debated whether you went out in \u201822 or you went out in \u201823. So, lots of great artists in the pipe from clubs to stadiums to arenas. It will look like a similar year in terms of quality. Brandon Ross : Second piece. So... Joe Berchtold : Yes and \u2013 just a few other specifics. As Michael said, our sales for next year are up double digits. I mean if you want to take these three so-called quality references, we\u2019re most up in stadiums which, by their definition are going to be the largest artists that can sell the most tickets. So that would indicate we are off to a good quality start. The other is if we look at tickets sold per show that we have on sale for next year from amps, arenas, stadiums, festivals in all cases, our tickets sold at the on sales are up relative to what they were at this point last year for 2022 shows. So I think those are all good indicators of both the breadth and the depth of the supply that\u2019s going out. Brandon Ross : Great. And then keeping on \u201823, you said your book sponsorship is, I think, up 30% year-over-year. And that\u2019s kind of a different story than we\u2019re hearing across the ad and sponsorship universe. Have you seen any recent slowdown there? And why generally do you think your trends in Sponsorship are different than what we\u2019re seeing? Joe Berchtold : No. We haven\u2019t seen any slowdown. I think it\u2019s different pools of money from strategy. The Sponsorship relationships with us are not decided week-to-week, month-to-month based on what they are trying to get out of performance marketing. These are long-term commitments by major brands. Michael gave you the stats. It\u2019s really being driven by these big multiyear, multi-asset, multimillion-dollar relationships. So we\u2019re up 30% with over half our book of business for next year already filled and not seeing a slowdown. So we\u2019re feeling very comfortable with it. Michael Rapino : Brandon, for comparison, the \u2013 if the NFL was a public company or NBA, I\u2019m sure that would be reporting record sponsorship also. So we kind of put us off from that league, right? He\u2019s not having any pullback. If you\u2019ve got a scarce commodity like a beyond state tour or an NFL game, those are still very rare pieces of business that you want to be associated with, and they have longevity to them. So we haven\u2019t seen any slowdown talking to the NBA and NFL. We haven\u2019t seen it over there either. So I think those are the comparables for you. Brandon Ross : Okay. And then just finally, on the regulatory front, there is noise is kind of there always is. What would \u2013 I know you went on the offensive on the Ticketing transparency, but what would be the fallout if there are changes to that law for you? And is there any other potential pressure, regulatory pressure that you\u2019re seeing or otherwise contending with right now? Joe Berchtold : Yes. We don\u2019t believe there will be any impact whatsoever if there was a nationwide mandate for all-in pricing. We think it makes sense. It just has to be done collectively at the same time. And if you look back and you listen to the comments, the comments were all about transparency, which is really all-in pricing. The commentary was not about fee levels or any of the other issues that some people have brought up. That\u2019s been looked at, and we feel comfortable with what our business model is in that regard. So I think that we will work with the FTC. We will work with the DA in the State of New York, and we\u2019re very supportive of that and some other shifts to make ticketing more transparent and a better consumer experience. Michael Rapino : Just a couple of points to jump on, we tend to do better as regulation comes into play in this space. A lot of our business has been chasing the secondary business for years that\u2019s kind of unregulated. We would love spec selling to be outlawed. We\u2019d love better rules on bot ticketing. We love all-in pricing. We\u2019re adhering to all-in pricing in New York right now. I think we\u2019re probably the only ticketing company actually adhering to those regulations right now. So we like sunlight coming to the business. The most part of the business that\u2019s been unregulated and most of the noise is generated from the secondary business. So we love regulation, puts us on an equal footing ground. Right now, in our secondary business, we don\u2019t do spec selling. That\u2019s probably 30% to 40% of what inventory sits on secondary sites. We don\u2019t price below face value. So we actually operate at a disadvantage right now because we are operating in a higher standard. So we had a lot more transparency. We\u2019d love to have the fees more transparent upfront, all-in pricing. We just have to make sure everybody plays by the same rules, but we\u2019re going to lead those pieces. As far as the fees, just to remind you, it\u2019s the venues that set the fee and take most of the fees. So I think if you bought \u2013 if you build a multi-hundred million arena or a stadium, I think your prerogative to decide what is the fee you want to charge on your sports and music tickets. We get a piece of that, but those are set by the venue and monetized by the venue. So just kind of some of the ongoing transparencies of the business, we\u2019ve got to do a better job explaining. Brandon Ross : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. David Karnovsky : Thanks. Maybe I\u2019ll flip Brandon\u2019s first question around and push on the demand side. But you\u2019ve been able to maintain AOI growth in a low double-digit range over a long period. And you\u2019ve done that in markets even a time for fan attendance has been down. And I know you just spoke to the supply, but given that uncertain demand environment, how do you think about some of the other factors in your control on revenue or cost that can kind of keep you in that historical range? Michael Rapino : I\u2019m going to let Joe jump in, but I just want to make sure, don\u2019t discount the supply side, right? That\u2019s like talking to Disney and saying, if you only have Marvel movies, how is your demand going to be? It\u2019s going to be great. Supply and content drives the demand. So if you\u2019ve got a lot of great, great quality supply, the demand is a little easier. So I don\u2019t want you to discount that. We\u2019re very proud that we work with the best artists in the world. We have the best global platform for those artists and attractive to our platform. That\u2019s what you have to make sure you first have. So we have the blockbusters top to bottom. That\u2019s going to drive the demand. Now Joe will take over in terms of explaining the demand strength so far we\u2019ve seen. Joe Berchtold : Yes. So again, just to \u2013 I mean, to repeat the numbers, which are the mix of supply and demand, which is that our tickets sold for the shows that we have on sale for next year are up consistently across all venue types relative to a year ago. So the demand is absolutely coming for the supply that\u2019s showing up. Now on a broader basis, you\u2019re right, we\u2019ve consistently \u2013 if you looked at 2010 to 2019, we\u2019ve consistently grown our business double-digit AOI. In 2011, we grew our business double-digit AOI while fan attendance was down. So we do have a number of other levers, and Michael spoke to those as part of his commentary. We\u2019re continuing to grow our venue base. And fans that shows in our venues are much more profitable than others. We continue to have increased on-site spend. We continue to have pricing as a lever, which drives through both our concerts business and our ticketing business continuing to add globally Ticketmaster clients. And then I\u2019ve given you the numbers on Sponsorship, which we think continues to be a double-digit growth business into the future. So all of those levers on top of the supply-demand dynamic is what gives us confidence as we continue to look to our future of the growth potential. Michael Rapino : And Joe, I just want to jump in on the demand in terms of how the demand is spread. There is certain thesis as they like to get spread. Our demand is \u2013 overall concert ticket is still a really affordable ticket. Most majority of the tickets are sold are $50 to $75. So, although we have a great premium business that does attract a high-end customer or someone that\u2019s a rapid fan, our business is split from clubs to theaters to stadiums, we\u2019re seeing demand strong on all levels. Whether it\u2019s a $19 ticket, it\u2019s filling up the clubs or the premium at the stadiums and arenas. So we do think we have something for everyone. It is a very accessible ticket even in a pull back time. And we\u2019re seeing that the demographic of our buyer is very, very wide and split across all sizes. Joe Berchtold : Yes, Michael, sorry, just to jump back in on you. Again, counter to some of the commentary that I\u2019ve heard out there were also \u2013 we\u2019re not dependent on acts that have been around for a long time. If you look at how vibrant the new artists are \u2013 I mean, I look at our top artists we\u2019ve had this year, the Harry Styles, Dua Lipas, Billy Eilish, Bad Bunny, Morgan Wallen, The Weeknd, Olivia Rodrigo. These are all artists that are at the early stages of their career. Across, as Michael talked about, all genres, most of those are obviously in arenas and stadiums, but these are tremendous talents that are just showing the breadth of supply that we have in our business. David Karnovsky : Okay. And then I had a question on online sponsorship, which is really strong in the quarter. How do we think about the driver of growth here in terms of band or traffic increases on your website or apps versus actions which are more in your control, like the platform integration, as you mentioned? And then how much kind of room is there to grow some of these sponsorships? Joe Berchtold : Yes. Our focus this year has obviously been on the latter of how do we create new assets on this Ticketmaster platform that can continue to drive the economics. And then as you improve your volume of tickets or improve your site visits, the math is just additional growth on top of that. So, we feel like we would view any other platform we own in its own way just a counterpart to the on-site. We have people\u2019s attention through a period of time. We have them going through a purchase process. And all of that is something that we can monetize. We saw a great progress on the platform integrations, particularly around the checkout this year. We think there is earlier upstream. We think there is advertising dollars that can still be significant that we can drive from it. And we are focused much more on how do we use Ticketmaster as a platform to drive its own set of non-service fee revenue streams. And we think that has a long runway. David Karnovsky : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Laszczyk : Hey. Great. Thank you. Maybe one for Michael on pricing, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the advice you are giving to most artists with respect to pricing their concerts next year. Is your messaging more that maybe there is still some opportunity to take price, given the strong demand that you are seeing this year, or is maybe at \u201823 is a year where artists need to be a little bit more focused on selling out rather than taking price? Michael Rapino : Yes. I wouldn\u2019t say \u201823 \u2013 our conversation is any different than it\u2019s been in any year. We have an incredible \u2013 great pricing team, a lot of data scientists that are talking and analyzing the business with our managers and agents. So, as you know, there is no one paint brush, depending on what artists \u2013 where you are in your cycle and what your demand is. So, I just saw some counts this morning for Shenoy [ph] went up, up-sell. Today, big, big numbers out of the box. She is an iconic artist. So, you are not worried about pricing if you are talking to Shenoy and how she prices her tour, if you are a little baby going on tour next year. You have a younger demo, you are building your audience, maximizing your growth isn\u2019t your priority. It\u2019s getting to as many markets and fans as you can. So, I wouldn\u2019t say \u201823 is even in my buyers\u2019 minds right now. What is in their head is over the last few years, it\u2019s just better pricing dynamic strategy from day one on the market. Price is different on a Friday than a Tuesday, the aisle seat\u2019s worth more than the middle. The front is always underpriced. We have yet to see anything get close to secondary demand yet. So, most of our shows are still going to be underpriced in the front. So, our job is to do what we can up-sell the front, so we can lower the price in the back, get sell-through all the way through. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that any artist or manager is having any panic of talking to me about demand for next year. They know the Taylor Swift ticket Verified Fan that went up this week that\u2019s probably going to break all records. I mean artists are seeing the demand is there. If you price it smart, you have got the right markets. You have been out of the market maybe 3 years, 4 years. We are not feeling the demand from inflation or \u201823 pressures that are driving strategy. It\u2019s just overall us being better at what we do today than we were last year and the year before on pricing strategy per market by artist for territory. Stephen Laszczyk : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then perhaps somewhat related to that, secondary GTV grew more than twice as fast as primary GTV in the third quarter, could you just comment on some of the key factors driving that outsized growth in secondary? And is this something you think you can continue in light of the pricing strategy you outlined? Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think as Michael will talk to you, first and foremost, our strategy is to help ours get paid market value for their show. And we are spending more and more on having the people and the data to help them do that. That said, for a lot of reasons that he went over around how they want to build their fan base, how they want to build their brands, they are leaving money on the table. And we are continuing to see that just almost insatiable demand in the secondary market. I talked about average price of a secondary ticket is still almost twice that of a primary ticket. So, that continues to grow, and we continue to price a little bit trying to catch up to that. So, we don\u2019t see the secondary market going away anytime soon, and we are going to be active participants. And I talked, I think last quarter about the fact that we believe the shift to secondary tickets has helped us because it\u2019s just eliminated friction to use us as the secondary platform to buy and sell the tickets. As we get better and better with that Ticketmaster app, you can manage your tickets, you can sell them, you can buy them on our secondary. As all of that gets easier and easier, I think that just naturally continues to build the business with us. Stephen Laszczyk : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Glagola : Hi. Thanks for the question. Michael and Joe, can you maybe just update us on \u2013 and I know you spoke earlier around the regulatory risk and concerns around \u2013 on FTC regulation and all-in pricing. But I think there is also investor concerns around the DoJ still. And maybe just update us where things stand with your consent decree? And maybe also touching on in relation to that, client wins on ticketing have been very strong over the last 21 months, 36 million in tickets. So, maybe the competitiveness of the primary ticketing market in the United States and how you see that relative to those wins and with regards to regulation? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : As regards to the consent decree, we have an ongoing discussion. We have an external monitor who we have regular dialogue with. We have an internal monitor who oversees everything. We are very happy that we have got an active dialogue now, which is what was lacking in the first 10 years post our merger. We feel good about all of those discussions. I don\u2019t think there is anything structural, substantive that we are finding that\u2019s inconsistent with the message that we send all of our people, which is these are independent decisions on promotion and ticketing and the two shouldn\u2019t be tied together. So, we feel good about that process that we have with them. As we look at Ticketmaster, I think it\u2019s continuing to be successful because it\u2019s a very effective platform. I think if you look at \u2013 again, we have talked a lot over the past few quarters about because of our continually improving in high-quality platform, both for the enterprise side as well as the customer side, particularly internationally, that\u2019s differentiated and driving a lot of wins internationally. North America, where it\u2019s more a mature market, you need to be able to compete on price in addition to features. And I think our business has shown that we can continue to scale that, grow it and do so very profitably. Stephen Glagola : Thanks Joe. And if \u2013 I just have one more follow-up here. On industry publications, have reported a trend of tickets for top-tier act seen strong demand and then the lesser known and emerging artists are struggling. I know you had some commentary today where that wasn\u2019t the case. But as you look out over the next 12 months or so, does that \u2013 are you seeing that potentially an impact on your business or a trend? And maybe can you just talk about both of those segments of artists in a recessionary environment and how they would hold up the high-end top-tier acts relative to the emerging artists and lesser known ones? Thanks. Michael Rapino : Yes. Just on a macro level, this is a business that overall we don\u2019t win \u2013 most shows don\u2019t sell out. Majority of your shows don\u2019t sell out, always room for a few more tickets to be sold. So, although the press always talks about the expensive tickets or the sold-out ticket, that\u2019s not your real business. Your real business is night and day, theater, clubs, amphitheaters, arenas, selling those tickets night by night. So, most tours ultimately do well in the end, artists make money and we make money. There are some tours a small percentage that just don\u2019t sell enough ticket, the demand isn\u2019t there. And the tour that gets canceled or the promoter and the artist lose money. So, I have seen some of those publications where they want to grab those six tours or some that didn\u2019t make money and then try to extrapolate something larger. So, I just don\u2019t see that trend. We did over 8,000 club shows last year and 95% are going to make money and do well and the artists will deliver those 400 tickets or 1,100 tickets as they are building their business and their costs are associated with it. It was a tougher year for all of the industry as the supply chain challenges, labor, everyone getting back to work, getting the security guards, everyone\u2019s costs were up this year. So, that would have affected all artists on the road relative to their revenue. But those seem to have worked their way through the system. So, I don\u2019t see any trend that the emerging or younger artists are having any harder time than any young emerging artists when they are taking those risks building their businesses on the way up. Generally, majority are going to be okay in terms of selling enough tickets, paying the bills and building their business. So, we don\u2019t see any trends in the bottom end, any new trends that would suggest that the club and the emerging artists space isn\u2019t growing. There is more clubs opening up all the time, lots of demand in every market, lots of options for artists to play 500 seats, 1,000 seats. We just know from our venue portfolio on the demand on opening up and building theaters and clubs is bigger than ever. So, that demand wouldn\u2019t be driven if the supply wasn\u2019t there. Stephen Glagola : Thank you, Michael. Appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Peter Supino : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First on Taylor Swift, I just want to say with my 16-year-old daughter and I are signed up for the pre-sale, very much appreciate you support on the 15th of the month. Moving on, in the press release, you highlighted that growth in your concert business in \u201823 will come from adding more venues to your operating portfolio and increasing ancillary per fan revenue. So, we didn\u2019t see any mention of fan growth. And then in the discussion today, we have obviously heard a lot of talk about a robust first half of \u201823. And so if you will forgive me kind of picking up this \u201823 topic, again, I would love to understand how much visibility the company has into the second half of the year. I think booking cycles for the big venues are six months to nine months out. So, that\u2019s one question. And second one was just as strong as your fan growth has been this year, does this change how aggressively you might go out and invest in new venues, possibly larger ones, even ones outside of the country? Thanks so much. Joe Berchtold : So, just technically, Peter, just to answer your first question, I think the way that we have laid out the story in the release and then Michael talked about it is, first, he talked about the fact that ticket sales are up. He talked about the sponsorship growth. And then he said, in addition to those, there are a number of other levers that we have to continue to grow the business. So, I don\u2019t think he ever said anything that said we weren\u2019t \u2013 the fan growth didn\u2019t come into this. At this point, looking at \u201823, yes, we have got some of the stadiums we talked about high growth in arenas. Some of that\u2019s booked. It\u2019s still somewhat early for the second half of the year. But macro in terms of our pipeline for next year, it would account for more fans than we had going into this year. The hard part that we have is just sorting out because of the shows that were rescheduled, trying to figure out how many of those were naturally flown into this year versus not. But we are feeling very good about the attendance levels for next year. Michael will talk about the venues. Michael Rapino : Yes. I think just on Joe\u2019s point, we are excited to be sitting here. We knew the thesis that you could sell on was that there was an air pocket. We heard that comment a lot \u201823 was an exceptional year. And it was \u2013 \u201822, I mean been an exceptional year. The idea that we were able to grow this business for so long on our high-double digits on \u2013 high-single digits on our fan base and then to have a year like \u201822, you blow the doors off it, and now to be able to sit here and say, and we think we will still grow on top. We are very proud of our business and our outlook, given the headwinds and the size of the gains we had this year. So, we are looking into now beyond that and how we keep growing the business forward. Venues, I have laid out over the last year or 2 years, we think it\u2019s a great business. We have 300 in our portfolio. It\u2019s a great way to obviously maximize that live event fully when you are vertical. So, we like our global pipeline we have right now. We are seeing a lot of white space where our content can help drive that business case from arenas to amphitheaters to big ballrooms and theaters. So, you will continually see us adding as we have been over the last many years to that portfolio. Peter Supino : Thanks Michael. Thanks Joe. Operator : We have time for one final question from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. David Katz : Thanks for taking my question. In the past, you have talked about the evolution of digital ticketing. And I know there was some commentary, I believe in the spending to that end. An update on sort of how that\u2019s progressed, where it is and what we might expect in the near-term and longer term would be helpful, please. Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think digital ticketing at this point is nearly ubiquitous in North America. It has grown rapidly internationally. It\u2019s still a year or 2 years behind. I would expect this to be pretty much there sometime between next year and maybe the year after, just depending a bit by market. And as it\u2019s gotten established, it\u2019s already helped us in a number of areas. I talked about secondary a few minutes ago. So, we are seeing some direct benefits as we continue to improve the ability in terms of how fans manage their tickets. I think you will continue to see more products get added on to the app. They continue to improve what the fan \u2013 how the fans can manage their tickets. And then it sets us up for the advertising and up-sells that we have been talking about. And we now have enough scale. We started doing some things this year at scale, working with sponsors who want to deliver value on site to our fans, working with the concert side of the business to enable direct up-sells. And I think all of those features that come from having a direct connection to the people actually attending the shows will be a key focus for how we continue to drive our sponsorship business over the next few years. David Katz : And there is a sort of clear quantifiable earnings benefit where the rubber meets the road from that, correct? Joe Berchtold : Yes. And I think you see part of that as we talked about what is our non-Ticketmaster, what\u2019s our non-service fee revenue that we are driving and the fact that, that\u2019s up double digits from \u201819. This is all a part of that. David Katz : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mike for closing comments. End of Q&A: Michael Rapino : Thank you everyone. We will see you at our Investor Day in Liberty in November. You can check our website for more details. Thank you.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In 2022, fans around the world continue to prioritize their spend on attending live events, particularly concerts. Our research consistently tells us that concerts are top priority for discretionary spending. And one of the last experiences fans will cut back on. And we're seeing this play out in both our 2022 results and early indicators for 2023. With the strong demand last year in the cancer business, we had 121 million fans attend our shows across 45 countries. While in ticketing, we helped connect 550 million fans with their favorite artists, teams and performers. In both cases, the majority of our growth came from international markets, further reinforcing the global nature of untapped fan demand and the opportunities we have for growth as we help artists reach more fans with their live music. Before getting into details on our division, just to note that 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results. Most of our metrics will be relative to full year 2019. In concerts, despite many markets still closed for part of last year, we grew attendance by 24% to 121 million fans at 44,000 events, which drove revenue up 43% to $13.5 billion. This growth came from all markets and venue types. Every venue type from clubs and theaters, to stadiums, to festivals, had double-digit attendance growth. We invested $9.6 billion in putting artist shows on in 2022, working with the largest superstars to artists just getting started and all those in between. This is up 45% and further reinforces our role as the largest contributor to our artist income. As part of this, we helped shift $700 million to artists with more market value ticket pricing, even as the entry price to a show stayed below $35 in the U.S. Typically, 90% of ticket sales for Live Nation shows go to artists. This is particularly important as artists are increasingly reliant on touring as they get much smaller rev shares from other music revenue streams. Part of our fan growth continues to come from the venues we operate globally, closed almost 50 million fans in 2022 with international markets, again, delivering the majority of our growth. In Venue Nation, we continued our focus on elevating the fan experience and providing a range of options for enhanced products and services. As a result, last year, we grew our average revenue per fan by 20% at all venue types. In ticketing, our strategy for success is simple. We focus on developing the leading software for venues to ensure we deliver the best enterprise platform, we invest tens of millions of dollars every year to continue innovating every aspect of ticketing technology products. Artists are the venue's largest clients, and we're regularly being asked to create new products to help address their ticketing needs. Amongst our innovations are products such as Verified Fan, designed to help artists cut down resale, and we've seen this successfully for over 400 tours, including the most recent on sales for Beyonce\u0301, Madonna and Morgan Wallen. Generally, Verified Fan onsales have approximately 5% in inventory end up on resale sites versus 20% to 30% that is typical for non-Verified Fan on sales. Venue and their artist clients see the result in the ticket sales, which is the large part why so many venues choose to work with us. Looking at our 2022 results, we grew fee-bearing ticket volume by 28% to $280 million, which in turn drove our fee-bearing GTV, up by over 50% to $28 billion across 38 countries. As a result, our ticketing revenue was $2.2 billion, up 45%. Along with these results for the year, we signed 23 million net new tickets in 2022, 70% were with international clients in the stage for continued global growth. In our sponsorship business, we have seen that brands are as eager as fans to reengage with platforms. In 2022, we had 120 large strategic sponsors globally across our businesses, 32% more than we had in 2019, including brands such as PayPal, Go PoP, Google and Snap. These large partners drove over 80% of our growth, with overall revenue up 64% to $1 billion. As with concerts and ticketing, our international markets led this growth with international sponsorship ROI up 70%. Looking ahead to 2023, as we announce any of our 2023 shows on sale. We continue to see strong consumer demand globally with no sign of any slowdown. We have four key leading indicators at this time of the year, all pointing towards another record year and even greater success in 2023. First, our deferred revenue at the end of 2022 was $2.7 billion, up 125% from 2019 and 18% from 2021, which benefited from a high volume of rescheduled chose. Next, as of mid-February, ticket sales for our shows this year exceeded 50 million fans, up 20% from this point last year with international growth of 25%. Then our global ticketing fee-bearing GTV is up 33% to $9.8 billion through the same period. And finally, over 70% of our planned sponsorship activity for the year is confirmed, again, up double digits relative to this time last year. Before I turn it over to Joe, I want to comment on the regulatory environment and industry reforms. On the regulatory front, the ticketing industry is more competitive than ever, and our market share has gone down, not up since the merger. Because of the competitive bidding process, venues regularly take more of the economics on every renewal as they set and keep a majority of the service fees. In signing the extended consent decree related to the Ticketmaster merger, we remain in constant conversations with the DOJ monitors and do not believe there have been any violations. On ticketing reforms, we believe the greater transparency on the entire ticketing ecosystem will improve the industry, and we've been engaging with policymakers to advocate for reforms. The biggest challenge facing the industry is a chaos at the on sale where fans can't get the ticket at the price they are set yet they see page of secondary sites with tickets five times the face value because of scalpers. This has been a big topic in the industry and conversations at the pulse our live conference this week, focused on how to protect the connection between the artists and their fans. To help drive progress, we launched the Fair Ticketing Act, which says artists should decide resell lots selling, speculative tickets should be illegal. The scope of the BOT Act should be expanded and enforced. And it needs to be industry-wide all-in pricing, so fans see the full cost they are paying upfront. Artists create their music and their concerts. It's only fair to create their ticket and rules too. We will always be on the side of the artist who is the best advocate for their career and their fan base. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more details. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the uniqueness with our seasonality in 2022 after emerging from the pandemic, I will largely focus on our annual results. And as with prior quarters, 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results so much of our discussion will be relative to the full year 2019. For the company, our reported revenue of $16.7 billion for the year was $5.1 billion better than 2019 or an increase of 44%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $17.3 billion for the year. So there was roughly a 4% unfavorable impact due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the euro and the pound. Our reported AOI of $1.407 billion for the year was also a record for the company, $465 million better than 2019, up 49%, led by an improvement of $345 million in ticketing and $226 million in sponsorship. On a constant currency basis, our full year AOI was $1.464 billion. The FX impact was negative $57 million or 4%. And we have converted roughly 69% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $967 million, leading to a year-end free cash balance of nearly $1.8 billion. Net income for the year was also a record at $296 million, $226 million better than 2019, resulting in earnings per share of $0.64. Let me give a bit more color on each division. First, in concerts, we had the most concert fans ever with 121 million fans attending our shows in 2022, up 24% compared to 2019 when we had close to 98 million fans. Show count was 43,600 events, up 8% compared to 2019, with more fans per show due to a heavier mix of stadium and festival events. As a result, our concerts revenue for the year grew by 43% to $13.5 billion, while we delivered $170 million of AOI. Looking a bit deeper at our fan metrics. We had strong growth across the board. Stadium attendance more than doubled to 18.4 million fans this year up from 7.8 million fans in 2019. Festival attendance was 13.2 million fans for the year, up over 30% from 2019, with premier events, including Rock in Rio in Brazil, Rock Werchter in Belgium, Reading & Leeds in the UK and Lollapalooza in Chicago. Arena, amphitheater and club and theater attendance were all up double digits. And finally, our international fan count grew by nearly 50% in 2022, fueled by tremendous outdoor season in the UK and across Mainland Europe, and very strong growth in our South American markets as well as the addition of OCESA in Mexico. Giving you more details on ancillary per fan revenue by venue type, in our North America amphitheaters ancillary per fan revenue was $37, an increase of $8 per fan over 2019 levels or over 25% growth. At our major festivals globally, increased spending on concessions, camping and DIP experiences drove ancillary per fan revenue up nearly 30%. And there are theaters and clubs in the U.S. and the UK ancillary per fan revenue increased by 20%, driven by higher concession sales, fast lane entry, night of show upgrades and the move to cashless payments. As we have discussed in past quarters, we've had some headwinds associated with labor and supply chain cost pressures at venues we operate, notably amphitheaters and festivals as well as costs related to the reopening of our international markets during the year. Despite this, we still increased our per fan profitability, taking into account our company-wide revenue streams for fans attending shows at our venues. We have seen these pressures subside in recent months and do not expect the same level of impact in 2023. With this, along with our ongoing revenue initiatives and continued cost focus, we expect to continue to grow per fan profitability in 2023. Next, ticketing, where our numbers reflect sustained fan demand for the live experience. In 2022, we sold $281 million fee-bearing tickets, up 28% compared to 2019. It was the first year that our fee-bearing ticket sales exceeded non-fee-bearing ticket sales as we continue to build our global non-sports client base, particularly in international markets. With this increased ticket volume, GTV for the year was $27.5 billion, up 54% compared to 2019. Ours continues to be largely a primary ticketing business with secondary ticketing accounting for only a mid-teens percent of our overall GTV. With this activity level, revenues are over $2.2 billion for the year with AOI of $830 million. As we projected last quarter, we delivered full year margins in the high 30s, coming in at 37%. On the pricing front, average ticket prices on primary tickets rose by 17% compared to 2019, driven by fan demand for the best seats at premier concert and sporting events. Secondary ticketing pricing also rose by 12% on average and so the average secondary ticket price in the U.S. remained more than double that of a primary ticket. This shows the extent to which concerts and other live events remain priced below market value. We also saw revenue from nonservice fees grow double digits as we further build ancillary revenue streams, including insurance, upgrades and other upsells. Lastly, as Michael noted, we signed 23 million net new tickets and expect these client wins will help drive an increase in fee-bearing tickets sold for this year, positioning us for ongoing growth. Before leaving ticketing, I wanted to add a few comments on the regulatory front that Michael spoke to you. There has been a lot of discussion lately about so-called junk fees. We tend to get thrown into that conversation because the compensation to venues to help run their businesses and to Ticketmaster to distribute tickets is separately called out as a service fee instead of embedded in the price of the ticket. Very few people understand that and even fewer understand that most of the money goes to the venues. They think the service charges are just some arbitrary add-on to Ticketmaster pockets, which is not the case. We agree that real junk fees, hidden charges attached the goods and services that obscure the true price should be illegal. As one of the reasons we're advocating for legislation mandating all-in pricing where the consumer first sees the total price he or she is going to pay, as well as the breakdown of any fees. There are a range of other policy points that we're advocating for because we're strong proponents of artists and content rights, but none of these have a direct material impact on our business. Finally, it was a record year for our sponsorship business with top line revenue of $968 million, up 64%. Our AOI for this high-margin business was $592 million, up 62%. Looking back at sponsorship's growth during the year, our festival business increased by 75% and our platform integrations more than doubled. Once again, we had high growth in both on-site and online sponsorship of 61% and 64%, respectively, compared to 2019. Our international markets had an exceptional growth rate this year with AOI increasing by over 70% compared to 2019 due to greater festival activity across Europe and our expanding business in South America and Mexico. A few other points on 2023, while it's still very early in the year, based on current FX rates, we project very little impact on our revenue and AOI this year, less than 1%. We expect CapEx to be approximately $450 million this year, with two thirds on revenue-generating projects, including new venue builds and renewals and as well as other organic investments to support our growth. This is slightly higher relative to the past few years as we come out of supply chain constraints and generally tight spend controls. However, as a percentage of revenue, this is well within our historical range and consistent with our growth trajectory. We ended the year with $2.3 billion of available liquidity between free cash an untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to continue investing in growth. As you're aware, in January, we issued $1 billion principal amount of 3.8 percent convertible senior notes due in 2029. As part of that transaction, we then developed a hedge to increase the effective convert price to $144. We used roughly half the net proceeds to repurchase the 2.5% convertible notes that were due in 2023, meaning we expect minimal dilution from this convert offering. We're comfortable with our leverage. Over 85% of our debt is at a fixed rate with an average cost of debt of roughly 4.7%, positioning us well in this interest rate environment. In addition, the majority of our debt is long dated and nothing is maturing within the next 18 months. Given that we're at the beginning of the year, we want to provide with more guidance on a few line items below AOI, which impact our earnings per share calculation. We anticipate the noncash compensation will be largely in line with 2022 and acquisition transaction expenses will run about two thirds of last year. As we continue our global expansion, we expect depreciation and amortization to grow by approximately $50 million for the year, evenly phased amongst the quarters. Given our recent financing, interest expense will increase to approximately $90 million per quarter. We're projecting accretion to be about 25% higher than last year, resulting from stronger forecasted future performance at a number of our joint ventures. And we anticipate that NCI and income tax expense will grow in line with AOI. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with Lightshed Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Ross : Yes thanks for taking the question. You laid out your prescription for solving many of the structural issues in ticketing today. But there is a lot of elected officials and fans that think you're way too big despite the slipping share that you highlighted. And I want to know why are both your ticketing and promotion business is so dominant? And why wouldn't a more competitive industry solve any of these issues at hand with the ticket buying experience? Joe Berchtold : Thanks Brandon. It's Joe. I think when you look at our business, our business in both concerts and ticketing have been successful because they very effectively serve their constituents. So on the concert side, I mean if you go back to ten years, we and AG were roughly similar size. We've had a very focused strategy of super serving the artist, which has led to a lot of success in terms of continuing to work with more of the artists. In ticketing, we have the best product out there, full stop. Michael spoke to why it is, we've been effective continuing to work with a large number of venues because we have the best software platform for them, and we work with them to develop tools and products for artists who are their key constituents when figuring out where they're going to be touring. So, it's hard to answer your question with where would we be if we didn't have someone who developed such great tools for the venues and such, and serve the artists so well, I think, we would have a smaller industry. I think we have consistently grown the industry through our approaches to the business. And overall, the ecosystem is better for it. Brandon Ross : Okay. And then you talked about the amount of junk that's in ticket fees, and it's a huge concern of, I think, fans and regulators. The amount of fees or the percentage of fees that go into each ticket sale. Can you get a little more granular on why ticket prices are so high? What percentage of the fees goes to you and what is \u201cjunk\u201d? And then you have these growing junk fees, you're giving venues of bigger and bigger cut, and now there's the consumer and regulatory pressure, why should the investors be worried about the sustainability of the Ticketmaster and the Live Nation O&O venue ticket fees as we look to the future? Joe Berchtold : Yes. Just first, correction, these aren't junk fees. Junk fees are low-value hidden fees to show up later. This is our version of the markup of the base wholesale price of the product is shared by us and the venue. Amazon collects 50% of the retail price, Apple collects 30%. So this is a version of the amount of the money that goes the venue for the services they provide, Ticketmaster for the services they provide. So it's not junk fees. What we've said is that the majority of the fees go to the venue. And typically, when you renew with a venue because of the competitive nature of the bidding process, more of the fees goes to the venue. I don't think it makes much sense for us to give exact breakdowns because then, obviously, everybody below the average in the next discussion once they get to be above the average. And so it's not a very commercially wise move for us to give those specific numbers. But generally, that's been the trend, and that's what's been happening. The venue sets the fees and the venues costs have been going up, service fees have been going up. I think it would be a very unique situation where you would tell the building what their fees could be. I think it's more likely you got all-in pricing, where they see the total cost upfront quite transparently. And frankly, if you were to cap fees, what would end up happening is you then have increased rent and other costs for the artists would go up because the venue needs to recoup their costs as part of the ecosystem. Brandon Ross : So you are saying if ticket prices or ticket fees were regulated, then ticket prices would just stay the same because they would just be passed on in another way? Joe Berchtold : Very possible that's what happened, yes. Brandon Ross : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Michael Rapino : Historically, Brandon, there was a division on what the artist was charging to the consumer and then what were the added revenue streams or fees that were going to be added on top of that. And it\u2019s kind of in search state historically. But now, as you know, we've said it many times, the artist takes most of that ticket fee base. So the way that the venue, the promoter or the ticketing company earn their revenue fees is through that extra fee. You're right we would love to more just to make it all in pricing. So the consumer is very clear from the beginning that to go see the true cost to the show isn't $25, it's $50 because that's how all of the participants need to be participate for that show to happen. Now tomorrow, if someone said, you know what, those $25 fees, you shouldn't have them. Well, then the van you would say, okay, artist, the rent isn't $50,000 anymore, it's $100,000. And the fees would add up and then all of a sudden, that ticket price wouldn't be $25, it would be $50 on a value. So it is inefficient. That's why we're a big proponent of all-in pricing and all our pricing at the beginning of the process, which you don't see right now on most companies other than ours. So we believe that we all want to know what is the true cost to see the show when I start shopping. We wish that would be mandated tomorrow across the board that would relieve a lot of the stress, the consumer's perception that there's this magical extra fee added on that is not kind of part of the overall show cost. Brandon Ross : Got it. Thanks for the explanation. Michael Rapino : And to your point on Live Nation owned and operated, just to hammer the point home to your point is right. If tomorrow, someone said, you know you can't charge 20% service fees on your amphitheater, you have to be $10, well, then the $75,000 house not rent that we charge Argus, would be $100,000, right? So we couldn't \u2013 we wouldn't absorb the cost. We still have to pay staff capital, run the building so we have to find the revenue in the other means. So the true cost of going to a show and making the show happen isn't the full price all in. We just need to now market that upfront better. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with J.P. Morgan. David Karnovsky : Hi. Thank you. Michael, I think over the years we've become accustomed to seeing some level of criticism against Live Nation or Ticketmaster from politicians, trade press, social media that certainly elevated lately though. So I wanted to ask what actions were you thinking about taking to be more proactive in managing the public perception or your relationship with lawmakers that could maybe help limit what's become a periodic concern for investors. Michael Rapino : Yes, it's a great question. First, I want to kind of look at where the drama that gets created, if you kind of zoom out, we did 550 million tickets last year, about 540 million of those were happy customers that were seamlessly delivered. About 10 million of those are five tours historically a year, have this incredible demand with supply demand is out of whack and it creates lots of tension and unhappy customers. And that's kind of always kind of been the historic challenge in the business. At Live Nation Ticketmaster, historically we've really been a B2B business. Our Ticketmaster job is to service the venue and our concert job is to service the artist. And we've done a fabulous job building those businesses and having very, very happy customers. And part of that proposition historically has been to take a bit of the heat at the front end. When the ticket prices are high, when the service fees are high, if the demand supplies out of whack, Ticketmaster has historically been the one that's taken the punch or the ticket seller in general, if you look at all ticket companies, all their NPL scores are all kind of the same. There's only two customers as Fred Rosen famously said, the one that got the ticket is happy and all the ones that didn't are pissed off, right? So you never always \u2013 you can never kind of make \u2013 this is an industry where there's just not enough inventory to make everyone happy. And we've lived that historically. But absolutely, we've got to now start adjusting on our B2C side. We've got to get much more lean forward on our government relations and our PR side. We've historically not had a big incentive to kind of shout out loud that venues are charging high service fees or artist costs are expensive that hasn't been a big business incentive to date. But I think now education is paramount. We've got to now go out and do a much better job. So the policymakers, some consumers understand how the business does operate and how we all have a hand on the wheel, and we've got to all probably do a better job going forward. One of the real challenges that I think has kind of highlighted this this core problem, right? For 40 years, there's always been a show that with not enough tickets and a fan was unhappy. Obviously, in the last while, I think which kind of set the nuclear chaos on this on sale is the secondary business. You think of what happens on those four or five big demand tours a year, that passionate fan, which is the hallmark of our business, thank god, fans are passionate. They're more passionate about the artist's relationship than they are sports or anything else. They're committed, and they want to see that artist at all costs. Now what's happening is you announce an on sale. I think Irving said it famously yesterday. We haven't announced the U2 on sale yet. We haven't announced when the dates will play. But secondary sites have U2 dates up with tickets on sale. So the consumer on these high demand on sales has really over the last couple of years, started to get pissed off and doesn't understand the process. Why are there so many tickets on spec selling sites? Why is 10 o'clock if I didn't get a ticket, are there five pages of scalper sites selling tickets for 5 times to face value. Ticketmaster, you must have given them tickets. This must \u2013 this doesn't seem fair. And that's kind of the digital ticket going online to add then a SeatGeek, StubHub, Vivid, the big scalpers with all of their ways of getting tickets before, after that's really highlighted, right? That's really become a new thing over the last few years that the consumers could see now online. They don't understand why they couldn't get a ticket and why there's so many tickets on secondary. So I think that's the part that we've got to now really lean in on that. We did that today with the Fair Act. I would tell you, yesterday, sitting at the industry conference at Polestar, if any of you want to hear the panel between Irvin, Garth Brooks, Jim Dolan and the DOJ ex-employee. I think it was fabulous because I think it really shows a united music industry in that conference yesterday was venue, promoters, managers, agents and artists. And I would say it was the most excited and most united I've ever seen them in the sense of we've got to now stand up as an industry. Artists historically have not been great at lobbying together and really the only lobbyists that exists is the Ticket Broker Association, they've done a good job. But I would say yesterday, that room was lit up that the artist and fan relationship and that books a moment when he sat out there and said, \"When I want to charge a certain price for a ticket, I don't want someone in the middle making money off my IP, I want to deliver that ticket to my fan at my price\". So I think we've been too passive in our approach on how we need to educate and act. This week was the start of where we're going to start moving. You're going to see us lean forward a lot more on education reform. And then ultimately, the part that matters the most is just being better at our products. We still are the best at the game right now. We're the only ones that have developed Verified Fan products to try to stock the secondary box. We're going to get better and better at that. We're going to be more transparent. We're going to do some new products on the Live Nation venue side that will lead the industry. So I think you'll see this year a lot more action from our side pushing back, leaning forward and ultimately better products with the artist. But I would tell you if there's one place you want to be standing right now is where we are. We work for the artist, they're very united behind us. We're doing a fabulous job for them. Scalpers have done a great job of hijacking the narrative. Obviously, when [indiscernible] start witness as the CEO of SeatGeek, we\u2019ve not done a good job. We're going to move forward this year much more aggressive telling the artist side of the story. I think FAIR Act today is a good start at that. David Karnovsky : Okay. And then for Joe, just on the quarter, the sponsorship AOI margin was a little lower than we normally see. I think there were some festivals and amp shows that had got scheduled later. So wondering if there was a mix factor there. And then just free cash flow conversion for the year, I think it was like 10% higher than you had expected? Wondering if you could just walk through the drivers of that and how sustainable that might be? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think, obviously we finished up a fantastic year. As I've told you guys in the past, I don't overly read too much in this quarter specific comparisons. You've got a lot of moving pieces. We obviously had some changes in the business with the addition of OCESA, a lot of impact last year. Timing of APAC closed most of the year. Europe only opened in the second half. So it was really just some timing shifts, nothing to read particularly into it or to read as a go-forward indication on the margin side. And then as you said, yes, our free cash flow came in very strong as the conversion to AOI. I think a little higher than expected, in part, just the overall AOI level, gave us some leverage on that. And then just some of the below the line pieces were a bit lower than what we expected. So I think we outperformed last year on that free cash flow conversion. David Karnovsky : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Laszczyk : Hey. Great, thank you. Maybe on the demand front for Michael. Thanks for the commentary on ticket sales being up 20% year-over-year on a global basis so far this year. I was hoping you could maybe expand on that a little bit by talking more about what you're seeing in demand so far through February, particularly in markets that were opened this time last year, I think like the U.S., Canada and maybe parts of Europe? As consumer pricing trends remain stable versus what you saw last year as growth accelerated or decelerated, especially now lapping some of the reopening benefits that we saw in 2022? Michael Rapino : So thanks Stephen. Joe Berchtold : I'll start. Michael Rapino : Go ahead Joe. Joe Berchtold : I'll just start with some of the numbers and then Michael can fill in with some color. So as Michael said, we're up 20% this year relative to where we were at this point last year. That's even with last year having the benefit of all those rescheduled shows, which totaled around 20 million fans. About 20 million fans got rescheduled. We think half of those would have happened last year anyway, but that means that 20% growth comp is against an inflated number, if you will. So the actual growth even stronger than that. As we noted in the release \u2013 within that international is up around 25%, which would mean that North America is still up high teens. So very good growth. If you look just at the ticket sales sold in January through mid-February this year on a global basis, we've sold roughly twice the number of tickets as we sold last year. So even looking at the most recent activity continues to be very robust globally. Michael Rapino : Yes. And my commentary is similar. We are just amazed at the resilience of the customer this year. I think we all lived the November air pocket thesis and everyone's view on was 2022 an exception to the rule. Could we keep growing? Where was the customer? Was it just a bubble? We see nothing but strong growth demand everywhere in the world right now. We're up right now with stadiums in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, all of our festivals are outperforming last year around the world. Our clubs and theaters are doing well. Our on-site spend in most of those clubs and theaters we see tracking in the right direction. We'd always \u2013 in this business, you always worry about the first \u2013 the superstars are going to sell out, and then how is the rest of the business do? That's kind of the meeting the potatoes of our business. How the amphitheater shows? How is all the middle stuff going to do? And we're just seeing incredible strength right now across the board on our festivals, our big festivals or niche festivals, our theaters, clubs, we think this is going to be a continual buyer, consumers, as we said. Still look at concerts, let's zoom out again as we always do, let's forget about the 3% of shows that are going to consume political tweaks. 97% of that shows are very affordable for consumers. We're still incredibly affordable option for fans to go have a memorable night out, much more affordable than concerts. I said to Joe earlier, we absolutely have done a bad job on PR because the Super Bowl, it was a badge of honor that tickets were $5,000 or $6,000 each, and most people couldn't attain it. But concerts are still incredibly cheap overall experience versus a best ball game, a dinner, a night out or a theme park. So we think that plays in. We haven't seen any pullback. We've seen more demand top to bottom on a global basis. We think that will rise through this year. Stephen Laszczyk : Great. And then maybe one more on regulation for Joe. You recently made a pretty notable hire on the legal front. Could you talk a little bit about the rationale for that hire and maybe update us on where you stand in the process for any potential investigation with the DOJ? Joe Berchtold : So we're delighted. We hired Dan Wall, for those of you who didn't see it, joined us formally following his retirement from Latham at the end of January. This is actually a conversation Dan and I started in May of 2019 at BottleRock. So Dan was planning on retiring from Latham, found working with us to be an exciting, fun business. And we talked that in 2020, he was going to announced his retirement, retire at the end of 2020, come join us. Like so many other people's plans, those got upended. So he didn't end up retiring until January, but this has been something that's been in the works now for three years that Dan wanted to do. He'll be instrumental in terms of our ongoing discussion. He's been in non-stop dialogue with the DOJ. It seems like for the past 13 years. He understands exactly the questions they asked their motivations. He just put together an op-ed piece that everybody should certainly read that was in Polestar today laying out on a fact basis as opposed to so many analysts and pundits that people refer to making broad statements about the DOJ, their process, the consent decree, risks of us being broken up. I think he does a fantastic job of laying out in very specific detail why so many of those beliefs are unfounded and I think creates a little higher requirement for people that are going to talk that way to need to disprove what he lays out there as opposed to generally speculating. Stephen Laszczyk : Okay. Thank you for that. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Glagola : Yes. Thank you. Building off what you said earlier, Michael, about one of your main ticketing competitors testifying against you. Just in light of the Fair Ticketing Act, do you think there's any political will in United States to allow for primary ticketing players like Live Nation to help artists utilize their digital ticketing technology to impose controls on the resale of ticket? Michael Rapino : Well, I believe that the artist has the best shot when they unite around their IP. I don't think \u2013 there is \u2013 the U.S. is probably about the only country in the world that doesn't have some level of regulation. I mean most other countries walk up and said, \"Geez, if the artist wants to charge $300 an underpriced product for the fan to get a cheaper ticket why would a middleman be able to make $1,000. It doesn't seem logical, right? So most IP, if you look at the artist, you wouldn't be able to look, think about how much work Netflix is doing on password sharing just to save $7.99. So I think there's a lot of pent-up artists who are underpriced their product every day. I mean we're pretty much the only product in the world that's worth more of the second it's sold. I think they've done that for the betterment of their fan base. And like everyone else, they've seen now the sunlight online of the abuse that's been taken on their IP. So I like our position. I like stand up with the artist. I think the artists, Irving, you saw it yesterday with Garth. I do believe that the artist will have more control of their ticket like the PROJAM [ph] model they should. That doesn't mean that you are not going to transfer the tickets. We believe in tickets should have a fair exchange platform, and you should be able to exchange and sell tickets. And if an artist doesn't care about secondary then great, let the \u2013 the rush will then will move. If you do care and you want to limit it, you want to cap it at 30%, 20%. I just think that the artist since they're making the decision on how to underprice their product for the betterment of the fan should have a seat at saying, well, how does it go to market? Because we don't want the artist to continually say, well, I'm just going to charge $5,000 then, that's not better for the fan to charge market. So if they're going to charge under market, I believe that they should have a say in it. I do believe they'll be very persuasive over time with lawmakers when that story is presented. As you know, the secondary are running around trying to make sure that the second \u2013 tickets are freely transferred so they can sell them. I think that the good news in all of that's gone on in the last while, don't let a crisis go unused. I think that this has created a lot of great news as painful as it is for us some days. The bottle got on \u2013 the genie's out of the bottle. We were kind of suppressed on the back foot, not wanting to talk out loud too much about a lot of this business while we service our customers. I think the champagne bottle has been popped. I think artists I thought yesterday was very unique. I think you're going to see \u2013 we've been all sleeping, while the scalpers have done a fabulous job lobbying. I think they got woken up yesterday and recently. And I think the artist and the venue, remember have a big stake in this, right, especially sports. So I think the sports teams, sports leagues, content owners in general, like any other industry. May Kim was very clear yesterday. He talks a lot about the artist IP. We think that's a very valid position. We think that the artist or the content owner will be able to have more control on how and when they want to sell their tickets, and I think that's a big step forward. Stephen Glagola : Thanks Michael for that. And Joe, I just had one on your CapEx spend for 2023 to $450 million. So one-third of that on maintenance CapEx implies flat with 2019 and then two-thirds implies 50% growth, I think, above 2022 levels, 82% growth above 2019 levels. Can you just provide some more color here on what those investments are? Is this in the Venue Nation business? And then any color on the hurdle rate you guys factor into this capital spend would be appreciated? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Yes. A lot of the growth is certainly in the Venue Nation side. As you can imagine in 2020 and 2021, we had a substantial amount of deferred CapEx that we then do that the building is needed. Then in 2022, we were faced with a lot of supply chain constraints had to prioritize where to use the scarce resources that we were able to get. So that was a limiting factor. So there's some catch-up on the maintenance side of it. The return is really more of a rev gen side than a maintenance side. Most of the maintenance is required for continuing operation, health and safety issues. On the growth side, we have return requirements that are well above our cost of capital, haven't given specific ones, differs a bit by project, whether it's a brand-new project or it's just a \u2013 you're adding a new bar at a venue. So those are opportunities that we just think are continuing to present themselves as we expand the global footprint. Stephen Glagola : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Jason Bazinet : I just had a question on Concert's AOI per fan. I know you called out some of the headwinds, reopening costs, inflation for the venues you own and said it would get better. But can you just sort of frame what a reasonable AOI per fan is? I think it was $1.40 this year and maybe $2.50 or something back in 2019? Joe Berchtold : Yes. I don't think Concerts AOI per fan is a logical way to look at it, Jason. I think if you look at how we've talked about our business, we've talked about our business across the multiple pieces. So you have to look at it, what's the concerts plus sponsorship plus ticketing AOI per fan, which we've grown \u2013 and what we've said is that the concert business has been hit by some of these cost increases, supply chain constraints, increased costs on some of the inputs, but we've increased the overall profitability per fan both by executing on site with those fans coming to our venues, but then also by dramatically increasing our sponsorship per fan and by growing some of our ticketing revenue per fan, including the non-service fee side. So we look at it more holistically, recognizing there are going to be some puts and takes in a given year, certainly on the business. Jason Bazinet : Can I just follow up? Because it's... Michael Rapino : But also just I want to give some color there. Just to remind everyone, when we sat here a year ago, we didn't think we were going to be open in the summer. We had no staff. We ran 100 miles an hour to get open for May, hire 20,000 staff, every tour, concert couldn't find trust double cost for generators. I mean, we were running hard last year. Overpaying staff, suppliers, getting the show back together was tough last year. We still obviously delivered incredible numbers, but we're now back to that 2019 level of staff in place, costs have all come down, suppliers are all back in line, generators are normal cost. So we do obviously expect 2023 to be in terms of a cost basis back to a continual normal business. Jason Bazinet : Can I just ask 1 follow-up? Do you think the right way to look at it is that there's some sort of permanent shift in profit pools towards sponsorship and advertising and ticketing and away from concerts? In other words... Joe Berchtold : I think it's premature to say that. I mean let me give you another just piece on what hit us last year with concerts was we had those. I talked about the 20 million fans for shows that got rescheduled. Those are shows that went on sale in 2019 or early 2020, and we're priced at the price level for those shows back then. Fast forward a couple of years later, nobody was repricing the rescheduled shows, and yet the market particularly for the best tickets and moved up substantially. So in 2022, you were operating a pretty good chunk of your business with a 2019, 2020 revenue stream against the 2022 cost structure. That's not going to replicate itself. That was a one-time unusual event. So I think you got to take a beat, let this year play out before you draw in a conclusion off of a single data point. Jason Bazinet : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : And at this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the floor back over to the management team for closing remarks. Michael Rapino : Thank you, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Rapino : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 2023 is off to a tremendous start. For the first time in 3 years, all of our markets are fully open. In the common theme, we are seeing around the world that live experiences are a high priority for fans. In Q1, we delivered record results across all divisions as well as record support for artists. Ticket sales to attendance and on-site spend, every sign points to incredible demand for live events. In the first quarter, were 19 million fans attended our shows across 45 countries and we sold over 145 million tickets with record levels of activity across all markets. We delivered revenue of $3.1 billion and AOI of $320 million, up 73% and 53%, respectively, relative to Q1 last year. In general, all my comments will be relative to Q1 last year. This performance is indicative of a continued long-term growth and set the stage for a record 2023 as we are more positive than ever about artists touring bands attending concerts to see their favorite artists and our role helping make this happen. But as clear as we look at our results and operating metrics is that global demand for live events continues to reach new heights. Demand has been growing for a long time and is showing no signs of letting up. Talking to fans, they say that live experiences are the #1 leisure activity where they expect to spend more in the future. Naturally, this is leading to record levels of activity in both our concerts and ticketing business. First in concerts, we sold nearly 90 million tickets for shows this year, tracking more than 20% ahead of this point last year. These are early sales and have been driven by a record number of stadium shows and continued strong growth in arena tours. With many major tours from Beyonce, Drake to Bruce Springsteen, demand has been so strong that even when artists add a number of additional shows, they still aren't able to meet all of the fan demand. As a further initiative to make ticket affordable to all fans, we launched today our Summer Concert Week, with $25 tickets available to nearly 4,000 shows. When fans attend shows they continue spending to enhance the experience. While our key outdoor season has not yet started, early reads from U.S. and European indoor venues that we operate demonstrate further growth in average per fan revenue. As we provide more elevated hospitality options for fans, we have launched Vibee which hosts destination events centered around live music and launched this week with the sale of the U2 Sphere VIP packages selling out. We've also continued building our Venue Nation portfolio with new venues expected to host nearly 3 million fans at 1,000 shows this year, driving long-term growth and profitability across all our businesses. Our ticketing business benefits from the same structural tailwind as concerts with further growth driven by our success in adding new clients, notably in international markets. As a result, we sold 73 million fee-bearing tickets in the first quarter, up 40% and delivered $7.7 billion in fee-bearing GTV, up 60%. We are seeing growth in both volume and pricing across our global markets. This holds true across all event types from sports to concerts and from biggest superstars to new artists. Our brand partners recognize the passion for live music has never been greater, and the Live Nation provides a unique on-site and online platform to connect with fans in meaningful ways on a global scale. And in the first quarter, we continued adding partners for 2023 and beyond, including Google Pixel, PayPal and Levi's. With this, we have commitments for over 80% of our planned sponsorship of the year.  Equally important, fans are embracing the value brands can provide to the concert experience, with around 70% of live music goers agreeing that brands can enhance their time at the show. Our team is the best in the industry at working with brands to develop programs that deliver value to fans, which in turn grows our brand relationships and attracts new ones.  Our results for the first quarter demonstrate the success of our strategy and sets us up for strong growth in 2023. We expect to host a record number of fans this year, even against a 2022 comparison which benefited from rescheduled shows attended by 20 million fans. Ticketmaster should also deliver record activity, with around 600 million tickets managed globally this year. Our sponsorship business, even after incredible growth last year, looks to be on track for double-digit AOI growth again this year. As we then look to 2024 and beyond, we have all the necessary levers to build our flywheel globally and continue to compound AOI by double-digits for the foreseeable future. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more details. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Building on 2022, we started out this year with a record Q1, our highest first quarter revenue, AOI, fan count and ticket sales. All of our markets are fully open, selling tickets, hosting tours and connecting brands with fans. Our reported revenue of $3.1 billion for the quarter was $1.3 billion better than Q1 2022, an increase of 73%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $3.2 billion for the quarter. So there was roughly a 2% unfavorable impact due to the slight strengthening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the Canadian and Australian dollars. Given the limited FX impact on our numbers, the rest of my comments will just be a reported currency. Our reported AOI of $320 million for the quarter, was $111 million better than 2022, up 53% with an improvement of $65 million in ticketing, $50 million in concerts and $26 million in sponsorship. Over half of our AOI growth came from our Asia Pacific and Latin America markets where we are expanding our global touring activity and diversifying our historical seasonality. We converted roughly 59% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $190 million, which is significantly higher than our 43% conversion in Q1 2022. In our deferred revenue, a key leading indicator of growth ended this quarter at $4.4 billion, up 28% from this point last year.  Let me give a bit more color on each division. First, in concerts, we had the highest concert attendance ever for Q1 with 19.5 million fans attending our shows, up 79% compared to 2022 when we had approximately 11 million parents. Show count was 9,600 events, up 43% compared to 2022, with more fans per show due to a heavier mix of stadium and arena events and stronger than historical average attendance levels. As a result, our concerts revenue for the year grew by 89% to $2.3 billion, while we delivered $1 million in AOI, a $50 million improvement over Q1 2022. This is the beginning of what we see as a very solid year for our concert segment, including margin expansion relative to last year.  Looking a bit deeper at our fan metrics, we had strong growth across the board. Stadium attendance more than quadrupled to 3.3 million fans this quarter, up from 800,000 fans in 2022. This growth primarily came from our Asia Pacific and Latin American markets. Arena attendance was 6.7 million fans for the quarter, up $3 million or almost 80% from 2022, largely as a result of growth in Europe and Australia touring. Theater and fan club count was up 45%. And while it's not a large quarter for festivals, we did see festival fan count grow by 50% from our Mexico and Australia and New Zealand expansion. Overall, our international markets drove fan count growth, accounting for over 90% of our increase versus 2022. This was due in part to the closure still in effect in Q1 2022. That said, we expect continued strength across all global markets through 2023, along with some seasonal shift towards Q1 activity. Last year, we discussed the various cost headwinds at our operated venues and festivals. Thus far this year, cost pressures are declining and our operational cost per fan is down across our indoor buildings and we are forecasting that cost increases will remain below general inflation levels for our festivals and amphitheaters. As a result of these improved conditions, we expect overall profitability per fan will again increase this year as cost increases are more than mitigated by increasing average revenue per fan, pricing and on-site sponsorship. Next, in ticketing, where our numbers reflect growing fan demand for live experiences. In Q1 2023, we sold $72.6 million fee-bearing tickets, up 21 million tickets or 41% compared to 2022. Nearly 2/3 of the growth was driven by concert tickets as North America concert ticket sales increased by 35%, while international concert ticket sales increased even more by 65%. With this increased ticket volume GTV for the quarter was $7.7 billion, up 60% compared to 2022. At peak sales times during the quarter, Ticketmaster sold 15,000 tickets per minute in North America with more than 20 million fee-bearing tickets sold each month globally. And in Q1, over 99.9% of all TM transactions were processed without any issues. While secondary ticketing volume grew at a similar rate, ours continues to be largely a primary ticketing business with secondary ticketing accounting for only a mid-teens percent of our overall GTV. With these growing ticket sales, revenue for the quarter was $678 million and AOI was $271 million, delivering margin of 40%. It's hard to compare these margins to Q1 of last year, given the geographic mix shift and increased cost of ramping our staff back up over the course of last year. But these margins are ahead of our full year 2022 numbers, and we expect margins for the full year to continue being in the high 30s. On the pricing front, average ticket prices on primary tickets rose by 16% compared to Q1 of 2022, driven by fan demand for the best seats, particularly at concerts. Average secondary ticket prices remain close to double that of a primary ticket continuing to show the extent to which concerts and other live events remain price below market value. We also saw revenue from nonservice fees grow double digits as we further build ancillary revenue streams, including insurance, upgrades and other upsells. Lastly, so far this year, we have signed clients accounting for nearly 8 million net new tickets, up 15% compared to this point last year, positioning us for ongoing growth. Finally, in our sponsorship business, top line revenue improved by $54 million or 47% to $170 million in Q1. Our AOI for this high-margin business was $96 million, up 37%. Sponsorship's growth during the quarter was driven by the reopening of international markets that were closed in Q1 of last year, the increase in high-profile artists on sales that attract premium marketing partners and the expansion of our venue network. We had double-digit growth in both on-site and online sponsorship with on-site sponsorship representing most of our AOI growth year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, our international markets delivered 54% growth in the quarter while North America had 26% growth. Contributing to our sustained growth since last year has been our strategic sponsors to generate over $1 million of revenue in the year. Relative to Q1 of last year, our number of strategic sponsors grew by 15%, while the revenue from those partners rose by over 20%. These marketing partnerships now account for 85% of our total sponsorship revenues. Sponsorship margins were slightly lower than average during the quarter as we had higher variable expenses due to artist activation costs for A-list talent presales with tickets sold for these key sponsor programs 4x that of last year. As timing plays out, we anticipate that for the full year, variable expenses and margins will be in line with 2022.  A few other points on 2023. We continue to project that CapEx will be approximately $450 million this year, with 2/3 on revenue-generating projects, including new venue builds and renewals as well as other organic investments to support growth. The remaining 1/3 is on maintenance CapEx as we catch up on deferred 2020 and 2021 maintenance. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of available liquidity between free cash an untapped revolver capacity, giving us ample flexibility to continue investing in growth. We're comfortable with our leverage, particularly given the AOI growth ahead with approximately 87% of our debt at a fixed rate with an average cost of debt of roughly 4.7%. In addition, the majority of our debt is long dated and nothing is maturing within the next 18 months. The only notable change to our below-the-line guidance from Q1 is on accretion due largely to a set as impressive growth above previous projections, we estimate that accretion will be approximately 40% higher in 2022, and this should be factored into your EPS estimates. At this point, we don't expect any material FX impact on revenue or AOI for the year. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. David Karnovsky : Michael, Joe, we've seen a couple of bills introduced in Congress to address ticketing practices and contracts. So wondering first, how you think some of these items might impact your business, assuming they were fully enforced. And then just based on meetings you've had do you think these bills largely meet the primary concerns of lawmakers as you've come to understand. Michael Rapino : Yes, we're kind of watching what's going on. And we believe that through all of the noise, most people are ending up in the industry and politics at exactly where we are and the principles of what the FAIR Act is, so whether it's all in pricing, cleaning up deceptive practices and the secondary, giving artists more tools, those seem to be all the common themes coming out in all of these different bills, which we're fully supportive of. And having our own build of FAIR Act. We know Senator Cantwell and Cruz introduced theirs. [Neil] has got a bill coming in a senator Klobuchar and Cornyn. These are all in the same vein and the same thematic around helping the artist control their ticket and get them in the hands of the fans and be away of some of the practices and the secondary and the spec selling deceptive sites hopefully, better protection on BOTS, and we've always supported all in pricing. So this is not LN versus any of these. We are aligned to all of these bills. We think all of these bills, we've said continually for a long time, is better for our business because it helps us deliver a better on sale and fan experience. So right now, it's the Wild West, we're doing our best, but any bills and these natures that start putting some better regulations and controls around the experience is going to help our overall business. David Karnovsky : Okay. Then I was hoping you can expand a bit more on Vibee. Maybe can you frame the opportunity -- is this something you plan to build primarily for your major festivals and residencies, or is this -- is there a wider opportunity across your promotional footprint? And then just interested what drove the decision to kind of build this out internally versus maybe putting that out to bid for an events partner. Michael Rapino : Yes, we look at this segment overall. If you look at what we've been talking about on our Investor Day for the last few years, the premium business is a huge opportunity for us. I think I've said any time this is an industry that has done a great job of being scaled GA, but not done a great job of doing a premium experience for customers. The sports and new arenas and stadiums are doing a great job on that. But as an industry, like nation and the music industry has not done that. And we think there's a great opportunity overall to launch more products and services that can provide a better premium experience for the customer. So this would just be an extension and a continual strategy towards what we call the premium experience. We've got a company called VIP Nation. We'll do about 1,000 of those events this year. Those are based around the concert and the tour and going to a sound check or early experience or a meet and greet. So we've been the leader in that space and expanding that Ticketmaster's launch, Ticketmaster travel, looking at ways we can put both the ticket and an airline or hotel together and take advantage of that scale, and we've been testing that in the UK with great success. And Vibee is another product where we looked at Poland and we looked at on location and CID and Clint and others that were doing it. The difference is we have the scale, but we already have been doing it. We have the expertise. So we looked at our Insomniac team and built up [Body] launched it with the U2 experience sold out or close to $20 million in ticket sales around a high-end premium experience. So we have the in-house expertise, and this is another product in our ongoing strategy, whether it's clubs, premium memberships, premium clubs, subscriptions, all the ways we're going to continue to look to say how do we from the GA into a premium experience product. I know there's also the challenge of some of these other companies have is the expensive part about doing this is the right, and we don't have that problem. So when you're chasing the Olympic rights you're chasing a business for premium, it's a little harder unless you're in-house. So I'm sure our location does fabulous with their UFC experiences files, we don't have to pay rights. These are our rights. So we can do it in-house. We don't have to outsource it and split any of that upside with anyone else but our own businesses. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Brandon Ross : One on your fundamentals and then a follow-up to David's question on the sales and Congress. Actually, I'll start with that one. I think the Klobuchar bill very specifically attacks your venue exclusivity. Can you kind of just respond to that, Bill? And how important is the venue exclusivity model for you in North America? And then kind of on the fundamentals, last year was obviously a pretty depressed year in terms of constant margins. I know you take the word margins, Joe, but we'll go with it anyway. Is -- should we see a real bounce back in that and continuing type of from 2030 and beyond into future years. Joe Berchtold : First of all, on the exclusivity point, I think first point I should make is, congratulations on the birth of your daughter. Glad to hear, everybody is doing well. But to the exclusivity point, I always start with, these are the venues rights. And the venues have been figuring out over time, how do they best monetize certain rights they have. What they have determined is the best way to monetize those rights in the U.S. is by actioning them off for exclusivity. So I think it's, frankly, primarily were there to be any changes in exclusivity it's venues that would be hurt the most because they would lose the ability to fully maximize their rights. We're very confident with the quality of our systems, its ability to handle on sales in a way that no other system can do has been shown both by the clients that we've been adding as well as you've seen in the press issues that other systems have with very modest on sales. So we're very confident in our ability to deliver. I think it's uncertain any bill, in today's Congress, not just this one, but any bill that doesn't have bipartisan support out of the gate as its challenges. But more fundamentally, I think that you'd see the venues respond to that and probably push back because they would be hurt a lot more than we would. In terms of the performance of the business, I tried to give a lot of details in there. I think that, as you know, first of all, we look more at the cash profitability of the business, where that is, how that's operating on a basis, which, as I said, we expect to continue to grow this year. I also noted, I think, in the concert side, the last year was a bottom tick in terms of our margins. We expect it to be coming back this year. We don't assess over margins because, for instance, this year, we expect to be having a great stadium and arena year, as you could tell by the numbers we already gave for that's inherently going to be a lower-margin business than one of our amputate customers. We're still going to pursue that business, still a great business, but it impacts technically the margin, while generating cash profitability. So I think that we're on an upward trajectory. I think '23 is going to be great. And every very early sign we have for '24 is continued success. Brandon Ross : Just one quick follow-up to that comment. I think there's concern about lapping the supply side for next year. Do you feel good the supply side coming out of the '22 and '23. I know you get asked this question every year as things grow. But do you feel confident with what you're seeing so far? That\u2019s all. Michael Rapino : Yes. Yes. We -- as you know, yes, we live this in the -- I think the fall was all about the air pocket and would there be enough shows in '23. So hopefully, we put that to bed. We don't think this has anything to do with pent-up demand or COVID rescheduling. That stuff has long been clushed out in '22. This is all about regular business back to business. And I think we're thrilled that we're sitting here looking of a comparable last year but basically had almost 1.5 years combined into a year because of all those rescheduled shows at 20 million. To be sitting here today above and beyond last year's numbers, shows the global strength of the business, and it also shows the global strength of the business from the amphitheater and the stadium to the club to the festival. We're looking at all territories around the world. Firing on all cylinders. We're looking at the kind of talent you see on the road right now. This isn't just The Rolling Stones, right? The question we always have to fight off, six of the top 10 artists were younger artists. You look at Lollapalooza Coachella with Bad Bunny, Carol G, Rosalina, the BLACKPINK, the BTSs, Billie Eilish. I mean there's just a host of great new talent every year coming up, filling the pipe that we didn't know Luke Combs was going to be selling stadiums out this year, two years ago. We had no idea Bad Bunny was going to be the largest selling artists last year. So we just continue to see the supply/demand, we think, for the future, is really, really strong. There's more and more artists sitting in the studio right now on TikTok. The greater economy is alive and low and they all want to be the next bad money. And we said it before, we're also seeing this encouraging new supply strategy where for many years, it was all about a U.S. or UK-based artists that filled the charts and fill the stadium. And most other talent was domestic. It might have been big in Canada, it might have been big in area, but it didn't travel. This is the real breakout year where the world and the consumer are truly global. And now you can see artists coming from Latin America and Korea and becoming global superstars. That didn't happen for the last 30 years. It was a very top U.S. or UK controlled industry. So we think that alone gives the next kick to the supply chain for the next 10 years of young talent from -- it will be from India, South Africa, it's going to be everywhere overnight finding their way to TikTok and Spotify and other places to become these global stars that are still in arenas and stadiums out in their markets. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Laszczyk : Maybe for Michael, on underlying contract demand, setting aside the stadium and arena tours for the moment. Can you maybe talk about how demand for the average or even smaller amphitheater or club show is trending compared to what we saw for those types of shows last year? I think there's some concern that maybe the top shows are performing well this year, but it's perhaps coming at the expense of the smaller ones. So just love to hear your thoughts on how those smaller and average size shows are performing? Joe Berchtold : Yes, Stephen, Yes. Just to give you the feel on that, we don't have a lot of amphitheaters yet just in the first quarter. But if you look at our theaters and clubs, which tend to be pretty strong at this point of the year, they're tracking around 8% ahead in terms of average attendance per show. We're doing that with also increased pricing, lower cost structure on a per fan basis. So those shows are performing very well for us. Michael Rapino : And just to jump on Joe there. Unlike the movie theater kind of model, we're not a hit-driven industry, right, where we are a truly scaled business. And you're right, we looked at -- the Beyonces of the world are always going to do the great numbers. But when you're sitting here today, looking at even our festivals, the Lollapaloozas are the easy ones, but we have over 200 festivals, Bonnaroos to one-day festivals in smaller markets to our U.S. and international businesses. And all of it seems to be doing really, really well. So whether it's a middle of a road festival in a smaller market, whether it's a club act. At all levels, there seems to be incredible demand and on a global basis. So we haven't seen just the top stuff selling and they're not coming to the other stuff. The demand seems to be uniformed from clubs to stadiums from Pittsburgh to Milan. Stephen Laszczyk : Great. And then maybe just one on the venues business. You called out in the press release, I think you expect to host 3 million incremental fans at new Live Nation venues this year. I'm curious, maybe for Joe, if you look at ambitions on the venue side, how many incremental fans or shows you think you can add to the flywheel over the next couple of years, maybe just given how the venue pipeline stands today? Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think this year would be typical in what we would hope to add in the low millions per year from our own venues with a mix of some new amphitheaters, new arenas at the larger end, while continuing to build out the club and theater portfolio. So it continues to be a meaningful part of it and more robust. As I said earlier, you can scale the stadiums and arenas faster. But over time, we've learned we can deliver a very accretive return for our shareholders by operating it and being able to count the beer money and the sponsorship money as well. Michael Rapino : And I think we laid that out in our November Investor Day, probably on a more macro level. We wanted to remind investors, we've been doing this for a long time. We have a large venue portfolio we don't see that strategy changing. It's not incrementally different than it's been year after year. We bolt on and continue to look around the world at opportunist markets where there's a great return, and we keep adding a venue club theater an arena, if we can find the right market like Austin, where it's a big return. So we'll continue that strategy over time. And I think we laid out in November cleaner in terms of how many and what numbers we look to subscribe to over time. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet : I just had a question about your cash balance, seems like used to run, I don't know, $0.5 billion or something and it's been 4x that or something over the last year. Do you just think that in the spirit of being cautious that it just makes sense to have more cash on hand? Or do you think there's some flexibility to deploy it in one way or another? Joe Berchtold : No, I think just to make sure you have the cash numbers right, I think those cash numbers included untapped revolver capacity, right? So from that metric, it's probably not quite that extreme, but we continue to see a very strong set of opportunities to continue growing the business. We just talked about the venue business, which we've been in, but we think on a global basis has a lot of great opportunities to continue to build out the portfolio. And we think even within our existing portfolio, there's a lot of things that we can do to enhance the fan experience as Michael was talking about. So at the moment, we're maybe being a little conservative coming out of COVID, but looking to continue to grow the business, and we'll continue to assess it and see what the right options are. Jason Bazinet : Can I just ask one follow-up. One of the more interesting things to me, looking at your stock price is, it seems so depressed relative to the fundamentals you guys have been putting up for the last year or so part of the DOJ related part of it fears of sort of of pent-up demand. But I was just surprised that you guys didn't sort of take advantage of that seeming disconnect with share repurchases. Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think the flip side of -- share repurchases tactically is one thing. I think we've also seen a lot of companies out there that embark on share repurchases and the market takes that as a signal that they are out of growth ideas. And I think that we have such a robust set of growth ideas that we wouldn't want that to be misunderstood. Secondly, when you invest in growth, you deliver compounded returns over time, you can maybe get an attractive return from a stock if you think there's a dislocation but you lose out on the accretive compounding impact that you can have by investing in these growth opportunities. As I said, I think we'll continue to look at all the options as we move forward. But I think in the immediacy of coming out of it, that's been our thought process. . Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with TD Cowen. Stephen Glagola : Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael and Joe. Just -- I had two specific questions around the proposed legislation and how that's going to potentially could potentially impact your business. So one on prohibition of ticket and exclusivity with venues. Can you just provide like, I guess, your color on the competitive position of Ticketmaster in international markets that you operate on an allocation or nonexclusive model, just to kind of glean insights on how the U.S. could be from that, like how renewals are trending there and new business there, one? And then two, on this Junk Fee Protection Act, I believe there's a provision that the FTC can determine if mandatory ticketing fees are excessive. So I just wanted to know how would fee caps impact your service fee revenue. Would that impact more than what the venue collects or what the primary ticketing service collects as well? Michael Rapino : I think you need to go to some of the [Bob Roux] interview. It will help you. The venue drivers, as Joe said, this is the venue business. I know everyone wants to subscribe at the end demand, most of the service fee and kind of do the auction for the ticket. So Again, we think that the venue that's built in the $1 billion arena or the multibillion dollar stadium in that market, I think he's going to continually be pretty strong and vocal about his rights and returns on what companies he can hire exclusively or not to service his business, so whether it's Microsoft or CRM or Salesforce or Ticketmaster. I think they're going to look at all their options for their best return for their business. So we look at that from that perspective.  We look at Europe just because we've always thrown out really lightly that international as an allocation in the U.S. is here. Just kind of for the trend, International is moving more towards an exclusive model than away from it as new buildings are being built over there and you're building your arena, which really had been underdeveloped. It was mostly a soccer business or football. But as the new buildings are getting built, they are looking over here and realizing that this is another revenue stream that they should be leveraging. So I look at international probably moving closer to the U.S. model in the U.S. model moving to the international model because I think they're now realizing that they've been under valuing their exclusive ticketing rights for their venues. Now we do really well over there because we always will do well in an open market with the best technology. We sell more tickets than the competitor. So if you're an open allocated market and you're going to allocate to us and others, we're going to do really, really well because we're going to be the 1 that probably sells the most tickets for you, so you'll end up allocating more to us. But we don't think that model probably ends up here, more driven by the venue agenda than the ticketing agenda. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Thanks for including covered a lot, but I was hoping you could just talk about the secondary ticketing market, which seems to be an area of growth for new smaller entities, other approaches, technologies, et cetera. And I know you've talked about in the past how what their impact is on the market. What's new with respect to that? What can you do about it to protect yourselves better? And I'd just love an update there, please, if you could. Michael Rapino : I'll jump and then Joe will -- I just want to remind what we said earlier, of all the legislative noise, we've been swirling around for 6 months. The common theme in all of this legislation that you're seeing come forward is around limiting and putting some handcuffs around the scalper and the business. So we do see a lot of this legislation moving forward is going to help the primary ticket, the content holder, do a better job on that front. And it will be harder for the scalper or the BOT, deceptive website, spec selling, a lot of practices, drip selling, et cetera. So we do think that overall, this market right now, legislatively, is moving against the secondary business in general, not going to ban it, not going to cap it, but some of the cleanup legislation does help primary hertz secondary. That's a big move that hasn't happened in the last 10, 15 years. Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think the other piece is you have to remember that secondary for sports is very different than secondary in concert. Secondary and sports is often used as a distribution platform where you sell the season and ticket to the scalpers, they disaggregate it and they're performing a function for the sports teams of guaranteeing them some upfront funding that has value to the teams, the value to the fans. You don't have that in concerts. The concerts, the issue is that they're using illegal and deceptive practices to get tickets with the sole objective of increasing the price and selling them to the fans. So I think what you're seeing is because the artists don't have the same sort of collective central power that a league does today, they can set up an NFL ticket exchange, you need to give the power back to the artists. So it's very clear that they can be the decision-maker. And then it becomes the onus of the secondary players to figure out how they're adding value. Like any other business today, you have to survive and adapt and grow because you're adding value to others in your ecosystem. That hasn't been what -- how the scalpers have done it in music over the past several years, and it's finally gotten another point where you're getting the put back now from the artists, and that's being fully understood by our politicians. David Katz : Thank you. And to say next quarter would be understating beating by $100 million. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Benjamin Swinburne : Two questions. Michael, you also mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks that the secondary prices are running about 2x primary. Last year, I think it was last year, sort of that Bruce Springsteen moment about market pricing expectations that more artists would embrace that. I was wondering if you could just sort of update us today on sort of the trend in market pricing on primary and sort of pricing back house, front of house the right way and where you feel the industry is and the business is today? And then secondly, you guys are always thinking pretty far ahead around technology. What are your thoughts on AI as an opportunity for Live Nation? Just broadly, it's obviously a huge topic these days. So would love to hear what you think. Michael Rapino : Perfect. On pricing, I think we've been saying it for the last few years, the great transparency and sunlight of secondary has really helped the artists and the management team look at their pricing models. Historically, it was a fairly static pricing, three different maybe price points, same price points all across the country. It matter if there was a Friday in New York or Tuesday in Pittsburgh. So the business has gotten really, really sophisticated with our PriceMaster or different dynamic models that artists can now use. So we see that there's still years away between where the artist markets, the price and what the market is willing to pay. The artist is one of the few products in the world that's worth more than it's sold, but they do that for their brand and accessibility. And I think that will continue. But I do think we've seen the artists looking at their ticket price and the whole manifest and how do we bring the prices down in the back, bring the prices up in the front, so we can sell out and make sure everyone gets a ticket at an affordable price, but let's not let secondary runway of the front row. So we think that we're still dramatically underpriced versus demand, and you see that every day on the secondary. And we think that's probably going to live for the next 5 to 10 years as the artist moves closer to market, probably never gets to market. But between here and where they feel comfortable, we think there's years of upside that they'll continue to look at. AI, Joe, you can talk about the TM. Joe Berchtold : Yes. Yes. I think on AI, just to be clear, I think it's all upside for us. There's no concern that somehow AI can never replace the live experience. For us, it's a -- I consider it an infrastructure tool for both efficiency and effectiveness. So if you think about using AI on recommendations, much better marketing much better individual recommendation in terms of making you aware of shows that you might want to go to. Clearly, we're using machine learning now to help inform models on suggesting pricing that we were just talking about. AI is just the same thing to the next level of data input through that machine learning process. It will help us automate a lot of tools, the event creation process that takes place at every venue being able to use much better data, machine learning, whatever what's going on elsewhere in the PM system will make that more efficient. All the chatbots that you have today, those will go to a whole another level of effectiveness, working with fans and be at a much lower cost than you have today. And then as we're fighting bots using AI to continue in our battles, to make sure we know who's a person or try to know who's a person, Brit, who's not. So it kind of runs throughout all of our infrastructure. It's a lot of places that we're using machine learning today AI is really that to the next level. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : I just wanted to ask a question on kind of the pace of growth. I mean when we look at deferred revenue, I think it's up almost 30%. You talked about the concert ticket sales at this point, up 20%. Any help to you could give us just on if you think that type of pace of growth can be sustained this year. I think the message is clear, it's going to be a strong year, but would just love to get a little color and flavor about kind of the speed of what you could grow this year. Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think that you generally start the year coming out of the gate fastest when you're led by stadiums and arenas. So that -- those are the shows that we've long talked about put on sale earliest relative to the show date. So you've got great scalability in the stadiums, which are seeing 4x the level of activity, good scalability in your arenas. So that's driving your huge increase in attendance, strong increase in ticket sales at $90 million in your deferred revenue. I think as you get into more of the shows that take place in our buildings, across the festivals, amphitheaters to some extent a you generally have a lower level of scalability. You still have very solid growth, but not the same level as you have with your stadiums and arenas. So I don't think we're ready to try to declare an exact number, but I think we recognize the level you have in Q1 is probably going to be the high point of the year. . Michael Rapino : And I think -- sorry, I just want to jump on there for one second, John. And just what's more important to us is just helping both sides realize what's the future in '24 on. So we went through -- obviously, COVID was down and last year was an extraordinary year. The Hut does '23 and '24 start to look. And we're very optimistic. We look at this year as being a very strong year coming off what people probably thought we couldn't be last year. We think '24 into forward, you kind of look at what we historically have delivered. We've been a high single industry growth business and a high single-digit revenue AOI business year after year for many years. And we look at going forward, we think we're back to being a great strong growth business year-over-year off this foundation of business. So we think the industry is back bigger than ever. And we think there's years of industry growth we've shown you when the industry grows, we tend to do a rise with that tide and capture as much as industry growth or we tend to do a couple of points better. So industry has been growing about 8% or 9% a year. We tend to beat it. We look at this as a long-term continual growth story again. John Healy : Great. And then just a big picture question I wanted to ask. I think you called out APAC and Latin America is fueling some growth at the start of the year. Just as you think about those businesses long term, is it safe to say that as they become a bigger piece of the pie, the margin level of the business should rise. Are those -- I always thought those businesses had potential to be maybe higher margin than the U.S. market, but was just kind of curious how thinking about those as they sit today. Joe Berchtold : Yes. I don't think we start with thinking about it as margin. We think about them as being massive growth potential markets, probably the least developed of our major markets. So having great growth opportunity to continue to drive more fans, and more obviously, highly profitable fans. As we establish more venues in those markets, I am sure that you can get some attractive margin operability as you operate, but I think more than starting with any margin focus we're looking at just what's the volume of fans and what's the overall concerts, ticketing, sponsorship, profitability, we can drive off that. Operator : At this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Now I would like to turn the floor back over to Michael Rapino for any closing comments. Michael Rapino : Appreciate everyone. Thank you. We'll talk to you in the summer. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining us today from Live Nation, our President and CEO; Michael Rapino, President and CFO, Joe Berchtold, and Head of Investor Relations, Amy Yong. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Berchtold. Thank you. Mr. Berchtold, you may begin your conference. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, everyone, for joining us. As I think you noticed from our earnings release this time based on some feedback that we've gotten on our release and the materials in general. We've switched it up this time to get a little more comprehensive and data-driven in terms of numbers and the facts. So you see an earnings release that we reduced the narrative and increase, if I give you on a more structured basis all the key numbers and then also put a trending schedule that I think there was a link to you can get as a PDF or an Excel file, so you can track this quarter's numbers relative to history to make some of it easier. So I'll turn it over to Amy to give you a quick reminders, and then Michael and I will go straight into taking questions that folks have. Amy? Amy Yong : Thanks, Joe. We would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to our SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. We will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, we have provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release issued earlier today. The release reconciliation can be found under the Financial Information section on our website. And with that, we are now ready to take questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon Ross : I think investor concern now, if you were to pull the buy side is that with the past few years coming out of COVID being so strong, you're going to have trouble growing next year. And I think the Street is only at mid- to high single-digit growth. I guess, this is a good problem to have, but you said there are positive indications for '24, and wanted to see if you can kind of break that down into domestic and international. So on the domestic side, what are the positive indications that you're seeing besides this very early pipeline? Will supply match what we've seen in the past couple of years. And then on international, obviously, LatAm has been a huge tailwind post-acquisition. You've seen some other green shoots in Asia and parts of Europe. Should we expect continued growth in those markets or just more M&A on top? Joe Berchtold : So Brandon, thanks. This is Joe. For starters, as I think you probably noticed we put in the release that at this point, our confirmed shows and shows that we have offers in on our arenas, amphitheaters, stadium shows is up relative to where we are at this point last year coming into '23. So we're seeing continued growth in the show count, which should lead to continued growth in attendance. As you know, our formula is to drive that growth in attendance and from there, accelerate the AOI levels even higher with increasing per fan profitability on-site, increasing sponsorship, increasing our ticketing business. So I think we're set up for a very strong continued growth into 2024 across the board. And a lot of that activity, these are going to be the shows that have the longest lead time on. So a lot of these are going to be global in nature, cutting across both North America and international. As you noted and as I think much of the release lays out, this has been a tremendous quarter for growth in international markets up, I think it was 46% fan growth so far this year, which given that we were closed part of last year, we expected to see very strong growth. But we still think we're in the early innings. If you take Latin America, we're up about 35% this year so far year-to-date with roughly 10 million fans. But we think we're still in the early innings in South America. We launched the Town festival already sold 400,000 tickets on our way to probably 500,000 tickets, which is unheard of for a festival in its first year. So as we continue to layer on our promoting business bringing in our sponsorship business, bringing in our ticketing business throughout Latin America. That just continues to drive it forward. In North America, again, a very good year this year, and we're seeing the sort of growth that we think is possible ongoing year-to-date, up 8% in North America with the fan count expect that to be double-digit fan growth in Q3, probably verging on double-digit fan growth for the full year in North America as we're seeing top to bottom. We're seeing strong growth in theaters and clubs. Our amphitheaters are doing great, substantially up in number of fans attending per show and the high-end stadiums are doing very well. I've seen some things talking about is the middle, how is the low end demand across all of those continues to be very strong. Michael Rapino : And I'll just jump in. And Brandon, just to reiterate the pipe, right? The most important thing for us is just how does the pipe look for next year. As you know, a year ago, we sat here, and I think everyone thought '22 was the record year, and we were headed into an air pocket, and we've blown the doors off in '23. I would just step back. We believe for the next multiple years that this industry, in general, is going to have a growth surge on a global basis. We've talked to all these factors before, international, global artists, consumers. There's a whole bunch of great articles written on why there's a boom happened in a live business on a long-term basis. So we don't think this is just any COVID catch-up. We think that this is going to be the time we're live on a global basis is going to have an incredible growth run for years to come. We obviously benefit from that any time the market gets this level of growth because we'll capture that growth also. So we're looking next year, we're seeing top to bottom, as Joe said, incredible pipe of artists that will be filling all of the different venue types and markets across the world. So we think we're heading to a very, very strong 24, 25 onward, a combination of the market is going to grow, the consumer demand is growing and our ongoing bolt-on acquisitions, venues, new market entries compounded on top of our organic growth is going to give us this continual 1, 2 punch of growth for the next multiple years. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Laszczyk : Just maybe on the outlook for consumer spending. There's been a lot made over the last couple of months about the impact of student loan payments starting up in the fall. Maybe for Joe, if you could just remind us what percentage of the comps are going based you think might be skewed toward this cohort? And then maybe more broadly discuss how you're thinking about the risk that consumer spending pulls back maybe into the back half of the year or next year? Are there any parts of your business that you think are more or less exposed and perhaps festivals, and just would be curious if you could dive a little bit more deeply into the demands under the equation. Joe Berchtold : Sure, Stephen. Thanks. I think first, just for context, I think it's important to remember a relative scale. So if you look at consumer spend, discretionary spend on goods versus experiences. As we know, it was in the high 60s in experience. I mean this is a Goldman report that talks about this. pre-pandemic and then how that has dropped and it hasn't yet caught up. So our analysis shows that the tailwind impact from getting experiences back as a portion of discretionary spend is about 10x the impact of any potential headwind coming from the student loan payments needing to get made. So we think that the tailwinds on that specific macro factor as far outweighs any headwinds. As Michael talked on a global basis, we continue to see this as a tremendous tailwind business as you have further and further globalization of demand. As we look at all the different pockets, as I mentioned earlier that the amphitheaters is an example of a mid-level act. We're seeing high single-digit increases in attendance per show, which is really driven by more lawn tickets being sold. So the people that you might say are going to be the most price conscious are continuing to spend strongly per caps growing even as we're continuing to increase our number of fans per show, which again means that even the marginal fan is continuing to spend a lot when they show up. So we're not seeing any indicators that would give us any concern on any slowdowns. Stephen Laszczyk : Great. Thanks for that. And maybe just one on Concert segment margins. It looks like ALM margins were up year-over-year in the second quarter. I think there might have been some assumptions that margins would be pressured year-over-year just given the mix of the slate towards stadium and arena this year. So I'm curious what drove margin expansion in the quarter? And if you think this is a trend that will be sustainable for the rest of the year? Thank you. Joe Berchtold : Yes. As we said in the last quarter, our expectation for the full year on concerts is that you will see margin expansion relative to last year. You're correct that any fan in third-party buildings is generally going to be a lower margin than fans in our building. But the countervailing factors is that we continue to increase the per-fan profitability across all of the different venue types. So as we increase that per fan profitability through all the different ways that we have to monetize, then we're going to see some margin expansion. That comes from increased per caps on our own building, it also comes from continuing to focus on the costs. I think in particular, in North America, we've been very effective. We look at our amphitheaters, if we look at our theaters and clubs globally, we've been able to actually drive down our average operating cost per fan this year relative to last year, which certainly helps with our margins. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. David Karnovsky : I'm curious with your voluntary all-in pricing initiative, I know you haven't implemented this yet. But curious what the reception has been so far from fans, clients, lawmakers. And then, can you discuss, have you thought about any potential demand impact as or for the shows that your venues as I think now optically at least you're raising prices relative to maybe competing locations? And then maybe for third-party venues that would opt-in, how you would think about the demand impact there? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Sure. I think the general reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. People understand that getting the all-in price upfront is absolutely the best consumer experience. I think there is a lot of concern that there will be still confusion in the marketplace because there will be a mix of all-in pricing for shows on our sites and on the primary tickets on our sites and you go to secondary sites, you'll see a different approach. So that's why we continue to support legislation that drives a consistent fan experience. Because we are the primary ticketing provider in these events, I think it's our expectation in general that even that all-in primary price is generally going to still be lower than any secondary price even without service fees. So our experience thus far in New York or Louisiana that's recently implemented it, we haven't seen any impact on our primary ticket sales. David Karnovsky : Okay. And then, Joe, for the $300 million of growth CapEx, I wanted to see if you could provide any additional color around that? How would you bucket that between concerts and ticketing and then within concerts, new builds or other growth initiatives? And then your release noted international locations, specifically for the Venue Nation pipeline. I'm interested, you now kind of see international is the key area where you're going to be adding venues? Joe Berchtold : Sure. I think if you look at the overall $300 million of spend is vast majority of it would be concept-driven, 75%, 80% of it would be on the concert side. If you look then on the concert side, I would put it in 3 buckets. One is where we're doing a lot of tactical improvements across a broad set of our amphitheaters or theaters and clubs around revenue-generating opportunities, putting in new bar designs, putting in additional points of sale, things that are going to tactically help drive our APF levels. Second is, when we renew our amphitheaters or our theaters and clubs, we often go through a CapEx refresh cycle, that because we're going to have a long-term lease, we're going to be able to get a strong return off of that investment. And then, third would be the new builds where whatever level generally coming in and building out the shell and taking on that building would be the third bucket. And it's going to move around year-to-year within those 3, but those would be the 3 large buckets. And then in terms of the priorities, absolutely, international, Latin America, Asia and more in Europe is highest priority for the Venue Nation strategy. In the U.S., you benefit from having a strong arena infrastructure because NBA, NHL, their teams and their affiliate teams provide you with some of that infrastructure that you don't tend to have in the rest of the world. So this lets us both benefit from strongly attractive returns on those venues also, let's just put on more shows for more fans, because we're putting an infrastructure in place that didn't previously exist. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Glagola : Joe, you're on track for $300 million fee bearing tickets this year which is 7% growth over 22. IN the first half ticket growth on fee bearing is 22% year-over-year. So just maybe help us understand what's the slowdown in the second half in ticketing or is that just some conservatism in the numbers. And then I have one more follow-up. Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think it's just -- you don't yet know what Q4 looks like in terms of timing with on sales for shows next year. So I think we're confident in the $300 million number at this point with the visibility we have. When we're sitting here talking next. I think we'll have better visibility into what Q4 is and we'll guide from there. Stephen Glagola : Okay. Thank you. And then similarly on the ticketing margin side, you came in north of 40% again in Q2. You're reiterating high 30s in the back half -- for the full year, excuse me, implies sort of like a mid-30% margin in the back half. But just similar to the revenue line, what's going on there sequentially and the puts and takes. Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think is a long talk. There's a lot of timing that happens with us in a given quarter. I think you saw last year a lot of the same questions. We had lower margins in the second half as we had a lot of costs associated with contract renewal cycles and other factors. So I think at this point, we're comfortable continuing to reiterate the high 30s for the margin, but not yet ready to get more specific than that. Stephen Glagola : Okay. And should we expect contract renewals again for Q3, similar to last year? Joe Berchtold : I don't think we're looking to guide in a specific margin for a specific quarter as much as just give the overall year guidance. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Peter Supino : Question on international with it growing so strongly, more major tourist -- artists touring globally. Has your strategy changed at all? Does this fact invite you to spend more money perhaps on international M&A? Are there other things that you can do now with higher visibility to international demand that you might not have done in the past? And a second shorter question just is on technology. There's all the controversy around bots and scalpers over the last year indicate that the company could productively spend materially more on technology and solve some of those problems? Thanks. Michael Rapino : On the global part, Joe -- I don't think the strategy has changed. I think if you've listened to us for the last 5 years, or longer. We've been talking about that live as a global business, the artist has been unlocked globally. Consumers, thanks to social media and others are driving global consumption with no gatekeepers. So we have 100 offices in over 40 countries. We have been on this march for a long time. And we think there's still lots of opportunity, obviously, as we talked about in Latin America, Pacific Rim, Eastern Europe. But kind of plan is following as we kind of predicted the artists would continue to go global -- more global artists and international markets would want to be just like New York and Boston would want to be hosting U2 and Beyonce\u2019s of the world, so we had an opportunity to build out those markets. So pedal down, we see lots of great growth opportunity for years to come on that front. Joe Berchtold : And on the bots, certainly, new technologies allow us to continue to get more sophisticated in trying to stop the bots. We're regularly working on both the technologies as well as just new processes to try to weed out humans versus bots. Problem is some of the same technologies is also being deployed by the bad actors trying to jump the line and get those they have a $5 billion a year incentive to cheat get those tickets, which is why we've been continuing to advocate and I think we've seen a lot more visibility on some of the behavior that we need or we'd like at least more legislative support in terms of real punishments for the bad actors or the platforms that enable the bad actors, ending practices like speculative ticketing that is clearly price manipulative and anti-consumer. So we're continuing to do our part to fight it, and we hope that we'll be able to get some help with some rules and with some real penalties for people that are trying to cheat. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. David Katz : I wanted to just get an update, if you don't mind, on the digital process, right, digital ticketing, et cetera, and then the second derivative of being able to harvest and drive better returns off of the information gathered from it. So where is that today and where can it go? And how do you see that opportunity? Joe Berchtold : Yes. At this point, digital ticketing is largely ubiquitous globally coming out of COVID. I haven't seen the latest numbers, but I expect it to be the 90s that are now digital tickets. It's a very informed shifting from barcodes to what we call safe ticks, which is rotating barcodes or NFC keep tickets from being counterfeited and sold over and over. So we have a number of initiatives that have launched them to use that data. We've talked extensively about some of the things we've done in marketing, bringing all of our data together to better understand the fan, how we market to that fan. How with the digital connection, we're able to market to them on behalf of our Digimaster clients, how we're able to market to them on behalf of sponsors, how we're able to send them messages for upsells when they go to shows in our buildings. So that all continues. And then in the background, we have Ticketmaster using the data that it gets for a range of, I'll call it, machine learning purposes and tools in terms of helping clients figure out how do they price their shows, how they market their shows, what are the tools that they should use can help our concert folks in terms of understanding likely demand for tours and shows in specific markets. So certainly, now it's the point where that data and now is used is permeated the business. David Katz : Got it. And if I can follow up, please. With respect to Platinum, right, we do have discussions about inflation and the cost of things, et cetera, et cetera, which doesn't seem to be at play here. But where is that? Where can it grow? And any pressure points with respect other than the artists themselves authorizing it, right? Any pressure points toward sort of growth in Platinum and how that mixes you higher? Joe Berchtold : Yes. I want to have characterized it as artists not allowing it. I mean the artists are the ones who are set the price of their tickets. It's our job to provide the information to them to help them understand the market value of their tickets, so they can figure out the balance that's right for them and their fan base in terms of pricing the tickets. So they're getting the value. Are they giving it to the fans, how do they keep it from going to the scalper. A lot of artists now I would say it's almost becoming the standard that they're understanding they should price the front of their house to capture most of the value. Otherwise, it's the scalper who's going to take it. And then they want to make sure the back of the house is priced so that every fan can afford to buy a ticket can get in. The trend we've seen coming out of COVID is, I think, a switch from it being partially used to being very ubiquitous here in North America. And then over the past year or so is becoming much more heavily adopted in international markets. I think we still have a long ways to go in international markets towards full adoption. And if you look at the pricing with platinum, there's still a substantial gap relative to average secondary pricing which would imply that artists are continuing or attempting to give a lot of the value to fans and we'll see how that evolves over time. Michael Rapino : Just to jump in on Platinum. The magic of Platinum isn't to increase the first rows. The magic of Platinum is it gives that artist the opportunity to look at the whole house. We have never, and historically jumped on an earnings call and told you we couldn't sell the first 10 rows out. Our job is always to sell the last 10 rows out in the upper nosebleeds as they call them. So what platinum has enabled the industry to do is as the artist has increased show cost and needs to get a certain gross for that night is we should figure out how to maximize some of the front of the house closer to market, but that's also let us bring the price down in the back end of the house. So the net gross can be more overall, but it's giving fans a better sell-through rate on the back end of the house. We used to be locked into kind of 3 ticket prices that didn't have that opportunity. So the biggest advantage to dynamic pricing and platinum price over the last few years was really just how do you help the whole house gets sold? How do you reduce the prices in the back end of the house? But are always the harder ones to sell so you truly get a full house on the proper gross for the artist and then all of us benefit when more people walk through those doors. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Jason Bazinet : I just had a question on the secondary market. And my question is pretty simple. Is your philosophy or emphasis on this market changed? Because I think in your K, you talked about the GTV on secondary being something like almost $4.5 billion in 22 more than double 19 levels in this release, you're talking about secondary ticketing volumes up double digits. So is this just indicative of the overall strength that we're seeing in consumer interest and going to live events? Or is it something that you're doing as well or both? Joe Berchtold : Well, first off, again, just to keep it in context, we've long said that, first and foremost, our job is to sell the primary ticket. We're a primary ticketing company and its secondary is a kind of low to mid-teens portion of our GTV. So it's relevant, but it's also not the primary focus. We have long thought that we need to be in secondary because fans have a need to buy a ticket. And when a show is sold out if we're not giving them an option to buy a legitimate secondary ticket, then we're forcing them to go to other platforms to buy their tickets, and we think they're better off being served within the Ticketmaster ecosystem. I think as we continue to do a better job with our offer, reducing friction, understanding how to deliver on the fan needs as we've aligned with the NFL, the NBA and others on the sports side have a slightly different model for secondary. I think we've naturally grown our position in the market. But what really matters to us, first and foremost, is that we have a great primary sale, and that's managed in a way that is going to keep content happy. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Paul Golding with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Paul Golding : Congrats on the quarter. I just quickly wanted to see if you had an update on a metric you've given before in terms of the average ticket price and how that's been trending? I think in the past, you've said it's been below $35. And then, secondly, as a follow-up, as we watch sort of the macro tightening in the backdrop and not so much for your business. But in general, in tracking sponsorship, any color you could give on cohorts that are more or less meaningful for that sponsorship growth that you've been seeing as we track forward into this tightening environment. Thank you. Joe Berchtold : So first of all, on the average ticket price, I think what we've talked in the past is that the average -- the entry ticket price, so the lowest price that a fan can find a ticket at for our amphitheaters, for theaters and clubs is generally average below $35. And for the reasons that Michael spoke to, it continues to be below $35 because the artists are wanting to make sure that almost all fans can get in to see their show. And then what you've seen is because their costs have gone up because they've seen what's going on in the secondary market, some of the closer in parts of the house or have increased ticket pricing. I mean, you can see from the overall Ticketmaster, GTV and number of tickets sold that pricing in total is up double digits still year-on-year while the entry prices remain low. On the sponsorship, I'm not sure I fully understood your question. I think we've seen no slowdown in terms of our sponsorship business. We have over 90% of our expected revenue for the year is booked being driven by a lot of the large multi-asset, multimillion dollar sponsors that we work with who have long-term agreements with us that continue to go very well and continue to sign more. Paul Golding : I guess my question around that was more around sector. So for example, if we were to think about sports and sports betting maybe being a predominant sponsor, boost this year or at the tail end of last year. Anything in that type of area of color around the mix. Michael Rapino : We have 900 different sponsor brands. Every category you can imagine is fairly distributed evenly. So we haven't seen any sector pullback that has affected any of the core business overall. We've always said, we believe that our business is a -- it is a much less of an investment than a lot of the other TV and big campaign investments that brands make, it's a much more targeted approach. So we've seen more brands shift some of their dollars from the other categories to the event space where they can kind of get that direct consumer interaction that they can't maybe get on digital and elsewhere. So we've seen most sectors increase their spend in our category. It's been growing, and we've been growing with it. We think that trend is going to stay because as they're all trying to figure out how to connect with consumers in a digital world, we in sports live, give them that one opportunity to hit consumers at scale on a Thursday in Pittsburgh. So we think we're going to see more growth in our category. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansoon-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Two, if I can. The increase in accretion expectations for the year that you call in the release connected with OCESA, imply that the performance there is pacing pretty well above your expectations earlier in the year. Can you talk a little bit about what specifically has been outperforming with OCESA? And then more generally, in terms of Latin America, it's obviously been a focus for you guys. Do you feel like now with kind of touch points in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, that you're in a position where you can kind of expand to the rest of that region organically? Or are there other kind of individual markets where it might make more sense to penetrate through M&A? Thanks. Michael Rapino : We think the -- kind of our global playbook has always been the same. We enter most of these markets, low cost, maybe a bolt-on promoter or festival. We end up having enough content that we can bring the tour to the market, and then we build up the flywheel once we get to that market. So in Brazil, we've got Rock In Rio, an incredible festival foundation. We now have a great touring business there, bringing artists to the ground. We've launched our sponsorship business there, and now we've just launched ticketing there. So I think it's a great combination. We'll see a continual growth in Latin America, Brazil, a big year and Argentina is crazy as the market is on ticket sales. We like the entire market down there. So you'll see us organically grow. We've always been a predominantly organic-driven business and then we'll use continual bolt-ons to keep powering and doubling up on our efforts there. Cameron Mansson-Perrone: How about on OCESA and what's driven that outperformance? Joe Berchtold : I mean that spend across the board. I think on their concert side, we've done well in terms of starting to get shows on our dream platform down to Mexico. Latin artists are clearly on fire. So they've got very, very strong set of regional shows they've been doing. Their festival business is doing great. We've worked with them to get the ticketing platform enhanced and that's continuing to perform very well, and they've been bringing in sponsors. So it's really across all elements of their business, I would say, has well outperformed relative to what we thought when we acquired them or even when we thought 6 months ago, 9 months ago or now this year would be. Michael Rapino : Remember, we bought OCESA in COVID. We believe in the market, did we model out our IRR to think that the industry would bounce back as big as it has, no. So anything we're doing down there has been above and beyond what we expected for Latin market and industry in general overall. And we've got an incredible management team down their partnership with the CEO. They're very, very well-run organization. They've got venues, ticketing we've been able to take a really kind of archaic ticketing platform and continually reinvent it now that we're partners on the Ticketmaster side, sponsorship upgrades. So off their incredible base, our expertise and the market dynamics. It's been an incredible return. Cameron Mansson-Perrone: If I can follow up quickly on one of those points. Is that generally a one-way bringing sponsors from elsewhere into those new markets? Or is there also kind of a reverse dynamic where you're taking local sponsors and also giving them exposure in North America, Europe that they may not have had previously? Michael Rapino : Yes. I don't want to say it's completely one way, but it's our global sponsorship partnership team. When you're sitting with any of these big brands you can imagine and you're trying to sell a global sponsorship that maybe they're only doing with the Olympics and F1 because there's not a lot of global properties, right, the NBA, most sports is regional. So when we can sit in that room, they know we have a big office and in a now market in Brazil, and we can get you to Rio, Sao Paulo and Mexico City and Milan. So the more major markets we can add to our pitch when we're sitting with that CEO, CMO on a global basis, it helps look at our spot ship business that we can now deliver kind of a global platform and bring bigger sponsors to some maybe local deals they had. So we'll always kind of look to replace a local deal with the global deal would be the return we look for. So adding Latin, adding Mexico City out in these markets, big markets for most big brands gives us more markets to sell our global story too. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Harrigan : Down to some fairly down in the [indiscernible]. You did an acquisition in March, Clockenflap in Hong Kong, a great name, by the way. Is that any sort of real expansion platform, and you did put out a release on it. Obviously, that market has -- it\u2019s still early to say the least, but is that a potential growth vector for you? And then, secondly, I guess off Peter's question earlier, some of the issues with [indiscernible] in November weren't so much that the pass could get through Verified Fan is that your network basically couldn't handle the amount of traffic that was generated. Do you feel like you've made sufficient upgrades at this point that if you have the same situation and not going to be another immediate areas too, but if there was, do you think you'd be able to scale appropriately so you didn't have the level of discount to customers? Thank you. Joe Berchtold : Let me take the second one first. This is Joe. Just to be very specific, what happened was there were two vectors of attack during that on-sale. One was a very large number of bots trying to crash into our verified fan system. That slowed down the fan experience, but that did not crash the system, or it could cause it to stop. At the same time, we had what was in effect the attempted cyber hack that was a brute force cyber-attack that had the fact of a dial service attack, not through our front door of our Verified Fan system, but through a specific surfer that we have. In order to fight off that cyber-attack, we had to stop the on-sale. Within 5 hours, we had figured it out how to fully reinforce the defenses to and in fact, move out the defense line so that stopping the cyber-attack. We know the attempted cyber-attack, we no longer have any load on our system for the verified fan experience, we started it back up. So the answer to your question is within 5 hours, we had solved that problem. It's not something that's taken us 6 months or 9 months to figure out how to solve. So we solved it quickly. We ultimately did sell 2 million tickets that day. And once those 5 hours were passed, while it was a long wait at times for fans because there were a lot of people trying to buy the tickets, there were not the system overload issues. I'll let Michael speak to it. Michael Rapino : Yes. You're deeper in the [indiscernible]. What the acquisition were you referring to? Which one? Matthew Harrigan : Clockenflap in Hong Kong, festival. I knew it was small, it got a little bit of a test in the trade meeting and you did put out the press release. I assume it obviously isn't that much of an expansion platform, but if you have any specifics on your ability to do anything on that market and expand more in Asia, outside of Australia and Japan, I thought that would be interesting. Thanks. Joe Berchtold : I would say it was part of a broad bolt-on strategy in Asia. As Michael said earlier, we'll go in and we'll look for local promoters, local festivals that we can bring on and then we can then tie in with our broader concerts platform, bring our sponsorship team into. So it was an example, I would say, of the type of activity or type of M&A that we're doing in the region. Michael Rapino : Just to jump on for others. I mean, we talked about Latin America, but Pacific Rim and others are equally important. It's a global business. So Japan, a real, real important market for us. Latin America, I mean, Pacific Rim in general, we're already in most of markets in some form have offices in Singapore. We've had a very successful operation in Korea, which has been kind of the foundation on why we ended up being the promoter for PTS and other [cape of] [ph] artists throughout the world. So we look at Pacific Rim equally as important is Latin America, you'll continually see us with a bolt-on promoter Venue festival as we're building up that business and driving content there also. Operator Thank you, everyone. This marks the end of the question-and-answer session, and this also concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is John, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation\u2019s Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. And I would now like to turn the call over to Amy Yong, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Amy Yong : Good afternoon. And welcome to the Live Nation third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino; and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. We will start with prepared remarks from Michael and then we will take your questions. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that this afternoon\u2019s call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company\u2019s anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation\u2019s SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation have provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in the earnings release or website supplement, which also contains other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call. The release reconciliation and website supplement can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation\u2019s website. And with that, I will now turn it over to our President and CEO, Michael Rapino. Michael Rapino : Thank you for joining us. As you can see from our results, the structural tailwinds behind our business are accelerating faster than ever and as a fan demand truly globalizes and artist were able throw more broadly than ever, this is still in an unprecedented global desire for concerts. This is happening at all levels with both casual and diehard fans and from small clubs to massive stadium events. We will start the conversation today in the next week a deeper into our results how these trends are setting up the industry for ongoing growth. Joe, anything to add. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Only thing for me to add is that given the investor presentations next week we\u2019ll keep today\u2019s call more brief than usual. So, with that, I will -- I think, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Ross : Hey. Thanks. Just to start-off, since you guys last reported there\u2019s been at least two major articles on the DOJ investigation into your company, as well as some movements in both the legislative and executive branches and industry-wide regulation. Can you just give us an update on what you know about the Justice investigation and then separately, the potential impact of the proposed Congressional legislation? Then I have a follow-up. Joe Berchtold : Sure. Thanks, Brandon. I\u2019ll start first of all just on the legislative, which I think is pretty straightforward. Right now there is an all-in pricing bill by Senators Cantwell and Cruz under consideration. We are fully supportive of there\u2019s a BOTS Act that Senator Blackburn introduced, I mean, you call main, which we\u2019re also fully supportive of, and in general, everything we\u2019re hearing legislatively are things that I think are pretty consistent with what we outlined in the FAIR Ticketing Act and things that we would definitely be supportive of. On the DOJ and the article that came out yesterday. I think, not surprisingly, it\u2019s our impression that the DOJ is taking at least the first level look at almost everything that our competitors complain about and from there they look further at some issues and not others and if they tell us they have a problem with something we talked to them about it. But, let me emphasize this, as far as we can tell nobody thinks that the fundamentals that drive our promotions business are unlawful. We pay top dollar to artists and provide them with top-notch tour support and those are good things. I think the article also seems to reinforce that the investigations looking at specific business practices versus our overall business model, which as I\u2019ve said previously, is my impression-based on what I\u2019ve heard. On the specifics, I mean, recall on the agencies getting document retention letters. I think generally anyone the DOJ\u2019s six documents from gets the cover letter like this saying they should retain documents related to the investigation. So all this tells us is they think the agencies have relevant information, which seems pretty obvious given the topics that are being discussed and competitors complain about. Finally, we obviously find it interesting, as I think, you tweeted that the timing of this always seems to come up at earnings. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real news right now. Concerning the investigation, we\u2019re completing our document production that they\u2019ve asked for. We haven\u2019t even started depositions and our impression is that the investigation is kind of in its mid-stages at this point. And yeah, we have another new story on the day before earnings which we don\u2019t seem to think a coincidence. Brandon Ross : Okay. And getting to the business, your forward-looking metrics and especially the Q3 ticketing results point to real continued strength for your business. But there\u2019s a lot of trepidation now about consumer weakness, especially after some weak guidance from others in the experienced economy. I know Bookings just said, some negative things just now. Is there anything in real-time that you\u2019re seeing at all to suggest fall-off in trends at Ticketmaster. I know like the arenas of the world will continue to sell, but are the Tuesday\u2019s in Pittsburgh still holding up and like really especially for Ticketmaster, as you look forward? Joe Berchtold : Sure. We\u2019re seeing no issues. Let me give you that in the two piece. I think you asked about, first of all, Q3 and then call it October. So Q3 was very strong volume quarter. So it was really driven by ticket volume $90 million fee-bearing tickets that we sold in the quarter, which --and the growth came from both North America and internationally. So we\u2019re seeing that the demand consistent globally. 90% of the growth came from Concerts, which again tells you that the fans are looking to go to the Concerts. The one thing, I would note on Q3 is just a reminder, the last year, we had an unusual concentration of client renewal expenses, which are normally spread out over the second half, but largely came together last year. But really the quarter was about the tremendous volume and tremendous fan demand that flowed through Ticketmaster. Looking then more specifically at just October. If we looked at our Ticketmaster platform for the month of October, ticket sales were again up year-on year relative to last year. They were up double digits in North America. So we\u2019re seeing no sign of weaknesses. Another metric that we look at is as we look at just for our U.S. Concerts division we track every week, year-on year sales and again over the past five weeks since the end of the quarter, those sales continue to be up double digits. So we\u2019re seeing no weakness at all. We gave you the leading indicators for show commitments for next year and we\u2019ll get into a more, but feeling good about everything that we\u2019re putting on-sale. Brandon Ross : Thank you. Michael Rapino : And Brandon just for more color. Yes. Brandon Ross : Yeah. Michael Rapino : I have weekly booking calls with over the 40 Presidents around the world. When we talk both from clubs to stadiums and festivals. And we have not seen anything taper off in any sense or on-sales for next year, whether it\u2019s an early festival across the pond or was there, let\u2019s say, a festival -- a club tour playing in Pittsburgh on a Tuesday, as you say, or maybe the blink-182 who toured last year, now is back on tour again this year playing Pittsburgh just to Cleveland on Wednesday and any pullback in any way from a club to a stadium tour from Malan to Argentina right now. The consumer supply-demand seems to be consistent across the globe small to big. Brandon Ross : Thanks very much. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Laszczyk : Great. Thank you. Joe, there has been a lot of focus on how the Concert segment profitability would shake out this quarter and just given the mix shift towards stadium shows in the slate this year and maybe offsetting that some dynamics around having a more matched revenue and expense structure compared to last year. I was hoping you could help us unpack some of those dynamics and maybe size some of those factors. Just as we think about Concerts profitability this quarter, I think, it would be helpful to contextualize this year and then look forward to next year? Joe Berchtold : Sure. I think, let me start by just noting that, year-to-date our Concert margins are up year-on year and for the full year, I expect margin expansion of at least 50 basis points relative to last year, so making good progress verging on halfway back towards the 2019 levels and that\u2019s despite growth for the overall year that will be definitely skewed to third-party venues driven heavily by stadiums. If we look at the quarter. I think if we look at Q3, about 47% of our fans were in arenas or stadiums, which is pretty good proxy for third-party buildings. The comparable last year for that number was 42%. So we had a lot more fans mix in arenas or stadiums this year. Those two buildings accounted for about 75% of the 7.5 million fans that we added in the quarter. And that does two things, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. It drives our AOI up, because we\u2019re making money on these fans and negatively impacts margins. So that\u2019s why you\u2019ll see the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. We don\u2019t worry a lot about, but I think, if you take the overall combination of high growth and third-party buildings shifts the mix towards more third-party buildings and make substantial progress in our margins for the full year, I think we\u2019re pretty happy as we look at the totality of that. Stephen Laszczyk : Great. Thanks for that. And then maybe one for Michael. You\u2019re coming up on lapping the launch of two fairly significant tours in Taylor Swift and Beyonce. I think there\u2019s some concern that those tours will be hard to replicate as we look ahead to next year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how impactful these tours worry to your business this current year and maybe looking ahead how the slate for 2024 is shaping up and you sort of the opportunity to compensate for some of the notable tours year-over-year? Thank you. Michael Rapino : Yeah. Thank you. Well, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve seen this written, but we didn\u2019t promote the Taylor tour. So I don\u2019t have that comparable to worry about in 2024. Beyonce was our tour wildly successful. But when we look at any artist across Ticketmaster Live Nation, no artists is going to account for more than 1% of the tickets. So no one tour will ever hurt us year-over-year, it\u2019s about our macro portfolio of artists and tours. And we have a very good pipe as we\u2019ve been saying for next year. We think next year -- crazy to say, but sitting here looking at this year that we\u2019re looking at double-digit growth over this year, next year on ticket sales and our stadiums are gaining a lot of steam. So we\u2019re very confident. We\u2019re going to have big record-breaking tours on the road next year as Bad Bunny just went up again and more to come announced -- more to be announced. So we are very confident that well Ticketmaster Live Nation are going to have big strong years next year with a pipe full that we will overcome this year\u2019s numbers. Stephen Laszczyk : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. David Karnovsky : Hey. Thank you. Maybe following-up on ticketing. It looks like your revenue growth well outpaced GTV growth, so interested to understand how non-service fee revenue might have helped in the quarter? And then, Michael, I don\u2019t know if you can say anything on the Mastercard agreement to today -- from today and I don\u2019t know, what other opportunities you see for sponsorship deals to kind of cover your international footprint? Joe Berchtold : Yeah. Sure. I\u2019ll start just on the ticketing. Absolutely, Ticketmaster continues to benefit from the non-service fee revenue sources it has. On the upsells and other services that itself to fans, as well as increasing array of services that it\u2019s providing to venues and promoters are all good sources that are helping us increase the profitability per ticket that we\u2019re selling. Michael Rapino : And Mastercard, we\u2019re thrilled to have him onboard. We\u2019ve been working over the last couple of years to have a great diversity across our partners on the payment side. Thankfully, we didn\u2019t take any of the easy crypto money at the time. We worked hard to make sure we had a stable of great partners. Today looking at Citibank, PayPal and now Mastercard for international rounds out our global portfolio in that category at an overall economics surpassing we historically had. So very, very happy to have them onboard, big part of our business and continue to show strong growth in our sponsorship side and sponsors lined-up to be part of this Live boom. David Karnovsky : Thanks. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Ashton Welles with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Ashton Welles : Thank you. I think you guys are on track to add 6 million fans or so this year at your owned and operated venues. Is this sort of the right run rate to think about going forward or could this step up in coming years? Joe Berchtold : This is an area that we\u2019re absolutely focused on continuing to add venues. So the hope is that we continue to build on that number. I think it will probably not be linear year-to-year as we add to our portfolio, but it\u2019s an area that we\u2019re very focused on building as that tends to be our highest profit, highest margin fan that we serve. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of David Joyce with Seaport Research. Please proceed with your question. David Joyce : Thank you. A couple of related questions, the ticketing revenue particularly blew away our estimate. So I was wondering how much of that is for 2023 events and how much for 2024, and then similarly with deferred revenue being up 39%. I know that some of that is due to the function of when the shows go on sales. That\u2019s not an indicator of what the revenue growth would be. But how much of that would be due to venue mix or the tour type for 2023 shows versus 2024. In other words, how do we use these metrics on an apples-to-apples basis to help with our outlook for 2024? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Sure. So, first of all, at this point, through Q3, we\u2019ve not sold a ton of tickets for 2024. That\u2019s why we focus more on what the show bookings are. So we have sold -- and we sold more tickets this year, which is part of what goes into the deferred revenue, I will come back to you. But we\u2019ve sold on the order of I think 18 million tickets for shows next year. So relatively small portion of what we\u2019re ultimately sell. So that\u2019s not the driver of our Ticketmaster results for Q3. To a very great extent, it\u2019s more of the other factors that I talked about. And then, deferred revenue is up, because, yes, we have sold more tickets for the shows next year. We\u2019ve also sold more tickets for the shows that are occurring in Q4 and it\u2019s our expectation that because of that pipeline and because as Michael noted, it\u2019s turned into a pretty solid period for stadiums, as well as arenas. We expect to see that deferred revenue number continuing to grow for the next seven months, eight months. David Joyce : Understood. I appreciate it. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Michael for any closing comments. Michael Rapino : Thank you, everyone. We look forward to seeing you in New York next week, we\u2019re excited about where we are as an industry and we look-forward to taking you through details next Thursday. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Laszczyk : Hey, great, thank you. Good afternoon. Maybe one on the mix shift in the slate and one on Sponsorship. A lot has been made on the mix shift shifting more towards the amphitheaters this year. Maybe for Joe, just from a modeling perspective, could you help us think through how the mix shift will impact the cadence of revenue growth and margin expansion across the Concerts and Ticketing segments in 2024? And maybe how we should expect the business to pace towards the double-digit AOI growth you called out in the release? And then, on Sponsorship, maybe for Michael, you had two notable tailwinds to the Sponsorship business this year : MasterCard is replacing Amex, and you have Rock in Rio, which is a bi-annual event coming in this year. Is there any way you can help us size the contribution from these two factors and perhaps where else you're seeing demand in the Sponsorship business this year? Thank you. Joe Berchtold : Sure, Stephen. This is Joe. I'll go first. In terms of the mix shift, there's several dimensions of this. Let's start with deferred revenue. Deferred revenue in the level to which it's up is impacted on a timing basis by what we've talked about in terms of stadium volume being lower this year, amp volume being higher. So, you have less Q4 far ahead on sales with the stadiums, so that's going to compress that deferred revenue line that you see as of the end of the year relative to what you'd see in a more normal year. Then, in terms of how that specifically flows through on the concert side, because it's going to be a shift to more outdoor with the amphitheaters, it's going to be more heavily weighted to Q2 and Q3. It's going to have a higher AOI per fan, because we're counting the beer money, the parking money, other revenue streams when we have the fans on site. It will mean, just on a top-line basis, a lower revenue per fan because the stadium tickets tend to be the highest price tickets, so you'll see a real divergence there between the AOI per fan and the revenue per fan. That, obviously, will translate into improved margin on the Concert segment this year, which should particularly come through in the second and third quarters. On Ticketmaster, the way it flows through is that it would have had fewer on sales in the fourth quarter because the amphitheater shows tend to go on sale closer in time to the shows. So, we still outperformed, grew Ticketmaster in the fourth quarter, increased our number of fee-bearing tickets by about 5 million. But that was against the headwind of that mix shift. So, we expect to be selling more of those tickets into Q1 and Q2 for the amphitheater. But because those tickets are deferred from a revenue recognition standpoint at Ticketmaster, you won't see the AOI on those tickets until the shows play off in Q2 and Q3. On the Sponsorship? Michael Rapino : Stephen, does that help? Stephen Laszczyk : Yeah, that's helpful. And then, just on Sponsorship. Michael Rapino : Yeah. I just want to give Joe a macro level on the kind of concert supply just so we're aligned. This is going to be a great year. We're pacing ahead on our arena and our amphitheater business, which is the higher-margin business as we've talked about. So, we're going to have a fabulous year. We're going to be able to monetize that around the world. We actually look at '25, looks like it's going to be a monster stadium year again as that pipe kind of reloads itself. So, I wanted to just make sure on a macro level, we're seeing continual artist supply at record levels. And we made decisions this year, Usher could have been in stadiums. We wanted to get them in arenas this year and put a great show together. Justin Timberlake, Bad Bunny in arenas versus stadiums. So, you make those trade-offs in different years. But the good news for us is we're going to have a fabulous arena/amphitheater year, festival year around the world. That's going to drive our overall AOI margin cash flow. Probably bounce back with some bigger stadium activity in '25 and then the cycle will continue. But as we've stated over our Investor Day, we look at this as continual growth year-over-year industry for the next 10 years on a global basis. And we'll see that again this year. Sponsorship, to your macro point, the demand we're seeing, strong as ever. I just spent some time in New York with my team with some clients, Verizon, et cetera. Our demand in terms of clients that want to be part of this live experience surge right now is stronger than ever, as you can imagine. Most CMO's want to sit down with us and talk about how can they have some part of this live explosion on a global basis. So, we're seeing, as you've seen with Mastercard and updated deal with Verizon and others to be announced, our pipe is up year-over-year. We expect this to continue to be a double-digit growth business, as we've seen in the past. We've seen nothing slowing down there. Stephen Laszczyk : Great. Thank you, both. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Ross : Hey, everyone. How are you doing? Joe, you talked about amps in the answer to the last question a lot in the mix shift this year. I was actually curious what -- I want to better understand the future upside in the amp business. Your portfolio has been fairly fixed for a long time. And you've done a pretty incredible job of increasing per caps over the last decade. Where does the real growth come from in the amphitheater business at this point? I have some follow-ups. Joe Berchtold : Yeah. Thanks, Brandon. Michael Rapino : I'll start, and then you can go in there, Joe. Joe Berchtold : Yeah. Michael Rapino : Just let me step on that. I think Brandon you've heard us talk about it at our Venue Nation Day. We think we're in this double win right now. We think we have global scale that will still continue because of international markets and more to come. But we also have an incredible amount of opportunity to monetize the scale we have. And for the first 10 years, we built scale. We just kind of ran the scale. The last couple of years since COVID, we launched our Venue Nation division and really focused hiring up and bringing in new skill sets around hospitality, best-in-class food and beverage, best-in-class VIP clubs, et cetera. We think our amphitheaters are run very well. As I say, they're run very well like Southwest Airlines. They're very efficient, and they've been great machines to-date. But we think we're seeing when we invest capital on site, we're getting 20%, 30% returns on capital when we turn that grassy area into a VIP club, a membership club. You're going to see Jones Beach this summer. When you walk up to Jones Beach this summer, at an amphitheater, you're going to call me and go, now I get it. Now I see what these -- the machines could double their AOI when you start to really treat them as arenas have been doing a much better job about how do we upscale on site, elevate the experience and take over. So, we think the 50 amphitheaters we have, the bones of them are amazing. They do incredible job. They're efficient. We think we can double the business as we start to actually look inside the hood and upgrade on site, whether it's our Liquid Death idea that has been a huge surge in our food and beverage, our shaker cup, our own custom-branded liquor that we launched on site to our new clubs, we're rolling out to our VIP boxes, to our elevated. If you look at our overall amphitheater business, about 9% of it is premium. We think that should be 30% to 35%, to give you kind of macro numbers. If you doubled that overnight, your business would double in the long run. So just take your current house, upgrade it, double your capacity on a VIP business, and your business would double. That's the simplest way to look at it. Joe Berchtold : Yeah. And then the other half of it, Brandon, is that's making more on the shows from the fans that attend. In terms of the volume of shows, right now, with our current portfolio, if you assume typical amp has about four months of activity on average, our utilization rate is running about 35%. So, we still have a fair bit of space that we can put more shows into our amphitheaters. And while we haven't been growing by leaps and bounds, we are continuing to add an amp here, an amp there, on our hyper-local strategy of continuing to look for more spots that we can put an amphitheater in. Brandon Ross : Great. Then over the past couple of years, I know Platinum has been a pretty big tailwind for probably both the Ticketmaster business and the Concert's business. And I was curious how far along you are in the rollout of Platinum ticketing, both in domestic and international? And then, how you expect Platinum to continue to contribute to the growth at both Concerts and Ticketmaster? Michael Rapino : I'll start and Joe can jump in. Just think of Platinum as it's dynamic pricing, right? It's just pricing smarter. And that's been a skill that we've been -- we have a great in-house team who wakes up every day working with artists, agents, managers on this. And it may be as simple as just figuring out how to reprice. Tuesday night in Phoenix is worth different than a Saturday night in LA. So, being a lot smarter the way you can price your inventory, price the front better so the back sells out, price, et cetera. We think if you look at -- I'll give it two kind of ways to look at it. Outside of the US, we're in the first inning. So, we're just rolling this out around the world. So that's the great growth opportunity obviously. We have it in Europe, but still in infancy stages. We're going to expand it down to South America, Australia, et cetera. So, first inning on the international business, well received when it gets there. Promoters are anxious for it. Artists are anxious for it, because they see when they sell an arena in Baltimore versus Milan, right now, they look at the grosses and say, \"Wow, we're leaving too much on the table for the scalpers. Let's price this better.\" So that's our best sales pitch. So, you're going to see that excel. And I would say on the US business, we're probably about in the fifth inning. The obvious stuff is done at the top end, some artists on kind of the P1 Platinum. But getting all the way through the business, amphitheaters, the B shows, the C, just dynamically pricing that better and smarter all along the way, we see it happen. It will increase your [take] (ph) flow and sell-through rate, all the way to the day -- time you open the gates up. So, we still think that's a multi-year opportunity to continue to grow our top-line/bottom-line. Joe Berchtold : The other way I think about it, Brandon, is that the typical secondary ticket is still almost twice the price of a primary ticket. So, as Michael said, just think of Platinum as being the market priced ticket, artists are going to be more and more saying I want that through the house. I want that to be closer to really take away that scalper margin. Brandon Ross : Yeah. And then, finally not to overstay my welcome here, but one thing I noticed, I've been, I think, covering your stock for many years now. And I've never seen you give the double-digit AOI expectation in Q4. It's always Q1 where you give that guidance. What gave you the confidence to give that type of guidance at this stage versus the usual Q1? Joe Berchtold : I'll start. I think, first of all, our show pipeline is up double digits, very strong for -- driven by the arenas and amphitheaters as we've talked about. Michael gave all the reasons why we're highly confident in our ability to execute at our amphitheaters now. So, the volume of fans that we're confident in having and our ability to drive the profitability off of those fans gives us the visibility and confidence that we're going to deliver double-digit growth this year. Brandon Ross : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. David Karnovsky : Hey, thank you. I guess first, Joe, wanted to see if you could provide some additional detail on the CapEx guide. Where are you deploying the growth capital, and what's driving the incremental spend, including for maintenance versus '23? And I know you've discussed potentially buying venues abroad. So, I don't know if you could say anything on the pipeline for deals and how that could potentially look relative to past years? And then just secondly, in November, you had described a DOJ investigation as in mid stages. So, I wanted to see if you had any update here in terms of timing or where things stand overall with the probe. Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Sure, let me start with the CapEx. As we noted, we're projecting right now about $540 million CapEx, two-thirds rev gen, one-third maintenance. If you look at the rev gen, about $300 million of that is either new venues or major renovations of existing buildings. And about half of that, about $150 million, is our top-four projects, would include major revamp of Foro Sol, which is the top international stadium in the world down in Mexico City. Michael talked about Jones Beach. Those projects would collectively have a return in the 20%s. So, we're definitely seeing some chunkiness now in some projects that cost tens of millions of dollars, happen to have several -- four of them line up this year that drives a lot of that. The other rev gen would be a combination of tactical things in existing venues, a new VIP club, a new viewing deck, rock boxes, some new bar designs that are extremely high returns, generally 40%s, 50%s-plus, sort of tactical improvements and some things at Ticketmaster heavily tied in with the sponsorship group and the creation of new ad units. And then maintenance is a combination mainly of venues, some Ticketmaster. I think that's continuing to rise at a rate lower than our revenue, lower than our ticket sales. So, we're watching that pretty closely and making sure we have that limited. In terms of the... Michael Rapino : I think the venue pipeline... Joe Berchtold : Yeah. Michael Rapino : I'll just say, venue pipeline, I think we've been talking about it since our Investor Day. We're really happy about the Venue Nation team, our global development team. These were skills, really going into COVID, we didn't have in-house at any level. We're kind of best-in-class at this point. We've really scaled over the last three, four years, got incredible global teams working around the band. And we're just seeing, as we hope when we're walking into those RFPs that we weren't invited to, we're walking in and holding our own and winning right now some of the -- some key venues around the world that we'll be continuing to announce. So, we see it scaling over the next five years much, much higher than it was in the past just because we hadn't focused that much on international arenas before, and we see a great path forward on these. Joe Berchtold : And then finally on DOJ. I don't think we've got a lot to report. We continue to answer any questions they have. They control the timing, and we'll watch it play out, but we don't have any specific updates. David Karnovsky : Thank you. Michael Rapino : We're 100% cooperative. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansson-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Thanks. Two, if I can. Michael, you've spoken in the past about kind of the current big shift in the promotion business being a move from kind of national booking and towards increasingly global booking. I'd love to hear just an update on where you think we are in that shift today? And then I thought it was interesting in the release that you're seeing all-in pricing lead to higher conversion. Is that something that you think can lead to adoption of third-party venues, or do you think that stays at your operated venue portfolio for now? Thanks, guys. Michael Rapino : I'll answer. I mean, all-in pricing, I'll start. Yeah, we're actually surprised and thrilled because we were always skeptical, if we would be the one led path, there was any conversion that would hurt us. But I think consumers are loving the idea, they can see upfront. Ultimately they're shopping multiple tabs anyway. So, they're probably figuring out the true costs are the same. So yeah, we think it's a great test. I would say most of all the congressional, senate, all the stuff Joe and I are talking to everybody about, this just seems to be the common torch that everyone's running with. So, I would assume this ends up being legislated somewhere over time, and I would assume others are going to start jumping on the all-in wagon as a good step forward for consumers, so we can worry about the other issues around scalping, et cetera. On the promoter shift, it is a -- it's always the -- it's a three-level shift, right? It's a local promoter or a national promoter and a global promoter. Still lots of great local promoters, why we have 100 offices in 40 countries. Contracts still have to be executed local. So, you have to make sure you have the best local staff in market that can execute at scale on an ongoing basis. Artists have absolutely evolved over the last 10 years, much like they probably have one global record label and one global agent and one global publishing company, as touring became their most important category and expensive. These artists are putting on -- I was at the Drake show last night. I mean, he's -- it's an incredible show, he's carrying to those fans at a huge cost to give back. So, the artists are -- over the last 10 years have started to look for a much more national or global partner, whether it's us, AEG, CTS in Europe, because their needs have changed. They needed upfront capital. They needed organizations that have a wider view on data, marketing, sponsorship, ways to help them think about their global business. Do they go to Japan or not? Do they do Hong Kong before or after? Do we do Pacific Rim? What's the shipping costs? How do we get it all there? So, artists have become globalized brands and artist -- with the consumers, we've talked about. So, absolutely every artist -- the younger the manager and the younger the artist, the more global they're looking for. So, if you're kind of the new manager managing a superstar that's popped on a global basis, you absolutely want to sit down with someone and talk about your global touring plans and when do you go where before -- with one common agenda in mind. So, we're seeing that continual shift and I think you'll just see that continue to move over the next five years. Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Interesting. Thanks. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citibank. Please proceed with your question. Jason Bazinet : I just had a quick question on CapEx. You guys have been so consistent with this sort of 2%, 2.5% of revenues on CapEx. Given what's happening in your business and the high returns on invested capital we can see from the outside, why doesn't it make sense to sort of open up the envelope and spend a bit more? Michael Rapino : Love this question. I think, as Joe and I talked about, coming out of COVID, the prior to last three years was obviously build back up that cash bank. We drained a lot during COVID, so we wanted to get the balance sheet strong again, get our staff, get everyone back in place, hire the skills we needed and plot through our real kind of five to 10-year strategy here. So, we think the way we're producing our AOI to cash flow return now, it's given us all the tools we need to deliver this ambitious growth plan that we laid out at our Investor Day. So, you'll see us move up and down depending if there is a big opportunity, but we've been pretty consistent that we can deliver our growth that we've outlined for you with that current number. Joe Berchtold : And I think the market just accepts it more if we demonstrate it and then do it a bit more. As you said, we've been demonstrating that return on the invested capital. As we continue, we spend a bit more. We demonstrate those returns. The market will let us spend a bit more. The market doesn't tend to want you to take big leaps and big turns. So, we're not doing that. We're just steadily building a pipeline. And as the market sees the demonstrated returns, then you earn the right to continue to do more of it. Jason Bazinet : Looking forward to the number being 3% or 3.5% of risk. Thanks. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Ashton Welles with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Ashton Welles : Thank you for the question. It would be great to get an update on the real-time indicators you guys are seeing on the consumer front, whether that's the performance of on-sales or how shows are closing or on-site spending. Michael Rapino : I'll start and then Joe can jump in. I mean, I see the ticket sale on my daily ticket sale counts. We just went on sale, jeez, within the last week on Usher, Justin Timberlake, Jennifer Lopez, just announced Jelly Roll this morning. These shows are flying out the door from top to bottom. So yeah, we're seeing no slowdown on the consumer from -- I was in Columbus, Ohio for a sold-out Drake show last night. We had two nights in a row sold out, incredible high-merch numbers. They were buying all the sweatshirts and onsite the GM told me they were -- we're doing really strong numbers. So, we're seeing at our current business, they're buying and showing up across the country and across the globe right now. Joe Berchtold : And we're seeing most of these on-sales still selling front-to-back, meaning most expensive tickets to least. So, we're seeing strong demand at all price points. We just went on sale with our lawn passes for our amphitheaters, up double digits in sale on that for the price-conscious fan. So that's going well. Shows are closing. We really have the best per-cap on-site spending right now at our theaters and clubs, just given that its Q1, those numbers continue to be strong and show year-on-year growth. So, all fronts are showing strong consumer demand globally. Ashton Welles : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. David Katz : Hello, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. When we think about the different business lines, how would we think about the trajectory or arc of growth in Sponsorship relative to Concerts? And what I am essentially getting at is whether there is an acceleration of growth in sponsorship and advertising that is begotten from this outperformance and this -- this acceleration that you're seeing in -- on the concert side of things later on? Joe Berchtold : Yeah, David, this is Joe. I think absolutely there are increasing benefits to scale on the Sponsorship business. One of the things that the brands are telling us they're looking for is they want to reach customers at a time when they are open to the brands, which we have, but they want to make sure that it's at scale. That at-scale really matters. So, they're not trying to do a lot of different little programs. And so, we're seeing a lot more demand. We're over $1 billion in revenue on the Sponsorship side. We're 100 -- closing in on 150 million fans. So, we -- over 600 million tickets on Ticketmaster. So, we've now got a scale and that scale continues to beget more scale. So absolutely, we see a very strong continued growth in that business. David Katz : So just to follow it up, and I'm not fishing for any kind of guidance or anything like that. But the growth rate in Sponsorship obviously could outgrow and grow more than potentially that of Concerts at some future day, right, if we're sort of plotting those lines? Joe Berchtold : Well, I think if you look historically, look back since 2010, Concerts has consistently grown faster than our Sponsorship business, and we think it continues to be a strong double-digit growth business. David Katz : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Michael Rapino for any closing comments. Michael Rapino : Thank you. I appreciate all your support, and we'll talk to you at the end of Q1. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is John, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.  I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Yong. Thank you, Ms. Yong. You may begin your conference. Amy Yong : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Live Nation first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino, and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. We would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, regulatory and legal matters, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in the earnings release. The release reconciliation can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website. With that, I will now turn it over to our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Amy. We appreciate there's a lot of interest in what's going on with the DOJ. So let me address that upfront. We obviously know about the press reports claiming DOJ Antitrust division has decided to file a lawsuit against Live Nation, potentially seeking a breakup of Live Nation and Ticketmaster. At this point, we're just about to begin discussions with senior division leadership about the issues their staff has been investigating, which is typically in the final phase of an investigation. Decisions about whether to see over what relief to seek ordinarily made at the end of that process. Of course, we know that some competitors and interest groups are urging the DOJ to sue us and sue us to break us up. Let me add that -- let me address directly. As we previously stated, the DOJ's investigation appears to be focused on specific business practices, not the legality of Live Nation Ticketmaster merger or our overall business structure. Very little of the conduct that DOJ has raised with us relates to the combination of ticketing and promotion resulting from the merger. And most of what does was anticipated and addressed by the consent decree allowing the merger to go forward. Based on the issues we know about, we don't believe a breakup of Live Nation and Ticketmaster would be a legally permissible remedy. Live Nation and Ticketmaster came together lawfully through a merger that the DOJ reviewed and approved subject to divestitures and other remedies. The DOJ has repeatedly stated in court filings that the merger and settlement were in the public interest. Furthermore, structural relief such as the divestiture is rarely granted. Legally, it's only available where there is a strong connection between the corporate structure and the company's ability to engage in the allegedly unlawful conduct. We believe that connection is lacking with regard to the bulk of the issues in this investigation since the conduct under scrutiny falls either within our ticketing segment or within our concert segment and not across those segments.  We're looking forward to our upcoming meetings with the division leadership and remain hopeful that we can amicably resolve any remaining disputes. If not, we're prepared to defend ourselves in court. That's all we're going to say on the DOJ on this call.  And operator, can we now open it for questions for me and Michael? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Brandon Ross : I think you probably hit the biggest investor questions with your statement on regulatory, but I think there is one big question that's remaining in investors' minds. And that's, how do you see the relative value of Ticketmaster inside Live Nation versus as a separate stand-alone company? Michael Rapino : Thanks, Brandon. I think we addressed this in our last call. At Live Nation, we run a very decentralized organization, and I'm very proud that we've built 3 incredible businesses sponsorship concerts and ticketing, and we're about to embark on our fourth venture around Venue Nation. So these businesses all run incredible core businesses on their own. Ticketmaster, as you know, was a stand-alone business for many years. We're proud that when we took it over, we were able to bring some leadership to it, upgrade its technology, open up its platform and elevate its consumer and marketplace much like most enterprise platforms like Airbnb and et cetera. So I've always said these are incredible portfolio of pieces around Live that we own. They are all part of what we think is a great portfolio. But I've also said these are incredible businesses on their own. So I think long term, together or separate these would all be very successful businesses. We happen to think that we like our portfolio today and plan on keeping it. Brandon Ross : Great. And then you're continuing to express confidence in double-digit AOI growth this year. Obviously, you exceeded that in the first quarter, but deferred is actually down. Can you just quickly reconcile that? I assume the makeup is the profitability per fan based on the venue mix, but any additional color you could give would be helpful. Joe Berchtold : Sure. I think there are sort of 2 questions within that question, Brandon. The first is what's going on with consumer demand and then technically what's going on with the numbers. So just to make sure we hit hard on the consumer demand. We are seeing no weakness. The things that we look at that give us an indication of how the shows are selling, how the fans are spending when they go to the site, all continue to be very strong. We alluded to some in release, but just to hit a few of the highlights. When we look at a number of artists that toured last year and they're touring again this year, so those are the best like-for-like examples of demand. We're consistently seeing the sell-through of shows are at or above where they were last year and that the overall grosses for the artists are consistently higher. So no issues at all on fan demand relative to last summer. And when you look at our overall arena volume, which is the largest volume at this point early on, despite a tremendous growth in terms of the number of arena shows, which you could be concerned would lead to some cannibalization. We're seeing no such cannibalization. We're continuing to see strong sell-through as strong as it was last year. And then when we look at on-site spending, theaters and clubs, where we have the bulk of our activity in our venues in Q1, we're seeing strong growth on fan spend. So just to make sure we hit that out of the gate. And then technically, what's going on. I think what's going on with deferred revenue and ticket sales is 100% consistent with what we've been saying for the past 6-plus months, we expected that this isn't going to be a big stadium year, stadium tickets sell earliest. They're also the highest-priced ticket, so they're going to lead historically to a very high deferred revenue number at this point of the year with a shift to more arenas and amphitheaters, you're going to see the sales cycle come in a bit later. And overall, the story for the year is going to be less of a revenue story, more of a shift in the portion of the fans that are in our venues, higher fan profitability, concert AOI growth through margin expansion. I'm still confident -- we still believe in the double-digit growth that we've been saying. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky from JPMorgan. David Karnovsky : We've seen some noise in the press recently around festival demand and that maybe some of the more established events in the U.S., Europe, are seeing challenge in moving tickets. Just wanted to see if you could dig in a bit on what you're observing for live or even the industry? Michael Rapino : Yes, I'll start. We've read some of it also. We haven't said it in our business. We have over 100 festivals around the world. I think currently, ticket sales are up double digits year-over-year. So we're seeing a strong start to our festival portfolio. We also remind you festivals are a huge business around sponsorship, similar to venues with our sponsorship is up over 20% year-over-year on festivals, so we're seeing a strong, strong start to them. We're a global company, so we do see that having a portfolio helps. We've launched some new festivals internationally. We launched about 10 new festivals a year. You're lucky if 50% of them make it to the next year. And I think this year, we started 10, we shut down 6. So you're always kind of cutting off the weak performers and restarting some new ideas. I think the only trend we see overall is, I think the 3-day massive festival that's going to appeal to everybody with a great unique headliner. The kind of with the original part of this business, that seems to be really hard to deliver year on, year out, whether it's Coachella or Bonnaroo, those are big missions to deliver and artists are making a lot of money in arenas and stadiums. So it's not as easy to get that special headliner. Where we're seeing great success, though it's 1- or 2-day festivals that are appealing to a more of a niche, and it's maybe 35,000 people, and it's exactly write down a certain genre of music or a lifestyle, and it's maybe a higher-end business like BottleRock does in Napa. And we've got a couple of great calling festivals out on the coast or Eddie Vedder festival on the [indiscernible] outside of San Diego. So we are seeing probably a shift to more niche 1- or 2-day festivals with higher per heads, higher sponsorship value and less big swings across, let's go after a 3-day 100,000 people. There's still, though, the Coachellas, the Lollapaloozas, the Austin City Limits, they're kind of passage of right, so they'll -- they seem to have a life and will live long. But definitely, if you're starting a new one, you're probably starting a more niche strategy and try to make sure it's a better experience versus just putting 75,000 people in the field. But to us, a big part of our business overall, it's a nice piece in our overall portfolio to drive our sponsorship business, and it's on a global basis, a nice piece of our overall portfolio. David Karnovsky : And then on your venue strategy, just as you look to deploy capital to locations around the world, Can you discuss kind of criteria where it's best for Live Nation to execute independently versus where we've seen you kind of partner with a third-party like an Oak View Group, for instance? Michael Rapino : Yes. We do it all. We've been partners with Legends and Spanaway Group in Boston, bunch of ones in the hopper right now across America on 5,000-seat venues with certain sports owners, everybody that has a sports arena is looking to build out their retail footprint around it. So we're in partnership with -- potential partnerships a bunch of different NBA, NHL or NFL owners who are building out their concourse retail area, and we'll partner with them in capital to help build that out. So we're opportunistic depending who the developer is, and sometimes if there's a partner that makes sense to partner with like we did with [ OBG ] in Austin, we'll do it. But around the world, I would say I was in a venue meeting this morning. We are very, very excited about this division. I called it the fourth leg this morning. The global pipeline of where we think we can take this business that's very unsophisticated outside of America around the AMP Arena large theater business. The lineup of -- the pipeline is long. We've got a lot that we're going to keep rolling out over the next few years. We can do them 100% of our own. Most of the time if the economics are there or if there's a developer, we always will look at that and see if that's a better return on capital also. I would say we are probably the -- we're the one that everyone wants to partner with. So we have great optionality. We are always kind of the first demand partner that a developer is looking to bring us in and be partners with. So we have great opportunities and more opportunities than execution of power right now, but we're building that muscle fast. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Laszczyk : Maybe one on sponsorship for Michael. Revenue was up I think, 24% year-over-year in the quarter. It sounds like a lot of that was driven by strengths internationally. Could you maybe just talk a little bit more about what's driving that growth in international? And is the step-up that we saw in 1Q, something we should expect to see throughout the year, or is the fact that it's more internationally driven? Does that suggest it could be more 1Q, 4Q aided as we move throughout '24? Joe Berchtold : Stephen, this is Joe. I'll get started and then Michael can hop in. A lot of what you're seeing in Q1 is, as you said, it's international. A lot of it is festivals, as Michael was just talking about the high performance of our festival business this year. And in particular, it's what's going on in South America and Asia. So one of the things we really like is that we're balancing out getting the sentiment the Southern Hemisphere growth that will help our Q1 and Q4 business. So I would expect we'll see a good chunk -- we'll see the highest growth rates in sponsorship Q1 and Q4 this year because we're getting real traction building those businesses. Stephen Laszczyk : Got it. And then maybe another one for you Joe or unless Michael wants to jump in on sponsorship? Michael Rapino : No, I would just -- I want to remind you some like sponsorship or any of these numbers we're talking about. The growth is just -- we had an incredible comparable last year. I mean we had 2 record years of incredible growth. So the fact that we're sitting here again growing the business at these levels, I think it's just a testament and a mic drop to anyone debating how powerful the machine is, how hungry customers are to show up at the show and whether the pipe is full or not. So we're extatic to have a 20-plus percent sponsorship year-over-year after growing bigger numbers than that the last couple. I think the demand from brands is big, people -- brands, while they're struggling to figure how to reach customers, know that being on-site, live, touching consumers at festivals and venues and the spheres and all these great live experiences that are happening, it's a very, very hot space, and I think you're going to see this growth continue. Stephen Laszczyk : Got it. And then maybe just one on concert margins for Joe. You called out in the release, full year concert segment margin is expected to be higher than last year. I think with the magnitude of that, depending on some factors, could you just talk a little bit more about the range of outcomes there? What would dictate coming in, I guess, meaningfully above last year versus maybe more in line? Joe Berchtold : Sure. I think probably 3 factors that we're still going to watch play out over a bit of time. One is FX. As we noted, for Q1, we, on a reported basis, were up 7 basis points year-on-year. At constant currency, were up 37 basis points. So clearly, that can have a material impact on how much we grow. Second is just what's the level of Q4 arena activity we have? Q4 is still in the process of being booked. And as you guys all know, the reason I don't love going too deep in the margins is because if we do a lot of arenas in Q4, that could bring down our margin while bringing up AOI and we'll do that all day long. So there's still some visibility to get into those numbers. And then finally, we've talked on the last call about how '25 is already shaping up to be a tremendous stadium year. A lot of the stadiums that they couldn't get access to this year because of the Olympics or Rugby World Cup or any of a -- variety of reasons, they're already stacking up very strong for a great stadium year next year. The only accounting impact of that is you put those shows on sale in Q4, you incur the marketing expense to launch those shows, particularly for stadiums, and then you have to write off all that marketing expense at the end of Q4. So again, irrelevant over the life cycle of the tour, but from a strict accounting standpoint and impact on margins, the more stadium tours that we put sale in Q4 globally, the bigger the expense we hit. So we'll work through all of those numbers as we get closer and provide more guidance. But right now, those are all big factors that are all really good things that have happened, but aren't yet at a point to declare exactly what the margin expansion is going to be. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansson-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. Cameron Mansson-Perrone: So I want to follow up on 2 of the earlier questions on growth and then on the venue business. I guess, first, on the growth outlook for the year. I think you've spoken to potentially more muted growth in the first quarter given the venue mix considerations this year, which makes a 20% growth look even healthier. So maybe -- could you just help frame how we should think about growth this year in light of all that? And then on the higher CapEx outlook from new venue opportunities, Joe, you've talked in the past about generally wanting to prove out CapEx and then ramp it gradually over time. What should the higher outlook tell us about the opportunity you see from this incremental spend? Joe Berchtold : Sure. On the growth, I think Q1 should tell you that we are right to be positive and optimistic about our ability to continue to deliver double-digit growth this year. I gave a little bit in the context of Brandon's questions, but as I step back and say, how is our growth going to look at the end of the year? I think it's going to be driven by concerts AOI heavily concerts margin. It will second be driven by sponsorship as we're continuing to, in particular, build out the international side of that business. And just Ticketmaster because it's losing all those stadium high-ticket price shows is going to have lower growth. So I expect all of the pieces to continue to grow and all of them to be very happy coming off of what as Michael said, were tremendous growth rates over the last couple of years. So to have all 3 pieces of the business continuing to grow is great. I just think that will be the overall tenor of how it is we look back at this year. And in terms of the venues and the CapEx, I think what we should take is that all the buildings that we're opening are performing at or above our expectations that the volume of opportunities, as Michael said, every developer is coming to us as their first choice, whether you're a sports team owner who want to replicate what Fenway Group did around their park, whether you're an international player looking to renovate a building or to build something from the ground, the developers are coming to us because they think that we're effective operators and good partners in terms of helping them make the building successful. So I think it's just a continued build-out of the pipeline, and this is still incremental but continued strong performance and strong pipeline. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Peter Supino : I wanted to ask first about -- more about the venue build-out project. I'm wondering if in your comments 3 months ago, about longer-term growth view that the company could compound AOI at a double-digit rate for many years to come. If you didn't build any big 15,000, 20,000 student arenas outside the United States, could you still achieve that goal? It's just a way to ask whether that capital project and the returns from it are built into your long-term outlook. It's a question we've heard a lot from clients. And then related to that, I wonder, when you talk about returns on capital, maybe as a company or specifically on these venues, how are you [indiscernible] those returns? Is that an EBITDA number? What are the numerator and denominator? Joe Berchtold : Yes. In terms of the venue build out, of course, that's part of our long-term plan. I mean we lay out every year, generally at Liberty, the 6 or 7 levers, and how it is we're going to continue to drive strong AOI growth over time. When we did that last year, venues were, I mean, the largest component of that. So it's absolutely part of our thesis and part of how it is we're going to get to that continued strong growth rate. In terms of the performance, I mean it's a standard return on invested capital. So we look at it on a cash-on-cash basis, cash out, cash back to the business. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet from Citibank. Jason Bazinet : I just had 2 questions related to disclosures actually. I know you guys have been building venues for decades, but when you talk about standing up a fourth business with our destination, are you hinting that you might disclose that as a second segment or not? And then my second disclosure question is, I noticed in the Q, there was something, I guess, that FASB came out with in November about expense disclosures. I don't know if the Q says you're still sort of deliberating that? But any sort of color on what that FASB request is, and how you're thinking about it would be great. Joe Berchtold : In terms of venues of the [indiscernible] business, at this point, we're not thinking about them as separate segments. We still organizationally have concerts and venues under the same organizational structure. So it'd be premature to think about it in terms of the segments down the road, who knows. It's just -- we're trying to get everybody internally also focused on this as an important area to be growing. So that's why we use that term loosely. In terms of the -- any FASB, generally, what we're doing is any time there are new accounting regulations, we're going to be studying them until the day that we need to implement them. So I don't think anything here would be any different. We're just going to always use the time we have to make a full assessment of what lead way we have, and how we do things and make the selection and prepare whatever revisions we need to be ready. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Benjamin Soff : Just wanted to ask about concerts attendance. It looks like there was a bigger step up in North American attendance compared to international tenants this quarter. So can you unpack that a little bit and talk about how you think about growth in each region for the year? Joe Berchtold : Sure. I think that is largely a function or fully a function of the international stadiums we had, particularly Southern Hemisphere in Q1 of last year and just fewer stadiums as we've been talking about. So that meant that the primary growth in Q1 was in North America. Overall, this year kind of define the trend of where international is going, which is an increasing share because a lot of the growth will come out of our amphitheaters, I probably would expect disproportionate growth out of North America. Again, I think it's out of character in the sense that if you look at all of the business where we're adding capacity with our venues, where we're adding ticketing clients, where our sponsorship is growing, we've got a heavy structural trend towards international growth and international being a larger portion, I think that just from a cyclicality standpoint this year, there may be a bit of aberration in that, but no change in terms of the overall trend. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of David Joyce with Seaport Research Partners. David Joyce : Two questions, please. First, when you look at the metric of country attendance versus the population, the U.S. over index is the rest of the world. What would be your path to growing that concert attendance per capita going forward? And then secondly, on ticketing, what are the plans from here for upgrading the ticketing platforms around the globe, and what -- how much is in CapEx versus OpEx? Joe Berchtold : So in terms of driving the fan attendance, we've been talking in North America for past several years about a hyper-local focus and that has absolutely been helping us drive our penetration, if you want, on a per fan basis. That will continue, and our expectation is we'll continue to build our fan base in North America. The other thing that's just generally going on is, every year, you have the same artists who've been touring -- back out touring on whatever cycle, and we're adding in more hours. We added in K-pop. We added in Latin. Now we're adding in Afrobeats. So we're adding in more artists, which also draw more fans, and that will continue to help with the penetration. As we look at the international markets, it's all a function of how penetrated are they in the major cities where we have a presence. In a lot of markets, we think that there's the opportunity for driving that through additional venues, ties into our international venue strategy that Michael was talking about earlier. In other markets that may be more penetrated like the U.K., you're going to see more of a hyper local strategy, which is why we continue to focus on making sure we got a lot of activity going to Manchester, not just London. So every market is a bit different, but certainly a focus on how we continue to get more fan growth from the biggest to the largest. In terms of ticketing, I think we've talked a lot about the tremendous progress we think that we've made. We think we've got the leading enterprise software system in the world, and you continue to develop products for that. A lot of that cost is in CapEx, but it's been a pretty stable investment level over the past couple of years. We expect it to continue as we are delivering new products for both the enterprise customers in the marketplace, but nothing dramatic changed. Operator : I would now like to turn the floor back over to Michael for any closing comments. Michael Rapino : Thank you, everyone, and we'll look forward to talking to you in the summer. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Amy Yong, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you, Amy. You may begin. Amy Yong : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Live Nation second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino; and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided definitions of these measures, and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. The release reconciliation can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website. With that, we are now ready to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question Stephen Laszczyk : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Joe, on fan count, it looks like it grew 5% in the second quarter with some diverging growth trends between North America up 26%, international down 16%. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the attendance trends you're seeing across region and then within that across venue type. And then maybe related to that, there's been a lot of attention just on tour cancellations and consumer demand over the last few months. Could you comment on what you're seeing on that front, then to what extent you think that demand extends into the back half of the year and what that means ultimately for attendance growth into the back half of '23? And then I have a follow-up for Michael. Thank you. Joe Berchtold : That's about a four part question. Let's start with some of the easier pieces. In terms of cancellation rates, our cancellation rates, we're seeing historical norms below last year. They historically run kind of 4% to 5% of shows, about 1.5% of fans, absolutely in line with historical trends. I think most of the reports that we've seen have been efforts to take one or two data points out of a very large number of tours and shows, and we're just not seeing anything unusual there. In terms of overall demand, continues to be extremely strong. We tried to highlight here a couple of casual fan metrics that we think are important where obviously, we've heard a lot of things from other companies over the past weeks or month or so. One is, just when we put on promotions or summer concert week back in May or more recently our four pack promotion, those tend to be focused on the casual fan, and we've seen increased interest of fans and their purchase behavior, so that's positive signal. The other signal that we look at is, how do shows close in the last couple of weeks before the amps play off, are people buying more of those lawn tickets as they're making the last minute decision on whether or not to go to the show, that number is up 16% year-to-date. So again, seeing very strong casual demand there. And finally, once they go to the show, what's their behavior, and again, we're seeing no issues that we continue to be on track for a couple of dollars' growth in our APF spend at our amphitheaters. So I think it's all consistent with our concerts being seen as very good value, two-thirds less than $100, a third of them less than $50. It's a much more memorable event than a lot of other experiences you can get at that price point. So we continue to feel very good about the strong level of consumer demand we're seeing. In terms of the specific fan count numbers that we've seen over the quarter and over the first half of the year, I think it really is venue type driven. It's not so much geographic driven. It's very consistent with what we've been saying for the past year. This was not going to be a big stadium year. You're seeing that play out in terms of lower stadium shows, lower fan count, that impacts our international number. North America, where we've had very strong performance, particularly on the amphitheater side. As you see here, we said amphitheater attendance up 40% for the second quarter. So it's really that amphitheaters are up very strongly year-to-date. Arenas, theaters and clubs, all up double-digits as well. So you're seeing in totality continued growth despite the -- not having the stadium shows this year. And just from a geographic standpoint, that happens to benefit the U.S. doesn't make any comment on any kind of macro longer-term trend. As we head into the back half of the year, again, no underlying issues on fan demand at all. We expect to see continued growth in the fan count over the course of the second half. I think most of that will come in Q4, Q3, you'll see the continued impact of the stadium show count. And I think we had -- if we just look at the summer season, Q2, Q3, probably about two-thirds of your amp growth in terms of shows and fans was in Q2 as we got started earlier in the year and the majority of arena shows as well. So -- but we expect still solid fan demand growth -- fan growth overall for the second half of the year, again, probably more in Q4 than Q3. Stephen Laszczyk : Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe just for Michael. As you look out into 2025, any early reads on how the auditorium pipeline is shaping up. I think, in the press release, you mentioned it was expected to be a busy year. Just any more color or commentary around that, particularly on the stadium front and arenas and amps as well. Michael Rapino : Yeah. As we said from day one, this is never going to be a big stadium year. We're thrilled that we can still grow the business coming off two years of extraordinary growth, given where we were in 2019. So it's still a strong year for us overall. Stadiums were always the challenge, international was always going to be a stadium issue given Paris Olympics. Most of France shut down for that month, and most of that affected a lot of the stadium business for the summer. So the good news is, as we predicted, '25 looks like to be a big banner year again. We're looking right now at our stadium pipeline for '25. It's bigger right now than it was two years ago for '23. Our amp and arena is bigger right now than it was last year at this time in terms of our pipeline. So we've always thought 2024 would be the year of AOI and amphitheaters and arenas and '25 will be back to a solid continual growth of stadiums. And as we've always predicted post-COVID, we'd be back to an 8%, 9% compounded annual growth as an industry on the top line, and we'll see that come back to life next year and probably more. Stephen Laszczyk : Okay. Thank you, both. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question Brandon Ross : Thanks. I'll try and keep it tight. Just as a follow-up there on Stephen's seventh question, I think that was. Just in terms of the stadium activity and what does that look like for you in terms of ticketing performance the rest of this year? Should we expect a big Q4 this year, similar to the types of Q4s that you were putting up in larger stadium years? And where does that kind of bring ticketing overall for the year since there's relative weakness in Q2 and Q3 given the mix? Joe Berchtold : Sure, Brandon. Let me also just start that with a little bit of context. I think we look over a multiyear trends entering this year since 2019. Ticketmaster AOI was up around 130%, sponsorship around 85%, and concerts around 35%. So I think one of the things we're seeing this year is, as you'd expect, as the businesses grow, some normalization and those numbers start to come together more. So that said, we -- our views on Ticketmaster remain unchanged. We think it's going to be a mid-single digit growth this year. It's going to be Q4 driven by the on sales Michael was just talking about with the stadium activity. And I think in general, a lot of people have just under-modeled the stadium impact, good and bad. I think it's been under-modeled, the upside in Q4. As I've said in the past, from just purely a ticketing perspective narrowly to how they do their numbers, one stadium show is triple the fan count and triple the average ticket price of an amphitheater show. So while overall, those amphitheater fans are very valuable to us as a company and have helped drive our AOI growth this summer and this year overall, as you look specifically at the ticketing segment, you're going to see it impacted the other way. Brandon Ross : Great. And then just overall on the lawsuit, I don't want to ask about where you stand with the DOJ, but just wanted to ask how that whole situation overall is impacting your strategic decision making. When you look at M&A opportunities, both domestically and abroad, is that piece of it in the back of your mind and laying how you allocate capital now at all or are you just straight ahead as if there was nothing going on? Joe Berchtold : Yeah. We're able to isolate. So if you're -- in my legal department, you're working on the DOJ. If you're running any one of my divisions, it's business as usual. So we are -- we've always said for the last while, we've been focusing on ventilation, global venues around the world. I think we put in that press release, we've got 15 coming online over the next year. Still 75 or so in the pipe. I had a venue meeting this morning. We looked at 10 new venues that we're looking to build across the U.S. Latin America and Asia in the pipe, so business as usual. We think there's still a great, great white space on a global venue basis and ticket, I think you saw last week, we expanded ticketing in South Africa and have a few more of those on an international basis. So lots of opportunities still ahead of us and business as usual in the divisions. Brandon Ross : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. David Karnovsky : Hey. Thank you. Joe, Michael, we've heard from some other live entertainment companies recently kind of talked to a pull forward in demand post-COVID, and that's starting to normalize. I'm curious for your view on this, as it relates to comps or do you think there was any pull forward from kind of late '21 through '23? Is there anything in your kind of data to indicate that the frequency of concert going ramp to an unsustainable level and is now kind of moving back to trend line? Joe Berchtold : Yeah. I find the concept to pull forward for experiences like concerts to be a little bit of an odd one. I think that we have long said this is a supply driven business. The demand is there, notwithstanding the fact we have a lot fewer stadiums this year. We're actually still growing our show count. We're still growing our fan count, We've talked a lot about new artists. We talked a lot about global artists, Afrobeats, Latin, K-Pop, exporting country. So I think what we're seeing is an acceleration of the continued globalization on the demand side, the artist seeing that they can go everywhere in the world. We'll have some shifts in terms of venue types and exactly which markets have which level of activity. But there's nothing that would suggest that we're really deviating from historical trajectories on the ongoing growth of the business. Michael Rapino : [Multiple Speakers] We never predicted that the industry was going to grow at 30% a year going forward. We always wanted to restate that regardless of some of the COVID pent-up demand or some of the shows that got moved around this industry on a global basis, supply demand are the basics still sound, are they going to grow at a 9%, 10% a year growth rate. And we see all of those trends we've talked about over the last year. Globalization, consumers wanted to get to the show from Colombia to Pittsburgh, globalization of the artist, supply/demand, experience economy still make this industry overall, probably one of the best industries you're going to find out there, continued double-digit growth amongst many of the divisions as well as on a global basis and a 9%, 10% annual base. David Karnovsky : Okay. And then your amp show count and attendance growth were particularly strong in the quarter. Joe, I think you might have said before more of the show count growth slowing to Q2 this year due to an earlier season. And can you just frame what that should mean potentially on a relative basis for AOI growth for margin in Q3 relative to Q2? Joe Berchtold : Yeah. I think Q3 is pretty much always our high water mark on margin as we have the high volume of festivals in addition to the amphitheaters. I'd see no reason for that not to continue. We expect to continue to have AOI growth as a result of that margin expansion. I'm just trying to -- I was trying to give you guys a little bit of more specific context for the modeling, but we expect this to be a very strong AOI growth year for concerts. I gave some of the numbers earlier, where I talked about more normalization. So we do expect concerts to carry a lot of growth for the overall company this year. And we think that margins are moving back towards 2019 levels. I always hesitate to give exact margin forecast because a lot of it depends on our volume of on sales in Q4 that results in the expensing of marketing, but expect that we're moving back towards the 2019 margin levels on a full year basis. David Karnovsky : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Cameron Manson-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Thanks. Two, if I can. Noticed that take rate has been up nicely at Ticketmaster this year, year-to-date. Is that success in some of the efforts that you've taken to kind of improve the ancillary monetization there or what's factoring into that? And then Joe, on the higher CapEx guidance, given the comment about pull forward in the release, does that mean lower growth in CapEx next year? How should we think about that? And on the note that you expect to generate free cash flow conversion consistent with last year despite how CapEx is ramping this year, just any context in terms of how you're achieving that given the CapEx ramp. Joe Berchtold : Yeah. I think in terms of the pull forward, what we spoke -- we're speaking to specifically is we're now expecting to have 14 major venues open between '24 and '25 as opposed to the 12 that we had last quarter. I think it's very early to start talking about '25 CapEx, as Michael talked about on an earlier question, we're regularly looking for all the venue opportunities we can find globally. He spends a lot of time with the teams in every market, looking at that. So I think that we'll continue to make those decisions on next year\u2019s CapEx based on the opportunities. And hopefully, there will continue to be a lot of great opportunities with kind of 20% plus return profile that we tend to look at. In terms of the free cash conversion, I think those numbers, the cash conversion that we use is after maintenance CapEx and before growth CapEx, so the growth CapEx numbers since the growth in the number in the forecast was in growth CapEx. I don't think that impacts how that number flows through. Back to your first question in terms of the Ticketmaster, Ticketmaster is continuing to perform well. Again, adding a lot of clients internationally, continuing to have strong renewal rates, both in North America and internationally. We're growing our upsells and ancillary spend with the ad units at Ticketmaster. So I think the underlying performance and the health of the business continues to be very strong. The fact that it's -- the AOI in Q2 was actually as high as last year given the volume of stadium shows that they lost in the second quarter, the fact that it's still one of the top five quarters that it's had are all indications of the great performance and strength of that business on a multiyear basis. Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Got it. All really helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Peter Supino : Hi. Thank you. I was -- I wanted to ask two questions, one on the concert segment with really high growth. I wondered if you could parse the contribution from Venue Nation versus the Promotion Function? And then a question on growth CapEx. Your press release talks about 30% returns on venue upgrades. And in prior discussions, you aspired the 30% returns on some greenfield venue builds. If Venue Nation generally does invest capital at a 30% incremental return, should we take the difference between total CapEx and maintenance CapEx and multiply that by 30% to forecast a return on your growth CapEx or would that be an oversimplification? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : So first, on the Venue Nation versus the concert promotion, really because that's transfer pricing, we don't spend a lot of time trying to separate the two. We don't have, I would say, fully distinct P&Ls that would give you at the AOI level, I think, what you're asking about. We do look at the returns that we generate, the returns that we generate from all aspects of the business to give you a feel that we're creating a lot of shareholder value as we're opening new venues and making other CapEx investments. I think that what we've said historically is, we strive for 20% north or higher on major renovations and new builds, and as we showed here, 30% plus on some more tactical improvements. This is also all the venue based CapEx. There's also Ticketmaster and other CapEx that we make. So I think it's probably a bit of an oversimplification, particularly if you're trying to apply it to a single time frame given that the CapEx is often ongoing for a couple of years on the major projects. So you have a little bit of timing complexity there. So it's probably just not quite as simple. Over time, you get those returns, but not if you're trying to do this on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Peter Supino : Thanks, Joe. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question. Barton Crockett : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask maybe a little bit more about what's happening with sponsorship. So the revenue was up 3% in the quarter, but AOI was up 10%, and you're guiding for the year. You're talking about double-digit bookings growth and stable margins. I was just wondering if you could explain what drives the acceleration in the top line but kind of the give back on the margin? And just talk generally about the health of what you're seeing in sponsorship at this point. Joe Berchtold : Yeah. I'll give you some specifics on the margins, and Michael can comment on overall. I think the business continues to be a 60% plus margin business, very strong. I think as I long said, when overanalyzed single quarters, I think over the course of the year, we'll continue to deliver similar margins as we have in past years. This is all apart to, as Michael talked about, when you have a high-single digit growth business that underlying in the industry level, and we're overdelivering that, part of that over delivery is if you look at sponsorship, it\u2019s been in the teens historically on an AOI growth basis. And as we continue to grow the fan count and grow the overall business, we expect we\u2019ll continue those sort of historical growth rates. Michael Rapino : Yeah. And I would just say, as an overall, given I work with the team a lot on our big clients, we\u2019re seeing discontinual upgrade moving from a regional deal to a global or a national deal. That has been our biggest strategy over the last five years, is upgrading from a local to a national deal with a larger relationship and a longer-term relationship more integrated. And the lineup continues to be strong on all major brands. All CMOs look at us kind of like the NFL and want to find ways to work on our digital, our on-site, our festivals, our tours, the artists, all the different ways they want to attach the live music. So we think continue to be a great business on an AOI growth basis for a long time. Barton Crockett : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Michael Rapino for any closing comments. Michael Rapino : Thank you, everybody. Have a great summer, and we'll talk in the fall. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Yong. Thank you, Ms. Yong. You may begin your conference. Amy Yong : Good afternoon and welcome to the Live Nation third quarter 2024 earnings conference call.

And as everybody knows, we have our investor presentation coming up Wednesday and then again on Thursday. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment while we poll for questions. And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Ross : Hi. Thanks for the questions. First, you gave a lot of very positive forward-looking indicators in the release. I was hoping you could help us think about how that's eventually going to flow through the P&L. And I guess on the Ticketmaster side, it's been a tough year. Assume that outlook on stadiums is going to reverse that trend, but how will that look over Q4, Q1 and next year from a timing perspective? And then on Concerts, it was a big margin year. Can that continue next year in addition to the obvious topline growth that the indicators are showing? Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Brandon. This is Joe. I'll start and then Michael can add. Starting with Ticketmaster and starting with Q4, as we noted for October first quarter of the month, Ticketmaster sales were up 15% year-on-year. Concerts, they're up 23%. So, we're expecting that great stadium and arena pipeline to start to manifest itself in Q4 and deliver a very strong Q4 in Ticketmaster. Next week alone we have over 200 stadium and arena shows going on sale. So, we're, I think in a period of unprecedented level of activity for Ticketmaster in Q4. And then that will continue into Q1 and through next year. We expect next year's Ticketmaster to look more like a '23 where you've got that great volume of stadium activity that you get with the on sale, but then you also get as it plays off and some of the deferred events that you have in Europe that you recognize as the events play off. So, a strong Q4, strong next year for Ticketmaster. Concerts, obviously, next year, expectations strong for a continued AOI growth, having growth in arenas and amphitheaters from our baseline of this year. Added to that, the more like '23 or beyond in stadiums should be very strong revenue growth, very strong AOI growth. I think it's probably a bit early to know the exact mix of all those venues for margins, but overall, both strong revenue and AOI growth for the Concert business. Brandon Ross : Okay. And a lot of investors think that Trump is going to be a very good thing for you. I'm sure you've studied it very closely. Just wanted to hear what your thoughts on, are on how he's going to approach antitrust and the associated remedies. Do you think they will favor structural or behavioral? And then separately, from a timing perspective, when do you think you'll next have an opportunity to get to the table with the DOJ? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Thanks. Yes, I think, it's still very early in the transition process. So, we're hesitant to say too much, but absolutely, we are hopeful that we'll see a return to the more traditional antitrust approach where the agencies have generally tried to find ways to solve problems they see with targeted remedies that minimize government intervention in the marketplace. And without getting into the specifics, at least some parts of the case, we think believe reflect a much more interventionist philosophy today than you'd expect of a Republican administration. Obviously, the request to break up Live Nation and Ticketmaster would be an example of that highly interventionist approach. So, we'll obviously be ready to engage as soon as they are. They need to get through the appointments and get things settled on their end, but we'd certainly be hopeful that we could start engaging with them early in next year. Brandon Ross : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. David Karnovsky : Hi. Thank you. Just two from me. First, on the revision to 2023 financials. Can you walk through what triggered that and what the notable changes are? And I didn't see it in the release, but you have an updated '23 AOI and free cash flow. And then second, you called out for Q4 a possible mid-teens FX impact to NOI due to LatAm. Can you just refresh us on the general mix of LatAm versus other regions in the fourth quarter? And then any early view on how to think about FX into '25? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Sure. So, first on the revisions to the financials. So, for context, what we had is we had a non-cash non-operating tax adjustment that we had to make. This has to do with when we purchased Ocessa and a difference between statutory and US GAAP accounting on some non-consolidated investments. So, it was just on the US side. We missed -- we paid the taxes in Mexico. We missed it in the US. It was not material to our '20 or '23 numbers, but working through with the auditors, we made the decision, it made sense to restate those numbers. So, again, a one-time non-cash non-material to those numbers. In terms of the FX impact, we had previously talked about Q4 this year looking strong in Latin America, which it still does. All the operating metrics we've been talking about in terms of both the supply and the demand profile are looking good. We've also just seen a downturn in the FX on Latin American markets over the past several weeks. And because we had a disproportionate amount of growth in the numbers coming from those markets this fourth quarter, we just wanted to flag that, therefore that has a disproportionate impact on our AOI and NOI for the quarter. We don't look at it as being material when you step back and you look at the full year '25 and the magnitude of activity that we're going to have. It's more just a Q4 modeling point for people to be aware of and we'll see how some of the FX plays out over time and we'll update you. But I don't think it's a material '25 issue at this point. It's really just more a '24, which tends to be our lowest activity. So, when you have your lowest activity quarter and you have where your growth is coming from get impacted by FX, so that can just start to swing things around. David Karnovsky : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Laszczyk : Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. Maybe first for Michael, you called out in Sponsorship the number of strategic partners increasing by 20% this year. I'm curious, looking out to '25, how you would encourage us to think about the Sponsorship business next year. Are there any verticals of the business where you see maybe outsized opportunities for execution where you could replicate this performance? And then second for Joe, on the Concert segment AOI in 4Q, you called out some of the on-sales coming in over the next couple of weeks here. I'd be curious if you could help us think about how much marketing spend could be associated with those on-sales and maybe any color on just how to think about 4Q Concert segment AOI. Thank you. Michael Rapino : Thank you, Stephen. On the Concert, on the Sponsorship side, again, we'll be giving more guidance this week as we get to our Investor Day. But Sponsorship has continually been our star for the last decade or so, multiple years of double-digit growth. We look at this business still very, very strong, very different than maybe some of the advertising challenges other companies have. We see overall companies spending more money on-site experiential and moving dollars into that segment. And anytime that happens, that's good for our business. We tend to rise with that. So, we look at '25 and onward as continual AOI growth that we've been able to deliver in the past in Sponsorship. One of the foundational drivers of that is our globalization. And every time we do more shows around the world, we provide ourselves more opportunity and more sponsors. So, when you're doing all these Latin American shows, when you're doing shows now in India, Middle East, Singapore, Asia, growing our Australian business, it just provides us more and more inventory to open new borders and new relationships. So, as our global pipe continues to grow, so will our Sponsorship and we'll see continued growth. Joe Berchtold : And Stephen, as it relates to Concert in Q4, obviously, Q4 in Concerts is a peculiar beast because in some regards, right, the more we're ramping up for a great next year, the more that impacts our AOI. So, I think, as we're standing here, we'd expect a double-digit increase in our advertising expenditure that we have to write off at the end of the year. We're certainly ramping up activity and personnel to be prepared to handle the tremendous volume of shows that we're doing next year. But I think even with all that, as we're looking at the numbers now as again as the broad context, we do expect our margins for the full year in the Concert business to land around where they were in 2019. I'm not going to worry three or four months from now, plus or minus 10, 15 basis points, but I think that in total, we expect it to come in around where we were in 2019. Stephen Laszczyk : Great. Thank you both. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansson-Perrone from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Thank you. On the CapEx increase, I was wondering if you could provide some color on what the pipeline right now looks like for new venue opportunities. And then for the new AMP project, anything further on what changed to pull that forward? I'm assuming that was already in the pipeline as of July, and it's more of just a timing consideration, but any color there? And then to follow up on the Sponsorship question, Michael, growing the number of partners that are generating over 100, sorry, 1 million. Can you talk about, is that new sponsors or is it expanding current or existing relationships? And maybe what's allowing you to execute, if it's growing those relationships, what's allowing you to execute so well there? Thanks. Michael Rapino : Quickly on Sponsorship, see, for a few years, we've been saying anytime you can take that regional relationship or that started that relationship at a large brand, form that relationship, deliver for them, we tend to do good at then getting the next time around with the CMO talking broader programs. So, we continue to grow our current base of sponsors. We tend to have a very good renewal rate and we tend to be able to upgrade you once we've gotten you into the ecosystem and understand your brand needs. So, most of it is coming from current customer base of our 900 to 1,000 sponsors and growing our current base with them and then obviously expanding outside markets. On real estate, Joe will give you the updates. We continue to have a great pipeline. We'll take you more of details for you this week in terms of what venues are going to be kind of rolling out into '25 onward and the CapEx returns on that. Joe Berchtold : Yes. And on the specifics of the CapEx here for the quarter, as you know, we often build buildings in partnership with others. So, this is a situation where we have a partner we've been talking to for an extended period about doing an amphitheater together. That partner had already put a fair bit of capital into the ground and it was only recently that we then signed the formal agreement. By signing the formal agreement, which would give us controlling interest in the amphitheater, we then need to move all the CapEx onto our books. So, you saw the increase of $50 million of expected CapEx for the year, but you also saw a $30 million increase in the capital coming from other parties. So, most of the capital on this project is what a partner has already put into it. So, the net cash that we're putting out is somewhat less than that. In terms of the new venues, as we noted in the release, we expect to bring 14 more venues online, either with substantial refurbishment or new-build over the next year and change through the end of '25 accounting for about 8 million incremental fans. As Michael noted, we will get into more detail on sort of the mid-range planning on venues over the next couple of days. Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Got it. That's all helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Peter Henderson with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Peter Henderson : Can you provide some color on what initiatives are resonating most with fans and driving up the per-caps? And where do you think per-caps can go over time? And then just related to that, I mean, how much opportunity remains to implement tiered experiences and where are you monetizing on super or premium fans the most versus regular or casual fans? Thanks. Michael Rapino : Well, I'll give a quick shot again. We'll get into more detail this week because those are pretty strategic broad questions. On the premium fan or super fan, I know I hear other companies talk about it. We've been selling to the super fan for quite a while, we call that the premium fans that launched a VIP experience at the show. So, that's kind of been an ongoing skill-set we've had forever. Our job every year is, we see that pie still underserviced. We've used percentages in the past 2%, 4%, 6% of the show is premium. We think it can grow up to 20% and more. So, a lot of the refurbishments we're doing at venues is about taking regular seats and turning them into better experiences for premium experiences at night. So, we think premium experiences is a big underpin to our entire growth forward because it's using the same customer base, but we always sell out of the boxes, sell out of the premium inventory first, we never have a problem selling that. So, we think that is a big part of our CapEx and our refurbished as well as our new buildings. When we're building them, we're starting with this mandate that they must have a certain higher percentage of premium seats and lounges and experiences. So, those venues start with a much better return. First question, shoot again the first question. Peter Henderson : Just what where do you think -- what initiatives are sort of resonating most with the fans and driving up per-caps? And where do you think per-caps can go over time? Michael Rapino : Most of it is, I've said this before, sports, these new venues, the $1 billion arenas have done a fabulous job, the stadiums, the SoFi stadiums. They've all kind of -- we're all following the same playbook. We all probably started in a very traditional food and beverage offering, whether that was the old forum here in LA versus the new Intuit Dome, it's night and day and most of it is around having more POS, it's around having different high-end value offerings in the -- in your food and beverage bundle to both having mocktails, non-alcoholic options, higher-level food versus the traditional food. So, that's the ongoing path we see in our amphitheaters, our theaters, our arenas. We've been using this $2 per head growth over the last few years. We think that's something in the future we can continue on. So, it's all-around upgrading our current customer base, our apps. Our venues probably are the lower-end of good, great quality F&B from historic measures. So, every year, it's about upgrading that amount of POS offering, upgrading our selection, increasing our premium offering, and all of that combination, we think still has lots of runway left. Peter Henderson : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. David Katz : Hi, evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Number one, past week or so has brought quite a bit of change. I'm wondering if your thoughts have started to shift or philosophies started to shift around M&A given sort of the change over the past week? And then I have one quick follow-up please. Michael Rapino : No, we haven't, nothing's really changed in the last couple of years, the way we've been moving around the world and building our business. We don't have any sizable M&A targets that we would do with or without where the regulation stands in America. We like kind of what we're doing. You see us at an arena in Austin, at an amphitheater in some white space or a 5,000 seat, and similar around the world. We're always kind of looking in these 100 cities that are out there that want great entertainment and whether it's an amphitheater or a festival or promoter we like bolting those on and we have a big pipe of those around the world. Nothing has changed over the last two years and I don't think anything changes going forward. David Katz : Okay. Understood. And I just wanted to ask a more general question about the secondary ticketing market, which I recognize is a smaller part and in some sense a strategic portion of kind of what you do. But it seems as though every time we have something like a World Series and ticket prices get high, it just draws a tremendous amount of attention that sometimes is seems a bit misplaced toward you as the biggest. Are there any strategies or and maybe this is not the best forum to talk about them, but it's just something that comes to mind that we've written about a bit and I thought I would raise it and see if there's any answer that's appropriate here. Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think it's, go ahead. Michael Rapino : Much broader statement, but yes, we are always a little amused that sports is kind of a badge of honor how expensive those tickets go for, but music which is priced much lower than sports seems to get more of the emotional reaction. But America seems to be a market where secondary is free-to-run. We hope there's always been this hope between different legislators would get better regulation around secondary, hasn't really come to life yet around that minimum at least bots and spec selling and some of the other practices around secondary that we'd like to clean up. So, we hope over time seems to be more and more attention around the secondary market. So, we hope over time, better regulations get put in place to help the consumer. David Katz : Got it. Operator : And the final question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Peter Supino : Thanks. Hi, team. A question about Ticketmaster. With all the activism at the DOJ, a question that we've heard a lot in the last year has related to the defensibility of Ticketmaster's competitive position and one of the pillars of that is technology. And so I wondered if you could just comment on the investments that Ticketmaster is making in technology, whether it relates to bots or demand-generation or other initiatives that you think are the most important ways Ticketmaster is reinforcing and extending its competitive position technologically? Thanks. Joe Berchtold : Sure. Yes. And Peter, as you know, we spend tens of millions of dollars in capital on Ticketmaster. I think first and foremost, we need to continue to innovate the products that we offer to, on the enterprise side to our venues, to promoters, others who use the platform. Past recent years, that's included a lot around pricing technology to help everybody understand the market value of the content they're delivering. It certainly also is on the marketing side, developing great marketing science capabilities to help people market their shows. Big investments over the past couple of years on continuing to enhance our ability to handle that high-demand on-sale. We think Ticketmaster is the best in the world and we've seen a number of on-sales recently where Ticketmaster has been able to deliver a much better experience and sell tickets at a volume that others have been unable to handle. And then obviously also just on the ticket itself, all the things that we've done around digital tickets and as you said, trying to stop bots. So, range of consumer-facing technologies as well. We expect that's ongoing, right, Ticketmaster is a technology company. So, we're going to continue to be developing products on both an enterprise and a marketplace basis. Operator : And at this time there are no further questions. Now, I'd like to pass the call back over to the Live Nation management team for closing remarks. Michael Rapino : Thank you, everybody, and look forward to talking more about our business this week. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
