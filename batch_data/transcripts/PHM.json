At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup, Inc. First Quarter 2014 Financial Results Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. James Zeumer, you may begin your conference. James P. Zeumer: Great. Thank you, operator, and good morning. I want to welcome everyone to PulteGroup's earnings call to discuss our first quarter financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2014. Joining me on today's call are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller. Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that copies of this morning's earnings release, along with the presentation slides that accompanies today's call, have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. Further, an audio replay of today's call will also be available on the site later today. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. With that said, now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to speak with you this morning about PulteGroup's first quarter operating and financial results which show the company's continued gains against our key business metrics. Equally important, I am pleased to report that the positive January traffic and demand dynamics we discussed on our last earnings call continue to develop over the quarter helping to improve our absorptions per community and giving us confidence in the ongoing recovery of housing demand. Specific to the company, our first quarter pretax earnings of $130 million and related financial results show ongoing success consistent with our value creation strategy and focus on driving better returns on invested capital over the housing cycle. As Bob will detail shortly, gains related to this work can be seen clearly in our income statement and balance sheet. There are a couple of points I would note to highlight our progress. First, on comparable revenues, we were able to expand year-over-year gross margins by 580 basis points to 23.8%. Gross margins are also up 60 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2013 making this the ninth quarter in a row of sequential gains. Last time our margins were at this level was back in 2005, a time when industry volumes and relating demand were obviously much higher than what we were experiencing currently. Stated plainly, we are running a much more efficient business today as we're able to generate much higher earnings at current production levels. Second, our results show the continued benefits we are realizing from our strategic pricing strategy, which has given us a lot more opportunity to capture higher revenues and profitability for home. The average sales price for closings in the quarter was $317,000, an increase of 10% over last year. Yes, we were able to realize higher prices on our base house but as Bob will detail shortly, we saw even bigger percentage increases on option pricing and lot premiums. Again, this is reflective of our pricing strategies which focus on offering a great base house and then allowing the consumer to select those options and upgrades they value most and for which they are willing to pay. In addition to the extensive new product development and testing work we are implementing for all new floor plans, we put a lot of analysis into the options we offer and our lot pricing strategy as we work to capture the maximum value from each home we sell. And finally, I would highlight that our sign-ups for the quarter which totaled 4,863 homes. The sign-up number is down 6% from last year but it was generated from 10% fewer communities, indicating improved absorption paces within our communities, a positive sign given the strength in last year's first quarter demand. Given how demand developed and the favorable comments we have heard from our divisions during the quarter, I am really pleased with our sign-ups for the period. The combination of solid pricing, improved absorption pace and cancellation rates that dropped back below 12% for the quarter leaves me optimistic about the remainder of the spring selling season. We believe the industry is still in the early stages of what will be a sustained multiyear recovery but one that will develop at a more measured pace than passed housing recoveries given demand and supply constraints. Certainly, we could see the pace of recovery accelerate but I think we would have to see an increase in the rate of employment growth and better mortgage availability especially for entry level buyers. To that point, we get a lot of questions about the entry level buyer and PulteGroup's strategy for addressing this segment which is most directly served to our Centex brand. At less than 30% of current overall housing demand compared with historical rates above 40%, this group is underrepresented in the overall housing recovery thus far. However, we are seeing acceptable levels of entry level activity in certain markets and our most recent survey show millennials remain very positive about housing and homeownership. When demand from this buyer demographic returns, we will be ready. We continue to refine our product designs and seek new land investments that are well located to serve this buyer. We have the knowledge and financial capacity to react quickly as demand evolves and are excited about the future opportunities for the segment. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for more details on the quarter. Bob? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Thank you, Richard, and good morning. PulteGroup indeed has gotten off to a great start in 2014 with continued improvement across a number of important operating and financial metrics. These gains allow us to post a strong Q1 financial performance. First quarter home sale revenues totaled $1.1 billion which is comparable with last year. As Richard mentioned, we realized a 10% increase in average selling price to $317,000 which was offset by the 10% decrease in closing volumes to 3,436 homes. We were able to achieve this despite the difficult weather conditions in much of the country as our operating teams worked hard to minimize this impact on our production schedules. The higher average selling price in the quarter was driven by price increases at all three of our brands including 13% increases at the Pulte and Del Webb to $387,000 and $322,000, respectively, and a 5% increase at Centex to $203,000. We did see a shift in the mix of closings during the quarter which break down as follows; 41% from Pulte, 32% from Del Webb and 27% from Centex. This compares to our prior year closing mix of 46% Pulte, 28% Del Webb and 26% Centex. With our land investment continuing to skew to our Pulte brand, we expect that our mix of closings will continue to be weighted toward move-up and active adult product. For the quarter, our gross margin was 23.8% which represents an increase of 580 basis points over Q1 of last year and 60 basis points over Q4 of last year. Margins in the quarter benefited from mix of homes delivered in the period as well as our strategic pricing programs which allow buyers to select the lots and options that they value most. The success of this strategy can again be seen as lot premiums in the quarter increased 41% to $12,000 per home while option dollars gained 12% to $44,000 per home. Margins in the quarter also benefited from further reductions in sales discounts which fell for 1.6%. This is down 180 basis points from last year. In dollar terms, sales discounts in the quarter were approximately $5,200 per home compared with just over $10,000 last year. While we're likely getting to the lower end range of what's possible for discounts, we'll keep working hard to squeeze out every dollar we can. In addition to pricing benefits, we continue to focus on driving greater construction efficiency and lower build cost to our common plan and related known strategy. For the quarter, commonly managed plans accounted for 30% of closings, up from 21% in Q4 of last year keeping us on track towards our goal of 40% by the end of 2014. With rising material and labor costs, increasing the use of commonly managed floor plans is critical to our ongoing efforts to enhance margins. Our current estimates show house cost up roughly $1,400 or about 1.2% for home from 2013. As we've commented on prior calls, rising land, labor and material costs are an increasing margin headwind. We see opportunities to enhance margins from here through common plan management, strategic pricing and other initiatives. But quarter-to-quarter volatility does exist depending of the mix of homes delivered and seasonal demand. Turning to our overheads. SG&A spend in the first quarter totaled $145 million compared with $130 million last year. Our spend in the period is consistent with comments we made in Q4 and reflects investments we're making in support of common plan management, product and purchasing zones and our information systems.  Our Financial Services business reported pretax income of $22 million in the quarter which is up from $14 million in Q1 of last year. These results include the reversal of $19 million of mortgage repurchase reserves offset by a decrease in operating profitability due to the more competitive operating conditions that currently exist within the mortgage industry. We're obviously pleased to reverse a portion of our reserves related to mortgage origination exposure. This accounting reflects the improving housing market, recent settlement activity relating to known repurchase requests and the settlement of significant exposures relating to originations through the end of 2008 with a significant investor. We will continue to work diligently to minimize and resolve our repurchase-related exposures. Looking at our taxes, we reported $55 million of expense which represents an effective rate of 42%. Our first quarter rate was higher than our previous guidance of 39% due in large part to adjustments to our deferred taxes relating to changes in certain state tax rates. In the prior year, we reported less than $1 million of tax expenses, maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In total, PulteGroup reported pretax income of $130 million for the quarter which is up 58% over the prior year. Net income for the period was $75 million or $0.19 per share compared with $82 million or $0.21 per share in 2013. We've gotten off to a strong start in 2014 and are well positioned to build on this performance as we move through the remainder of the year. Looking beyond the income statement, we had 5,121 homes under construction at the end of the quarter of which 19% were spec. The spec percentage is comparable with Q1 of last year but down sequentially from Q4. During the quarter, we put 9,700 lots under control and invested a total of $325 million in land acquisitions and developments. As has been the trend for several quarters, most of these land positions are raw and require development, but we were able to increase the percentage of deals under our options would allows us to control but not own the positions until needed. At the end of Q1, we had 120,000 lots under control of which 26% are under option. Roughly 23% of our lots are finished with another 19% currently under development. As previously reported, we authorized $2 billion for land acquisition and development in 2014 and we continue to target this level. We are committed, however, to remaining disciplined in our investment process and will invest only when acceptable risk-adjusted returns can be realized. Looking at our cash flows, we generated $91 million of cash flow from operations despite the increase in our land investment activities. During the quarter, we spent $45 million to repurchase 2.2 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $19.95 per share. As of March 31, we had $190 million of capacity remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. We also completed our previously announced transactions to repurchase $246 million of senior notes. We recorded a charge of $9 million resulting from these redemptions. At quarter end, our total debt outstanding is down to $1.8 billion of which $1 billion matures in 2032 and beyond. And our debt to capital has decreased to 28%. After completing all these transactions, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash. The improvements we realized over the past couple of years in our operating and in turn financial metrics have been dramatic and are being recognized as PulteGroup has been upgraded recently by each of the major rating agencies. Let me finish with just a few more data points before turning the call back to Richard. We generated net new orders for the first quarter of 4,863 homes which is a decrease of 6% from last year. As Richard mentioned, year-over-year community count was down 10%, so we did experience higher absorption paces in the period. Benefiting from the strong price appreciation we've driven, the dollar value of sign-ups actually increased 2% to $1.6 billion. In the quarter, net sign-ups decreased 8% for Pulte, 6% for Centex and 4% for Del Webb. However, absorption paces were up 7% in Del Webb and 29% in Centex offset in part by an 8% decrease in Pulte communities. The year-over-year increase seen in our Del Webb brand is a positive given the deep land positions we maintained in those communities.  We ended the quarter with a community count of 584 which is down 10% from the end of last year and consistent with our guidance that we expect to operate from an approximate range of 560 to 580 communities during all four quarters of 2014. We opened more than 40 communities in the quarter and remain on track to open approximately 190 new communities over the full year. We ended Q1 with a backlog of 7,199 homes valued at $2.4 billion which compares with our prior year backlog of 7,825 homes at a comparable $2.4 billion value. In conclusion, our Q1 results represent a strong start to the year and are further confirmation that our efforts towards running a more efficient and profitable business are meeting with success. Now let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Thanks, Bob. As I said at the outset, we experienced good demand in the quarter with generally stable to rising prices and gains and absorption paces suggestive of buyers coming back into the market especially in March. We'll have to see how demand develops over the remainder of the spring selling season, but we are certainly encouraged by what we saw. Taking this view down a level, looking at the East Coast, sales activity was stronger in the south and softer as you move into the northern markets. Demand trends were strong in Florida and generally positive up to the Carolinas, but as you move through D.C. and into the New England area, demand was respectable but certainly not as strong as the other areas in the east. We saw a similar pattern in the central third of the country with demand in Texas arguably among the strongest in the country. Again, as you continue heading north, you can still see pockets of strength but conditions were a little more mixed. The one outlier is Michigan which continued to see good traffic and demand even in the face of the snowiest winter in more than a 100 years. Inventory is just so tight in Michigan that any available supply is quickly snapped up and often in higher prices. The west obviously didn't have to deal with snow and cold, but I think the market is still finding its level after the significant price increases experienced over the prior 24 months. On a relative basis, the Pacific Northwest and Northern California saw better demand during the quarter while Arizona felt more pressure. As for April, we are seeing stable to slightly lower traffic levels of highly qualified buyers compared to March which is a normal seasonal trend and keeps us optimistic for demand over the remainder of the spring selling season. As always, I want to thank the employees of PulteGroup as they are the people who really make this business successful. For a number of our markets, it was a tough quarter to be a homebuilder, so I want to recognize all those divisions that worked so hard to keep sales and production on track under some tough weather conditions. Thank goodness spring has finally sprung. Finally, before opening the call to questions, I want to make you aware of a press release we will be issuing later today. I'm excited to share with you an announcement we made to our employees this week that we have named Ryan Marshall to become Executive Vice President of Homebuilding Operations and Harmon Smith has been named Executive Vice President of Field Operations. Both will be reporting directly to me.  Ryan has been with the company for 13 years and Harmon 25 years. In addition to being strong operators, both have been instrumental in advancing our value creation strategy which has helped raise our financial and operating results to be among the best in the industry. And moving them into these new roles, we are aligning additional resources in direct support of value creation and allowing them to focus full time on advancing key underlying initiatives to ensure we realize the maximum benefits. Some of you may have already met with them during market tours in Florida or Texas. For those who haven't, I'm sure there will be opportunities to speak with them in the future. The press release we issue later today will provide more details on these changes and their respective backgrounds of Ryan and Harmon. Thanks for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James P. Zeumer: Thank you, Richard. At this time, we will open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Tiffany, if you'll explain the process we'll get started. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Bob, I realized you just gave us the absorptions by segments but I, truth be told I had a little trouble writing that quickly. Can you elaborate a little bit more on just the trends you're seeing and the patterns by buyer segment? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: In terms of absorptions\u2026 Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities : Yes, I mean just wanted some more color on the whole idea at the entry level, buyers challenged and move-up, active adult might be better positioned and I just wanted either some more commentary to either prove or disapprove or just discuss that whole idea? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Yes. So what we saw was that we \u2013 I'll give you the data again. On sign-up, we saw 8% decline at Pulte; 6% at Centex, 4% down at Del Webb, but our absorption paces; Pulte was down 8%, Centex was actually up 29% and Del Webb was up 7%, so absorption paces are up 4% overall. And I think that there's a couple of things happening there. Certainly the Texas market was very strong in the first quarter which is where we have a really \u2013 a larger percentage of Centex operations and so that 29% pace increase is reflective of the really strong market we saw in Texas. The Pulte market was influenced in part by Arizona where we saw a slowdown from what we saw as really, really strong results last year. And again, the highlight to us is that across the board the Del Webb product absorptions were increasing during the quarter, which is pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of years that we've said that we think it's been a little bit slower back to market for them, but we saw nice demand out of them in the first quarter. Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And then the second question just on gross margin, I think previously you talked about all else equal, the debt reduction could have added maybe a point to the gross margin expansion. With the most recent debt refinancing and some of the increase in commonly managed plan contribution, can you comment on what the updated thoughts were there? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Adam, this is Richard. The recent debt refinancing won't impact margins until '15 and '16 and beyond given the way that we amortize interest overall. So we still like our margin trajectory. As we said, there is going to be quarter-to-quarter volatility from here, but we've been real pleased with what we've been able to do. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Just to clarify, year-over-year, the margin benefit from the reduced interest cost coming through cost of sales is 110 basis points. So that 580 basis points increase in total margin, 110 basis points is interest related. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Thank you, operator. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Thanks, Ivy. Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates: One of the things you guys talked about is the common floor plan and all the success of the initiatives. Can you give us just the numbers with respect to the closing that benefited from the common floor plans and what do you anticipate over the multiple, say, next two years or so? I know you've given goals before, if you can confirm that they are on track or where you are, maybe ahead of expectations? I also think there is a lot of skepticism despite your great performance around the fact that your margin performance, gross margins specifically, is really just a result of purchase accounting from the Centex acquisition and that you've got all this old Centex mothballed stuff and it's all going to hit the P&L at some point and your runway going forward is not there as where we're optimistically viewing it. So maybe just a clarification, Bob, go through sort of the Centex legacy assets and much of which is gone from what I understand, but I think it would be really helpful especially for the bearers that are listening? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Ivy, this is Richard. A couple of thoughts. First of all, with regard to common plan management, we were at 30% of our deliveries in the end of Q1 from common plan management. That's up from 21% in Q4 and substantially below that earlier last year. We are well on track toward our goal of 40% by the end of this year and our long-term goal is 70%. So to answer that question, I would suggest that if anything we're at or slightly ahead of the pace that we projected to get to, so we feel very, very good about it and it's beneficial to the company. I'll answer the first part of the gross margin question and then throw it to Bob for more detail. Our gross margin efforts have been very, very focused on a combination of common plan management and strategic pricing actions that frankly along with mix are driving all of our margin benefit. In fact, margins on legacy land that has been around a while are in fact not benefiting from purchase accounting. They are actually a little bit of a drag on our margins overall relative to the land that we've underwritten the last four or five years. So, I would suggest for any of the bearers listening we're earning every single dollar of the gross margin improvement that we're getting. I'll just highlight again a couple of things Bob mentioned. Our discounts are extremely low and we are continuing to work those hard. Our option revenue is very high, a lot of premiums are very high and we're working on base house improvement through our common plan management work. So, purchase accounting doesn't have much to do with it. Maybe Bob can illuminate that a little more. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Yes, just for color more than half of our closings in the recent quarter are from newer vintage lands, so stuff that wouldn't have been impaired. And we actually like that land better. To Richard's point, the margins are a little bit, not dramatically so, but a little bit better and I would suggest that the land we're underwriting today, we will feel better about too. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Let's remember that the purchase accounting didn't allow us to write land down to incredibly low levels. It was market levels at the time. So we did the right accounting but that's not what's causing our margin expansion. Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Well, that's very helpful. Elaborate, if you would or ask you to elaborate on what is mothball today relative just to total company and that's not assets that you can get a return on. I know that you really changed course in your return focus and you paired down on assets that weren't going to give you that return. So for clarifications, how much of the land that you hold on balance sheet is mothball today and not going to generate the returns that would justify keeping them? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: In terms of percentage, we've got some longer life assets in the Del Webb portfolio but we've been pretty actively selling things that we don't think would generate a return over time. There was another $5 million in this quarter, several hundred million dollars over the last two or three years. So it is a small percentage of our book of what you would describe as mothballed and non-returning assets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jacky Micenko with SIG. Your line is open. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial : Hi. I got a new nickname Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: It's going to stick with you, Jack. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial : I hope not. Looking at the G&A, Richard, it picked up a little bit in the quarter. Anything behind that and I guess as an extension of that, is the Atlanta headquarter expense, is that all in the numbers? Is there anything to think about? I think that move is going to take place later this year, anything on the expense side to talk about the ratio moving up a little? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Jack, frankly, G&A came in actually slightly better than our own internal projections and very consistent with the guidance Bob gave in Q4. So, we're making some investments in some IT systems that have been needed. Our common plan management zone infrastructure to help sustain these excellent margins we're posting, we're spending some money there. And there is less than a couple of million bucks in this quarter relative to the headquarters' relocation, so that wasn't a big driver. So again, while the dollar number is clearly higher than the last year, it's well within the guidance range, actually a little bit lower than Bob projected at Q4. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial : Okay, great. I notice the (indiscernible) slide is finally been removed. I agree that issue is largely behind the industry. Can you remind us what the reserve is left after the release and was there anything \u2013 was there any specific communication with the FHFA or was it just more assumption and behavioral patterns that led to the release? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: So at the end of the quarter we'll have $102 million reserve that's after reversing the 19 million. And actually we were able to negotiate a settlement with one significant investor which prompted us to look at this during the quarter and coupled with rising home prices, which certainly reduces the exposure on individual loans. The GSEs have indicated that they are largely through their book. We've seen a decline in the current year in the number of requests \u2013 a significant decline in the number of requests that we're receiving. So on balance we looked at it and felt comfortable to release the reserve. Like we've always said, we will look at it every quarter. If there are things that happened that merit adjusting the reserve, we'll do it. We'll explain it to you when it happens. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co.: Thanks. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. The first question I had was the continued solid execution around the gross margins and you've clearly had a lot of success there. I guess as you look at the common plan management implementation, I guess you're roughly halfway through getting to your long-term goal. I was hoping if you could kind of remind us how you think about how that could incrementally benefit the gross margin from here being, I guess, in a 27%, 28% pre-interest range, if you expect any incremental benefit from here or it would be more just operational and efficiency related perhaps balance sheet inventory turn, et cetera? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Mike, this is Richard. Commonly managed plans definitely have better margins than non-commonly managed plans. So we would expect some benefit from commonly managed plans increasing in the future. Two other points to make; as Bob rightly points out, some of the elements of common plan management such as value engineering and (indiscernible) costing which we've been doing for a while are already embedded in our non-commonly managed plans. So, there's a portion of that benefit that we're not waiting to get. But the biggest point that I'd like to make is that our commonly managed floor plans are better floor plans for the buyers and the absorption rates per home, the take rates from buyers on options and things like that are better, significantly better than our non-commonly managed plans. So, in addition to getting a cost benefit we're getting a revenue benefit. And the combination of those keeps us extremely bullish to push this initiative as fast as we can. Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co.: I appreciate that. I guess it kind of leads to my second question on the absorption rate. I appreciate the additional color, Bob, that you pointed out in terms of the Centex benefit from Texas and Del Webb obviously continuing to perform nicely. As you think about absorptions on a longer term basis, where do you think that can go from here? I think a lot of the industry is \u2013 they're kind of all over the map in terms of where they are relative to history. Some are seeing absorptions back to middle of the past decade, some are still well below that, how are you thinking about that particularly as you're looking at kind of new communities that you expect to come online over the next two to three years? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Mike, Richard again. Listen, it is impossible to predict absorption paces for a community. There is just so many multiple factors that impact things. I will tell you this. I really like the land that we're buying. As a company, the disciplined investment process that we have put in place three years ago now is really benefiting us and obviously we've been focused on return on invested capital more than growth, and I think you're seeing in our numbers some of the benefits of the good land we've been buying. We have really stayed away from any B or C locations. So, how does that translate to absorption paces per community? It's hard to predict. I'll tell you we're pleased with what we delivered in Q1. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS. Your line is open. David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank : Thanks. Good morning, everybody, and a great quarter. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Hi, David. David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank : I wanted to start and maybe follow up on Mike's question a little bit, and what I want to get an idea of is I think most builders, yourselves included, are using current pace, current price, current cost when they're doing their underwriting. But given your heightened sensitivity to risk in the model and the kind of increased caution around capital allocation and focus on return on capital, I'm wondering how you think about sensitivity analysis, upside down tied especially with the volatility and pace right now, how do you think about that? If you can give us some color and maybe some specificity when it comes to trying to underwrite deals in this market which is such a choppy selling season? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: David, it's a good question and there is no definitive answer to that. What I can tell you is when we see the pro formas that our deal teams put together, we've got an asset management committee here that vets very deal. So the field will go through it and they've put comps together on what pricing is and what paces are going to be and it gets challenged. And so in markets where we have seen rapid run-ups, we actually will tend to, I don't want to say discount that but at least challenge. Is it sustainable? Maybe one of the most important factors around that is what supply is coming online around it. So if you've seen a community that's selling very well and you use that as a comp, well, gosh, is there anybody selling against them, what's going to come to market by the time we get there, it goes a little bit to Mike's question too in terms of we're looking two and three years out typically. So we really do try and flavor that into the expectations of what we can deliver. Again, it's not a \u2013 we're going to apply a 10% discount because they run up. It's more around how do we feel the markets and job creation is going to be there and then what supply do we see in the market? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: David, if I can just add a little color. This is Richard to that. We have a saying internally, stay the course and we've been staying the course and that's probably the most important thing we could do depending on market conditions is not kid ourselves about what's happening, as Bob indicated, and stick to our discipline. And I believe that's helped us continue to do the right thing with land transactions. David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank : That's great color and it's actually a good segue to my second question, because Richard you mentioned about the kind of hope that the entry levels is going to come back and trying to be positioned I think and be ready for that move when it does happen and yet the land acquisition is very focused on A locations and not B, C locations. And so I'm just trying to get an idea from a market research perspective how do you think about being ahead of when the entry level does come back. Clearly you have the product in the Centex brand, but from a land perspective, how do you stay ahead of peers and make sure you don't end up chasing those positions? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: David, number one, we're not going to underwrite transactions that don't meet our return criteria and the truth is we haven't found that many that meet our return criteria for the entry level recently. So our goal is to get ahead of it by ensuring we're challenging ourselves on what that buyer wants, how do we deliver tremendous supportability and if credit eases, be able to implement product very quickly that meets those demands. So we do have a strategy team internally that looks at future trends in each of the segments and we're working hard to understand the needs of millennials. Millennials are stretched with student loan debt. Obviously down payments are hard to come by, so I can't give you a lot of specificity on that but I will tell you we're not going to get caught flatfooted if credit eases and not have product and offerings ready to go. The goal is to stay ahead of it. The tough part is, is that going to be a year from now, two years from now, when does that buyer return more meaningfully? We don't know but the point was we'll be ready. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG : Thanks. First question I wanted to ask was about kind of following up on Dave's question there. Centex brand doing well in Texas, so is that a reflection of first-time buyer demand reemerging maybe locally just in Texas or is that kind of a reflection of the historical positioning that Centex was the Texas brand, so maybe Centex might skew a little bit more \u2013 move up in Texas? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Nishu, I'd say it's a combination of those two things plus a very strong economy in Texas. Texas economy is adding jobs. Houston's the biggest housing market in the country now. I recently did a tour in March to all of our Texas markets and was amazed at the activity going on in all four of the major metro areas with just the overall economy. So I think a combination of strong economy, our legacy position there and an emergence of the entry level category there, but largely fueled because of the strong economy. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG : Got it. And second question, the new EVP positions you highlighted and congratulations to Ryan and Harmon on those. Is that a reflection of the success you've seen with some of your operating strategies, the common floor plans and efficiency in production? So is that kind of a formalization or recognition of that or does that tell us that there are major new directions you're going to pursue and therefore these positions reflect more of that? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Nishu, there are very clearly focused on adding incremental resources to what we've already been pushing, so definitely not signaling anything new. But candidly we've had a very flat structure for the past four or five years and despite all the gains that we have made, we believe there is more to go there. And Harmon and Ryan are exceptional operators that have been very involved in all of the value creation work and delivered great results in their respective geographic areas. So we're bifurcating the roles, if you will, where Harmon can help us focus on pushing each of the field operations to drive out additional benefits and Ryan's role kind of overseeing our homebuilding operations, sales and marketing functions in the company will be derived around capability development to help us further enhance some of the things that we've been working on. So very much staying the course but more horsepower behind it, if you will. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joel Locker with FBN Securities. Your line is open. Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Just on your backlog conversion rate going forward, do you expect it similar, say, just in the second quarter to the 53% you guys reported last year? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Joel, this is Richard. We won't give any guidance on that but I'll tell you we don't have many specs, so we have a very healthy backlog, a very strong backlog and it's just a matter of getting those homes delivered but to add to that with incremental specs converting is not going to happen because we don't the specs. So, read into that what you will. We're very, very focused on a bill to order model and it's benefited us in many, many ways, so we're committed to that. Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc.: Right. And also on your amortized interest that fell I guess around 70 basis points sequentially, I think 440 down to 370. And that kind of got down further faster than I expected and what do you expect going forward to \u2013 I mean you think that level is going to stabilize there, that 370 basis points or do you see maybe up or down going forward? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Yes, we don't give commentary on margins by quarter. What we did indicate is the total expense for the year would be down about $50 million or $55 million from last year. It doesn't come in straight lined during the year, it comes in based on closing volumes. So you'll see a little bit more expense in margin quarters that have higher closing volumes. But again, call it 205-ish million we're thinking for the year in terms of total expense. And to Richard's comment earlier, the activity that we did in the first quarter of this year doesn't move the needle on current year interest. That would be out years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open. Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I wanted to follow-up actually on the management change question. Can you talk a little bit about how you see the structure of Pulte going forward on the homebuilding side as different or distinct from the kind of management structure you had on the homebuilding side sort of pre-crisis, if you will? I know that things have obviously gone through a lot of changes. I imagine you probably learned some lessons and some things you don't want to replicate and I was curious as to what you thought those things were and how we might be able to look at what you're doing today as being consistent [Technical Difficulty]? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: \u2026we think we have a long way to go to kind of push to where our vision is. And then those are kind of the primary responsibilities for Ryan. With regard to Harmon's role, again, very, very focused on having the field operations report to him and digging into all the opportunity areas that I've been able to dig into frankly over the past four years myself. But we still see lots of pockets of opportunity and my role has been fairly broad, and we need to get a little bit more incremental focus on some of the areas to take it to the next level. So all this signals is stay the course with additional very, very well respected and highly qualified individuals to lead these efforts. So relative to the long term \u2013 the past structure that the company has had, I don't think it's all that similar. We still have a very flat structure in the company and we're likely to keep it that way. Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital : Okay, great. Well, I'm certainly looking forward to following up there with them. You made a comment about absorptions being up 29% at Centex, the Centex subdivision. I'm very curious about how much of that can be explained by Texas alone or if you were to ex-Texas out, did you still see Centex communities performing better on an absorption basis and are you looking to increase the number of Centex divisions or subdivisions that you're going to be opening up as a result of this? Just trying to understand how you process that outperformance and absorptions at Centex? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Stephen, as we highlighted, it was \u2013 the largest driver of that was the Texas market where we happened to have a lot of Centex communities. I candidly haven't done it ex-Texas but I would suggest that it was up across the board but I don't know that percentage. We can probably get that for you. In terms of opening new communities, our investment in land has been \u2013 we've talked about 75%, 80% Pulte of the 9,700 lots we put under control in the first quarter, less than 10% of those were Centex lots. So I wouldn't expect a large flood of openings from us, because we just don't have the land to do that. As Richard highlighted, we think if we see whether it's in specific markets or more broadly, a move towards that buyer becoming more active, we think we can get on the lots pretty quickly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East with ISI Group. Your line is open. Stephen East - ISI Group Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, and congratulations, also, guys. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Thanks, Stephen. Stephen East - ISI Group Inc.: Richard, you all are really the only one in the industry that can move their gross margin significantly from internal things you all are doing at this point. If you look at the external market, what do you think that's giving you right now? It's gotten significantly tougher particularly out west and that type of thing. Has your strategy needed to change any? Do you need to be tighter with pricing or looking forward, I guess, I'm wondering are your incentives going to have to move up at least because of what the markets demanding and that type thing? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Steve, listen, we're not immune to the market vagrancies that happen around the country. So I don't want to imply that our business is not subject to the overall broader trends. I will tell you this, we have shattered some internal assumptions around what can be done in any different component of pricing and frankly cost. And so as a couple of folks prior to you on the call here have indicated, don't underestimate the impact of what the things that we're doing internally can do and we're continuing to work hard on those. So, I would suggest we do have an ability to drive efficiency in our business that's significantly greater than we have in the past. That will be offset some by headwinds. Bob indicated some numbers on pricing and labor costs and what have you that are up. But look, I like where we are. I tell our teams internally we should feel really good about where we are because we've earned our success. We haven't just relied on the market improvement that lifts land values to lift margins like we used to, quite frankly. So, feel good about that with some offset that makes us subject to market conditions. So hope that helps. Stephen East - ISI Group Inc.: Okay, that does. And then if you look at monthly, you gave some idea of what was going on. As you've looked at this year, has it unfolded \u2013 including into April, has it unfolded from a monthly perspective in a typical fashion? And then you had in prior quarters you had talked about still metering sales, et cetera. I'm guessing based on your performance you didn't \u2013 that's probably starting to dissipate out there if not gone away completely. And along with that on the Del Webb, are you getting \u2013 you've talked about pricing power. You've got the highest margins there. Do you see this as a driver of your margins, the primary driver of your margins moving forward? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: So you snuck in three or four there honestly. Stephen East - ISI Group Inc.: I did. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: See I caught that. So, listen, a couple of things. With regard to metering paces we are still metering paces in some markets. A good example would be Northern California which is red hot and a few other markets. I think directionally you're right. Probably we're not metering as much as we were but frankly we could have posted more sign-ups in the quarter had we wanted to kind of let it run. But where we already have a six or seven or even eight-month backlog that didn't seem to make a lot of sense for us given the way we're running the business. So, we feel like we're operating the right way. With regard to Del Webb, we're excited about what's happening in Del Webb. As Bob indicated, the overall focus for the company given how much land we have for Del Webb has been very, very positive and I do think that's a positive for us overall. However, I would just point out as Bob indicates, our overall margins are up a similar amount for each of the brands and the reason I highlight that is that's driven outside of market vagrancies. That's driven from common plan management, from focus on discount, from focus on lot premiums. I mean the numbers Bob gave you on options and lot premiums we're very proud of. Those were things we were not paying attention to like we should have four or five years ago. So, hope that helps overall. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Roxland - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks very much and congratulations on a very good quarter, especially given the backdrop. Given the slowdown in Arizona, what steps are you taking to address that, if any? And excluding Arizona, how did the Pulte brand do? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: So a couple of comments on Arizona. Arizona is clearly not as strong as it was. But I tell our people given the total volume and margin we're driving out of that market, it's still a very good market. Frankly, I would suggest that our land positions there are very well located. Our teams have done an excellent job. And while we've certainly seen some softer conditions in Arizona, it's not a bad market or one that we're concerned about. We're actually quite happy with our overall performance there. So I'd just point that out. I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question? Michael Roxland - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : If you exclude Arizona, how did the Pulte brand itself do? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: As Bob indicated, absorption paces were down. We were hit a little bit with weather conditions in the Midwest, in the Northeast where we have quite a bit of Pulte brand. But we were pleased with our overall efforts on the Pulte brand. I'm sorry, I don't have a specific number for you if we exclude Arizona. Michael Roxland - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, that's fine. I appreciate all the color. And then just a last question on the community count, obviously it increased to 584 this quarter. I know Bob you mentioned that you're still looking at 560 to 580 for the duration of the year. What occurred during 1Q such that you exceeded your own expectations with respect to key community count? And should we expect really community count growth to be at the higher end of the range that you've indicated in the last couple of quarters? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: No. Again, we still feel comfortable 560 to 580. It's really the vagary of when does a particular community close, when does a particular community open. Again, this isn't a signal of something structurally different in our community count. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Good morning, Ken. Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Given the success that you're demonstrating in the common plan, I wonder if you consider replacing since you took it out of your put-back side with one that kind of traps your landed vertical costs. And if you would even perhaps comment on that on a year-over-year sequential basis how the land is changing given that you are highlighting other factors like lot premiums, et cetera. But I think the core vertical versus land if you'd comment on your opinion talking about that? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Listen, I appreciate the suggestion. We are trying to do our best to give as much color as we can around that with so many different factors that move the needle, but point taken. We are clearly not relying just on land appreciation to drive our margins. There is a lot of internal effort that's going on there. So, Ken, we'll take that under consideration. Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: It's a very clean way to prove your point. Second, could you comment on Arizona? I think there is obviously a lot of one-off things occurring there. But to the extent there was once a distressed MSA, can you comment why you think that might not be a precursor for what might happen as other distressed markets get more existing inventory back? Florida, obviously, with different foreclosure processes is a very different stage of the game. It's not our view but if you can kind of address why you think it would not be a precursor for inventory pressuring new home sales in other markets? Thank you. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Well, I don't see a lot of excess inventory coming to the market in a lot of places. There was a fairly rapid and focused land grab, if you will, in Phoenix 24 months ago when that market started heating up and a lot of that supply is there today. When we talked to our operators around the system, we don't hear of a lot of inventory coming into the market in any specific market overall. Obviously, it's a function of demand versus supply. But I'm relatively comfortable that we're not going to see a lot of other markets with a lot of supply there. Ken, if I could just reiterate a comment I made a minute ago. Arizona is still a very good market for us. I know a lot of folks have written about the softness in Arizona, so to speak. But I'll go back to something I mentioned earlier on this call. We're buying the right kind of land in the right locations where buyers want to be. And I wouldn't suggest we're immune from the overall vagaries of that market, but we are posting exceptionally strong margins and good sales paces if not phenomenal sales paces like we were 24 months ago. So at least for our business, we're pretty happy with Arizona. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets : Hi. Good morning. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Hi, Bob. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets : I wanted to ask you guys, your average order price is up nearly 9% which is terrific and you have actually manageable comps going forward. Do you think that kind of pace is sustainable in the current demand environment going forward for average order prices? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Bob, it's hard to say. You can calculate what kind of a backlog is. It's going to depend a good bit on mix. Bob's comment on Del Webb is going to be important there to the extent that Webb continues to accelerate. That's a positive for us obviously given the ASPs that we drive there. It's hard to predict. I really wouldn't want to comment on that just because who knows exactly what's going to deliver in a given quarter and what the demand environment is going to be. So I don't know, Bob, if you've got any other color of that? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: No, I think that's exactly right. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, understood. One question on the balance sheet. I know you guys have done a great job of managing towards driving return on capital higher and debt to capitalization now is the lowest it's been in a very long time at 28%. You've got a lot of cash on the balance sheet, 1.3 billion. What's the longer view of how you see the balance sheet in two to three years and what do you want to do with the cash? Thanks very much. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: So let me start out and then ask Bob to comment more specifically. I think we have demonstrated that we want to be balanced with our capital. And I wouldn't expect that to change going forward. If you go back, history would say that putting all of our investment into land is not necessarily the best thing for our shareholders. I think we've learned that and you can continue to expect us to be balanced overall and frankly, I think we demonstrated in Q1 all four aspects of capital that we could \u2013 all four aspects of spend we could put our capital toward with increased land spend, obviously a dividend continuing to buyback our own stock as well as repurchase debt. So, I suspect more of the same. I know that's not a lot of specific commentary. Bob, anything else you'd like to mention there? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: No. I think you got it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse : Thanks very much. Was wondering if you can talk about \u2013 you talked about the absorption based on the different brands, that's very helpful. When we think about the strength in Texas and the Centex lower price point and what that means, do you think there's going to be any impact on margins as you move forward from that? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Dan, it's a good question and I'll remind everyone that our main focus is return on invested capital. Obviously, we're happy with our margin focus. But we'll handle it and be happy to underwrite a transaction with a 30% return and an 18% margin as an example. So, it depends on what happens with that category overall. It is a category, generally speaking, that has generally higher turn characteristics and lower margin characteristics. But given what Bob indicated in terms of the overall land investment that we have, I think our results for the next period that we can view are going to be largely driven by what's happening with Pulte and Del Webb. Centex, clearly, is having an impact overall, but I don't know that it will move the needle a whole lot one way or another in the short term. Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse : Got it. Okay. Thanks. And I guess the other question is just could you provide some great color in terms of the cost per home in terms of the very modest increase there (indiscernible). As you sort of look at the land that's likely to flow through, how do you look at sort of the land cost on a per home basis and what is likely to come through this year? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: We haven't commented on that historically and I would tell you we highlight that land costs are going up but I think that's true for everybody. What we have highlighted is that margin performance in fiscal '14 will be better than fiscal '13. You saw that in the first quarter. Our margin in Q2 was 18.8 to 20.9. Our backlog visibility would suggest margins closer than what we thought more recently. So I think you'll see improvement there. And Richard just highlighted pricing, so you can I guess backend into the lands done. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eli Hackel with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thank you. Just wanted to go to a comment you made at the end of your prepared remarks just on April. I think you just said \u2013 at least a little clearly for me, so I just wanted to understand what you were trying to say with April as regards to your optimism for the rest of the spring selling season? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Yes, Eli, what we said was that the traffic levels are slightly down from what we saw in March and we said that's the normal seasonal trend where we typically see traffic peak in March and then trail off a little bit through the rest of the selling season. So we said \u2013 our comment was we are seeing a normal spring selling season unfold which leaves us optimistic for the balance of the year. That's what we said. Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Great. And then just one quick one. What was the comp rate in the quarter? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Just under half. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Yes, just under 12%, 11.5%. Operator : I would now like to turn the conference back over to our presenters. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Great. Thank you very much. I know there is a lot of conference calls queued up this morning, so we're going to stick to our scheduled time. We're certainly available for any follow-up questions or emails. Thank you very much for your time on today's call and we'll look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup, Inc.\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference. James P. Zeumer: Great. Thank you, operator. This is Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations for PulteGroup, and I want to welcome everyone to our call this morning to discuss our second quarter financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2014. On the call today to discuss our results are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller. Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that copies of this morning\u2019s earnings release, along with the presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call, have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. Further, an audio replay of today\u2019s call will be available on the site later today. Please note that today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup\u2019s future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Thanks, Jim and good morning everyone. I\u2019m extremely pleased with PulteGroup\u2019s second quarter results, which show a continuation of a positive company and industry dynamics we discussed as part of our first quarter conference call and more broadly over the past 12 to 18 months. Within the U.S. housing market that remains on a steady recovery path, we are benefitting from company\u2019s specific initiatives that continue to generate gains and key financial metrics, consistent with our value creation strategy. Reflecting with an ongoing recovery and demand, and overall favorable pricing environment, the value of our second quarter signups increased by 5%, as we once again realized the improved absorption paces over last year, we see these as positive signs for our business going forward. As Bob will detail among the promising aspects of these gains, it is a meaningful increase in the performance of our Centex communities and the implications for potential future demand among entry-level buyers. It has been widely reported that the first time buyer has been underrepresented in this housing cycle. So improving demand at Centex communities is a very encouraging sign. We also realized the solid increase in sales pace within our Del Webb communities. As we have talked about before, there is tremendous operating leverage to be realized with volume, so continued gains in Webb\u2019s absorption pace is important. Within this demand environment, we continue to focus on maximizing profitability on each norm we sell. Consistent with this strategy, we realized a 12% increase in average selling price over the last year, along with favorable market conditions on our ongoing mixed shift, price gains were generated through specific pricing strategies that address everything from base house and option pricing to lot premiums and discounts. Each is a dial; we can adjust to accommodate biogroups and local market conditions to help us achieve our goal of higher returns on invested capital in each community we operate. For the better price realization and initiatives to drive more efficient ongoing operations, we were again, successful in raising reported gross margins. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin for the second quarter increased by 480 basis points to 23.6%. In fact, we have to look in history books all the way back to 2005 for these type of margins from PulteGroup. We are of course, pleased with the improvement in gross margin that we have been \u2013 we have generated in 2014, as well as over the past several years and see opportunities to continue the strength going forward. Through a combination of pricing strategies, gains in operating efficiency and savings associated with lower interest costs, we see the potential for incremental gross margin improvement from here. An insurance related charge taken in the quarter makes the year-over-year gains in our homebuilding operations a little harder to appreciate when you see earnings of $0.11 per share, up a $0.09 per share last year. However, when you adjust for the charges taken in both periods and the more normal tax rate in 2014, the meaningful and sustained improvement in our homebuilding operations is clear. Given the gains we have realized in operating and financial performance, we are comfortable increasing our level of investment into the business, confident that we will be able to generate better returns on invested capital that we were delivering in the past. roughly 400 million of land spend for the quarter and 720 million for the first half of 2014 is the most we have invested in a number of years. The increased investment is possible given our more efficient homebuilding operations and strong balance sheet, and it\u2019s consistent with our view of an ongoing recovery in housing demand. So our headwinds facing the housing industry including type credit availability, and in our view, the negatives are outlaid by the positives, such as the monthly jobs reports showing an economy generating more jobs than it had in the recent past. Interest rates remaining low, even a lot of that continues to withdraw support from the system and inventories of new and existing homes remaining imbalance with reports about an under supplier product in some areas of the country. These conditions in content with a good pricing environment and continued increases in apartment lease rates, support our expectation for a continued albeit measured recovery in housing demand. Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for more details on the quarter. Bob? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy:  Thank you, Richard, and good morning. PulteGroup\u2019s second quarter results demonstrate further success operating against our value creation strategies and driving improved operational performance and financial results. As I will detail, these improvements are evidence in our Q2 numbers. Looking at our income statement, wholesale revenues in the second quarter were $1.2 billion, which is an increase of 2% over the comparable prior year period; the higher revenues for the quarter were driven by a 12% increase in our average selling price to $328,000, partially offset by a 9% decrease in our closings to 3,798 homes. Consistent with recent quarters, we realized price increases at many of our communities and within each of our brands. For the second quarter, the 12% average increase in selling prices included a 13% increase to $396,000 in our Pulte communities, a 9% increase to $325,000 in our Del Webb communities and a 3% increase to $202,000 in our Centex communities. We continue to experience a shift in the mix of homes closed to move-up and active adult product.  : Our reported gross margin for the quarter was 23.6%, which represents a gain of 480 basis points, compared with last year. Our margins benefited from the higher prices and mix shifts, I noted as well as lower interest cost. I think it\u2019s important to highlight that we believe our margins are being enhanced by our strategic pricing model, which seems to maximize lot premiums and option dollars within the final selling price of the home. We continue to realize gains through this initiative as lot premiums and option revenues per closing in the second quarter increased by 23% and 14% respectively to $12,000 and $47,000 per unit. Also supporting the expansion margins was a reduction in sales discounts, which dropped 90 basis points from last year to 1.7%. In dollar terms, discounts were only $5,700 per home, down from $7,900 last year. We\u2019ve highlighted that we don\u2019t expect discounts to decline significantly from these levels. Along with capturing pricing opportunities, we continue to expand our use of commonly managed plans to help insure that we\u2019re building the best home for the lowest price. In the second quarter, 39% of our deliveries were from commonly managed plans. This is an increase from the 30% we reported in the first quarter. We\u2019re extremely pleased with our progress on this metric as we have grown this percentage from just 13% one year ago. We are clearly on track to meet or exceed our goal of 40% of our closing from commonly managed plans by the end of 2014. Given the benefits of commonly managed plans, a favorable pricing dynamics were experienced in the market and the impact of our deleveraging the balance sheet over the last few years. We continue to see opportunity for further margin expansion from here although there will be volatility from quarter-to-quarter. Based on our current backlog, we expect the margins for the balance of the year to be consistent with that\u2019s slightly higher than our margin this quarter. SG&A costs for the second quarter were $230 million, or 18.4% of home sale revenues, compared with $151 million, or 12.3% last year. The year-over-year increase in SG&A was primarily driven by a charge of $84 million, reported in the quarter for increased insurance reserves. The adjustment to our reserves was driven by costs associated with siding repairs in certain previously completed communities in the west. Beyond the direct cost of the repairs, the negative development in the period to use the insurance filing impacted our actuarial estimates for incurred, but not reported for potential future claims, the combination of higher costs incurred and the resulting increase and estimates for future expenses throughout the second quarter charge. Repairs are in process in the impacted communities and we\u2019re working with homeowners and contractors to ensure the work is completed efficiently, and with minimal disruption to the residence. Excluding this charge, SG&A costs in the period were consistent with expenditures in Q1 of this year and with previous guidance. Financial services reported pretax income of $9 million for the quarter, compared with $16 million in Q2 of last year. The reduction in pretax income for the period was the result of lower origination volumes and the more competitive operating conditions that continue to exist within the mortgage industry. Capture rate for the period was unchanged from last year and consistent with Q1 of this year mortgage put back request remains at very low levels. Inclusive of the $88 million in charges for insurance and office relocation costs, pretax income for the second quarter of 2014 was $58 million. Prior year pretax income of $38 million included charges totally $67 million for contractual dispute, debt repurchases and corporate relocation. As you can see, our operating performance excluding these items was significantly improved. Income tax expense for the period was $26 million, or an effective tax rate of 38%. This is consistent with our previous guidance and taxes in 2014 would be approximately 39%. Prior year tax expenses only $2 million, or an effective tax rate of only 5% that the company is yet to reverse deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Net income for the second quarter was $42 million, or $0.11 per share including $0.14 per share of charges recorded in the period. For the second quarter of 2013, net income was $36 million, or $0.09 per share, including charges of $0.17 per share. Again, this year\u2019s net income reflects the 38% tax rate, compared with the 5% rate last year. Looking at other operating metrics, we have 6,321 homes under construction of which 15% were spec at the end of the quarter. Spec reduction is consistent with prior year and prior quarter, but particularly important; however, finished specs sold less than 300 houses, or well below one per community. During the quarter, we put 6,700 lots under control and invested $395 million in land acquisition and development. we approved more deals in the quarter than we have in any quarters since 2006, including the approval of three new communities to serve future active adult buyers, continuing recent trends about three quarters of the deals are raw meaning that land development is required. So these transactions will support production in 2016 and beyond. We had 126,000 lots under control at the end of the quarter, of which 26% were controlled via option, 24% of the lots under control are finished, and we have another 18% under development. At $395 million for the quarter, our land spend is clearly increasing. For the year-to-date period, we have spent approximately $720 million. We continue to target a full year land spend of $2 billion for 2014, or recognize it will be a challenge to spend an additional $1.3 billion over the next six months. As we\u2019ve highlighted before we are comfortable with this, we continue to invest in a disciplined manner with a focus on better located positions and acceptable risk adjusted returns. It\u2019s important to note that we continue to see good opportunities, as evidenced by the level of spend we approved during the second quarter. along with our higher land investments, we have also increased our repurchase activity in Q2. In total, we acquired 2.8 million shares for $53 million, or $19.12 per share. As of June 30, 2014, we had $137 million of capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. I would also highlight that we entered into a new three-year $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility yesterday. the revolver, which includes an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the facility to $1 billion, replaces a letter of credit facility that have set to expire later this year and provide data financial flexibility for the company. Moving past our financial statements, the dollar value of signups in the quarter increased 5% over the last year to $1.6 billion. On a unit basis, net new orders totaled 4,778 homes, which is down just 2% from last year, despite a 6% decrease in community count. As Richard highlighted, this is the second quarter in a row where we experienced higher absorption paces. Looking at this by brand, net signups decreased 1% at Pulte, and 5% at Centex and 2% for Del Webb. Q2 absorption paces were down at 8% at Pulte, but up 11% at Del Webb and 26% at Centex. A 26% increase at Centex solves a 29% improvement in year-over-year absorptions in the first quarter of this year, certainly part of the increase is driven by the overall strength of demand in Texas. but the trend in Centex weren\u2019t close monitoring and there may be a growing opportunity with the entry-level buyer. We ended the quarter with 589 communities, which is a decrease of 6% from the end of last year. Q2 community account was flat with the first quarter of this year and in line with guidance that we expected to operate from approximately 560 to 580 communities throughout 2014. The stability across the headquarters hides a fact that this is a very active year, which we plan to open approximately 190 new communities over the full year. Our quarter end backlog with 8,179 homes valued $2.8 billion, which compares with prior year backlog units, and dollars of 8,558 and $2.7 billion respectively. The average price of our homes and backlog is up 7% over the last year to $339,000 and up from $336,000 in Q1 of this year. Overall, I am extremely pleased with our results for the quarter even more encouraging our improving absorption paces with better pricing, growing margin and increased investment put us in a very strong position moving forward. Now let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Thanks, Bob. As Bob just detailed we continue to experience strong buyer demand in the quarter which generated increased absorptions and allowed us to realize higher selling prices. While we appreciate that housing data can be volatile from month-to-month, we\u2019d remain optimistic about overall conditions and very encouraged demand through the first six months of the year. Looking at conditions in the second quarter on a more regional basis, on the east coast conditions didn\u2019t changed all that much in the first quarter this year. In that activity was stronger as you move from the north to the south. Buyer activity remains particularly strong in Carolinas, and throughout the State of Florida. Market conditions in Washington DC however were still challenging in the quarter. Conditions in the middle part of the country were positive in the second quarter, similar to our experience on the East Coast demand strengthened as you move from north to south. Texas remains one of the strongest areas of the country with exceptional demand across all markets of Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio. Relative to the first quarter of the year demand conditions got better as we move past the tough winter. Finally, moving to our western markets the patterns of the past several quarters continued as we experienced strong demand in Northern California and Pacific Northwest, well our markets in the Southwestern states of Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada are good, but not as strong as this time last year. As the U.S. economy continues to improve we would anticipate that these markets will benefit. In terms of demand for the first few weeks of July, we have seen the typical summer slowdown, but the market specific trends we experienced through the first six months of the year are generally unchanged. In closing my thanks to all of our employees who are working extremely hard to help us drive our improved operating results and we are doing an amazing job opening 190 new communities this year. Thanks for your time this morning and I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James P. Zeumer: Anastasia: Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities : Thanks, good morning everyone and nice quarter. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Thanks, Mike. Michael Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities : The first question I had was your comments on Centex and the continued positive sales pace, you mentioned part of it was driven by Texas and I just wanted to get a sense of its sales pace was up in the other regions where Centex is more dominant or how much really Texas was responsible for this and part of this is \u2013 is just a reformulation or mix benefit from some newer communities as well? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Yes, Mike this is Richard. It\u2019s a combination of Texas and other markets, to be clear the entry-level does appear to be improving in other markets as well. We happen to have the biggest percentage of Centex communities in Texas, and as everyone knows the job growth in Texas is strong that\u2019s why we highlighted, but it appears to be a broadening improvement for the entry-level categories? Michael Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities : Okay. And just secondly the gross margins continue to be great and you\u2019ve showed a lot of improvement there, one of the competitors this morning mentioned that they\u2019ve maybe taken some actions to improved sales pace in the market, which might suggest a modest negative impact on gross margin. Is this something that you think might continue going forward and kind of spread to the industry or have you seen this from a competitive standpoint \u2013 by other builders or in certainly other markets? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  Mike, we are definitely to run on the company for the highest returns on invested capital and we are not pushing discounts as a matter of fact, as Bob indicated discounts drop year-over-year to an incredibly low level, while lot premiums and option revenue increased. So, I can\u2019t speak to what competitors are doing? I am not seeing broad-based discounting across the board. I think inventory levels candidly are too low and I would point out that the very strong quality land, that we have been buying the land several years, along with our return strategy is supporting our higher margins. As Bob indicates we expecting to continue. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman with Zelman and Associates. Your line is open. Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Associates :  Good morning, guys. Congratulations on another strong quarter. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  Thanks, Ivy. Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Associates : If you could just please talk to a little bit \u2013 with the charge reserves on the $90 million for the siding, this is completely separate from the construction defects that you reserve for few years ago. And, just understanding making sure that separate, and then, my follow-up is just as you thinking about the mortgage competitive, mortgage environment. What are you seeing more in terms of lenders willingness to maybe remove some of the credit overlays. As you deliver loans to Fannie and Freddie is the consumer actually seeing a better price as a result for the competitive pressures and maybe more specific within the credit buckets, recognizing that you are typically dealing with the better quality borrower, but you\u2019ve also indicated the Centex, this is picking up, so is that a function and also lending improving to that bucket. Thanks and congratulations again. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  Okay. Thank you. So, Bob do you want to take the first part. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy:  Sure. So the charge IVY is for siding issues and it is construction defect work. So, we are repairing siding issues that we have identified and the mechanics of this are, we\u2019ve got certain communities where we have costs and then looking at the actuarial analysis. When we saw that activity the actuaries look at that and say okay, if we see it today, we have to extrapolate across the universe of production. So, it is actually both specific to certain communities siding issues and then a extrapolation for incur but not reported plans. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  Okay. And then, Ivy, with regard to the mortgage environment, I would say credit appears to be easing just on the margin on the edges if you will, I do believe that is some of the improvement in the entry level, I do think however, the majority of the improvement in the entry-level is job growth related. I don\u2019t think credit has moved much, but it appears to be easing just on the edges, we\u2019ve seen a very slight increase in credit availability as measured by MBA in their statistics. Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Associates :  Great. Thanks, guys. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  Thank you. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy:  Thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS Investment Bank. Your line is open. David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Investment Bank :  Thanks, guys. Good morning. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  Good morning, David. David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : My first question, I want to follow-up on one of the Bob\u2019s comment earlier about kind of where, what\u2019s happening in the Centex business segment and the higher absorption rate and the trend, keeping an eye on the trend. What I am trying to get an idea is, what\u2019s the trigger points for you guys to start maybe focusing more land acquisition on Centex communities? Is that you hit a certain absorption paces is a certain confidence in the economy. What are you looking for when you are examining that trend and the improvements you are seeing to get more confident in your land acquisition in that segment? Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy:  The simple answer is as you heard Richard say it is return, so as we look at land transactions in the market, that the teams are agnostic to brand and so they\u2019ve got opportunities to invest in any one of our brands. And so I think what would drive increased investments in Centex is a continuation of the pace increases if you are seeing here, because it still has lower ASP\u2019s, still has lower margins. And so we need higher paces, so it would be that improving environment for the buyer and Texas is a great example that job market there is really strong, Richard highlighted this, strong jobs are driving consumer confidence and that buyer is therefore buying in more volume and so you would see us invest more in that land when we see that activity. David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Investment Bank :  That\u2019s great color. My second question was on the three new active adult communities that were I think put under contract you mentioned earlier in the commentary. Can you give us just a kind of high level are these replacement communities for things that are rolling off, these incrementally and what might be different or maybe the same about those relative to the existing Del Webb communities if you kind of look at the rolling off and rolling off pattern? Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy: Great question, these are largely the replacement communities there is one that is a fresh community, what I think you see different from the historical Del Webb is they are smaller they range and size from 600 units to 1,200 units, we think we will be in and out of them and say five years it will have a slightly smaller aminity package to what I \u2013 you probably heard me refer to as the crew shift Del Webb, if its continuation on an existing community it may have of shared aminities but typically, we had a club house it might not have a golf course any more, it will have walking trials. So again a little bit smaller and I think we\u2019ve talked about this for a couple of years those 5,000 unit communities are likely not featured, Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: David, everything Bob mentioned, is all driven around return its all part of the Pulte story. David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Investment Bank :  Great, thank you guys. Nice quarter. Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from Eli Hackel with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eli Hackel \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to go back to the first time buyer and credit for a minute or so, Richard you talked I maybe think using on the margin, is there anything else you can see over this next six, nine months whether its conversations in the industry with your mortgage trends with people and do you see or maybe that change more, maybe that would change more incrementally and then also on the first time buyer. Do you think there is any holdback of them buying due to lack of available supply in the market so it\u2019s really much more back to your first one which is really job growth accelerating within that core buyer? Thank you. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  Yes. So I will answer and a reverse Eli, I think the majority of a problem is a combination of tight credit and jobs the combination there, overall, I don\u2019t think there is a lack of supply for that category, I think the industry can ramp up to build for that category, on there is certainly some supply shortages but the majority of the issues I believe are tight credit and jobs. With regards to credits potentially easing from here mortgage finance reform legislatively is likely dead for this year as I think everyone knows the job\u2019s in (indiscernible) didn\u2019t make it too far in congress, so we are working as a group of collective large builders to push the administration particularly to work on administrative solutions to the credit box, which we do believe can have some impact that would be things like changing FHA fees things like that. Unfortunately, that\u2019s the sometimes tough to get done and I do believe that will take sometime, but by clarifying a put rules by insuring that the definition of qualified mortgages and qualified residential mortgages is very clear by focusing on FHA fees, things like that we do believe there is some administrative actions that know what could take, as he heads up FHFA would be outside of legislative arena. And we are working on that, we are not holding our breath at, anything is going to happen dramatically to help that. It\u2019s going to take sometime for credit to years in my view. Eli Hackel \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Great, thank you very much. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen East with ISI Group. Your line is open. Stephen East \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: Thank you, good morning guys. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Hi, Stephen. Stephen East \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: Richard you talk a little bit about the July rebound or is it July being pretty normal seasonally and we\u2019ve heard from various places that June absorptions were down like 15% across the industry et cetera. Could you talk about how your order progression was during the quarter and whether you saw that type of absorption drop in the quarter? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Yes, Steve. We saw fairly seasonal typical trend. And April and May were stronger than June. We didn\u2019t see a dramatic fall off in June it was very typical summer seasonal which is continued into July. Stephen East \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: Okay. And then we\u2019ve also heard over the last three or four months that generally traffic it\u2019s been much better than the conversion into orders, I was wondering if you all were seeing that and then if I could just ask one question back on the gross margins. Can you help me reconcile a little bit the commonly managed four plans jump from 30% to almost 40% that the gross margin stayed about flat? How do we reconcile those two and is that going to be an ongoing thing there. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Okay, I\u2019ll take it crack it both and then maybe Bob might want to add any color. On traffic versus conversion, we are continuing to see good traffic and conversions respectable I would just again say within the balance of a typical summer slowdown. So not a lot of movement Steve either way on either metrics I would say we still had good traffic and respectable conversion both marginally down given the summer season. On gross margin performance the commonly managed plans or better margin product and we are excited about the 39%, but many things go into the margin performance including specifically mix for the quarter. And we have indicated that we would have quarter-to-quarter volatility, our margins even though they were sequentially down I think about 20 basis points they continue to be at a very high range and as Bob indicated based in our backlog we see opportunities in next couple of quarters in them to be in this range or slightly higher from here. So we\u2019re pleased with our overall margins and mix influences things from quarter-to-quarter. I don\u2019t know Bob any other color. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: I only things I want to add is, one things that we\u2019ve highlighted about these commonly managed plans that we think is sort of the hidden gem, is that our absorption paces are higher with them. And I think its contributing to the absorption pace increases you are seeing from us, which is equally as important to return for us the margins. Operator : Your next question comes from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America :  Thanks and good morning. First question I wanted to ask was about the profile of land spend, you folks mentioned that you approved the most number of deals I think in, since maybe and going back to the housing boom, but at the same time you also said that $2 billion land authorization, it will be tough to get there. So I was just trying to reconcile those two, does that imply that, you\u2019ve shifted your land purchases towards much longer deals, where the cash flows are more back end weighted or is that, just a reflection of the fact that the trajectory of housing this year is probably turned out to be a little bit slower than most of us originally expected. Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy:  Yes, I would actually characterize it is that the change to a certain degree in what we are buying, there isn\u2019t much finished lot availability out there. So we\u2019re buying raw land, and so while our dollars out the door today, it will be a challenge to get the $2 billion; we\u2019ve actually committed a fairly significant amount in terms of what will develop in 2015 and 2016. So you\u2019ll see spending increasing in out years because of what we\u2019ve done this year. And we think we\u2019ll get close to the $2 billion, we are just not sure we\u2019ll get all the way there. And it\u2019s because we\u2019ve continued to tell our folks don\u2019t chase deals. This is you\u2019ve got authorization to go spend money, but don\u2019t do it foolishly. And so the discipline that they are exhibiting is going to make it a little bit of challenge to get the $2 billion, but you\u2019ll still see a significant increase over fiscal 2013 and we like the land that we are buying. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Nishu, it\u2019s Richard, I want to add two things what Bob said. Number one, we are seeing some delays in entitlement and municipal issues which candidly or somewhat out of our control just based on processing times to get things through the cycle and that\u2019s causing some of the delay. And secondly, I want to be crystal clear, we are not lengthening the land supply in a profile of the deals we are doing as a matter of fact. We are doing our best to make them strong returners, which generally means a little bit shorter positions clearly than the company is buying in the past. So there is no change in our profile over the last two or three years that we\u2019ve been indicating ROIC first. Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America : Got it. Great. And kind of following up on that, 190 new communities I think you mentioned I think you\u2019ll be opening this year. So a significant amount of turnover as well as accelerate pace of taking land under control. So do we begin to see a more significant pace of community comp expansion in looking into 2015? Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy: Nishu, we haven\u2019t commented on that yet, and we are sticking with our guidance of 560 to 580 for this year and as we get closer into either late Q3 or Q4 we\u2019ll provide some guidance for 2015. But it\u2019s too early for us to speculate on those numbers. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open. If you are on mute, please unmute. Stephen Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital : I\u2019ll apologize for that. I was muted. Thanks very much for the color, the quarter, interesting about the entry-level would set to see where that goes. I wanted to ask you a question about labor and the ability to construct homes, particularly I\u2019m interested we all know that labor shortage is that been something that the builders have talked about for kind of while and obviously there is cyclical cycle reasons associated with the severity, the downtrend that have made labor and particularly short supply. My question is, is there \u2013 is it more difficult or more easier to get labor to build your entry-level product versus some of your higher end products. And specifically what I\u2019m getting, do you see a recovery in the entry-level demand? Do you anticipate that labor shortages will constrict your ability to meet that demands with product? Or is it because or could it be that because entry-level homes don\u2019t maybe required the same amount of finished skills, trend and so forth that actually you can take some lesser skilled labor and still get those homes build at the entry-level? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Steve, we\u2019re not seeing any difference in labor availability for entry-level versus a more luxury focused product for us. I\u2019ll say labor is tight in the industry particularly for unskilled trades, drywall, looping and things like that. And clearly there is some constraint on ability to close backlog in the near-term; it\u2019s just a timing issue. So you may have units moved from one month or one quarter to another. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big problem for the industry, but it could cause some minor disruptions frankly not unusual from past recoveries, but no not a lot of change in segment availability of labor. Stephen Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay, that\u2019s encouraging, great. And then you made a comment in your prepared remarks about land and I just want to make sure that I got the numbers. You mentioned I think that 24% of your lots were finished. I wanted to make sure I understood was that the owned, 24% of owned lots or 24% of your controlled lots. I want to know how many owned finished lots you have? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: It was controlled Steven, and we\u2019ll see if we can get that number for you. We had 24,683 finished owned lots. Stephen Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital : Thanks. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Which would be 27% of all finished lots we have. Stephen Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital : 20% of all\u2026. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: All right, 20% of all owned lots. Sorry. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Good morning, Ken. Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Richard you talked about approvals impacted, you commented on approval process impacting your land spend. Could you comment on what the discipline side i.e. your returns says about what land prices are in various markets, this is my first question. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Yes, Ken, we\u2019ve certainly seen a significant escalation over the past 12 months to 18 months in land prices; they do appear to be moderating to some degree. However, I would tell you that the discipline that we are exhibiting with a very capital constrained focus internally to drive higher returns continues to lead us toward challenges to meet the overall lands and goals that we have. As Bob indicated we hope to get to the $2 billion level, but we are not going force it. So overall we are pleased with our discipline, we think it served as well, we think it\u2019s one of the reasons that our margins have held up as well as they have. And frankly one of the reasons our paces are doing well simply because of the quality of the land we are buying. So continued more of the same I would say is in our future. Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Okay, and than my second question broadly related how you are running the capital structure. Could you give us a sense of what you think the company will do, if your revenues are growing let say 10% or X%? What is the cash flow cycle imply about your yield or your free cash flow generates the potential, the buyback stock as you did \u2013 as you did in the quarter given that you are not going to be a cyclical on the capital investment cycle. Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy:  Yes. It\u2019s a great question, Ken and as a company, we continue to \u2013 we think to exhibit balance with our capital allocation strategy and I think you can expect more of the same from the company, we reintroduced the dividend last year to a reasonably nice level and we stepped up our share repurchases in Q2. And so I would expect the company to continue to exhibit balance. Now that our returns were strong as they are, our first priority will be to put it in the business. But candidly, we don\u2019t want to delude our returns. So we want to make sure that we\u2019re buying the right lands. So I think it\u2019s fair to say, we\u2019re going to have plenty cash available to do a multitude of things, and I would suggest that continuing to return funds to shareholders through dividend and buyback is likely in our future as part of our balanced process. Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Right. And I guess, if you think about invest in the business like you said, and you\u2019re going to be holding land and let\u2019s say two-year. How do you gauge your discipline relative to what you want to invest today, based upon where you think the market is going to be because that\u2019s the real thing, right. We have two-year, 50% growth, that\u2019s different than a steady 10% or 15% growth which will yield us different element of cash flow? Thank you. Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, I think it\u2019s tough to predict that on the future too far, Ken. I would suggest for the near to medium-term, we like the conservative pasture that we\u2019ve taken and we\u2019ll, we realize that the large cash balance is a non-earning asset and we\u2019d like to deploy it, we just don\u2019t want to do anything dramatic or sudden to try to tie in the market if you will. So stay tune for further clarity and commentary on that as the picture become little clear in the future for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning guys, a nice quarter. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  Thanks, Robert. Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hi, Robert. Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC : How much \u2013 what\u2019s your upside do you think there is gross margin, the standardized floor plans have been fantastic, very positive impact. Do you still see opportunity for upside? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Bob, we indicated for the next couple of quarters. We see things in this range are slightly improved. Beyond that long-term, we don\u2019t want to provide a lot of guidance, we certainly like the benefit from commonly managed plans, we like our discipline, but I\u2019ll highlight something that Bob indicated is certainly a nice margin story and we want to keep it going, but it\u2019s about return for the company. So we\u2019re going to continue to make good decisions based on return overall. So we like where margins are headed for the foreseeable future. Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC : That\u2019s helpful. You\u2019ve been in the homebuilding industry for a long time. Do you think we\u2019re transitioning from early cycle to mid cycle of the recovery? If you could just kind of give us your view where we are in terms of the evolution in that process? that would be great. Thanks. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Yes, I think housing has several good years ahead. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re mid-cycle yet, frankly in my view. But I do think it\u2019s a slow and steady path upward from here, I\u2019d like to tell our folks internally my best projection is that I don\u2019t see anything causing a sharp increase in overall demand, nor do I see anything causing a sharp decrease in demand. I think a slow and steady recovery is the most likely one, which is kind of what we\u2019ve seen. There are a couple of headwinds that we historically might not have had in housing recovery, such as job growth that is good, but not great anti-credit, but the same token, those things appear to be getting better slowly, but surely. So that would be what I would expect. One other thing Bob just mentioned is that the recovery now appears to be taking on regional and local geographic characteristics, which is very typical of a normal housing recovery. I think we transitioned probably late last year, or early this year from the sort of macro view, or housing was horrible for several years, and then we had a couple of years where housing was really good everywhere. Now, it\u2019s becoming much more about local economies and local geographies, and that\u2019s normal. So as we indicated, Texas has got great job growth, and it\u2019s strong and DC has got social job growth and it\u2019s not as strong, that feels normal to us. So again, to summarize slow and steady from here is my best guess for many years. Operator :  Your next question comes from Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Adam P. Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC :  Hi, thanks for taking my question. Richard, in the last couple of questions, you\u2019ve mentioned returns a lot, I was wondering if you could, in one particular, you said returns are strong now. So I just wondering if you could be even more specific and talk about what you\u2019re referring to whether it\u2019s something margins, or if it\u2019s ROEs, or ROICs and what \u2013 where you are versus where are your targets and what might be achievable? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  Yes. We are clearly focused internally on our invested capital. So, it\u2019s ROIC that I\u2019m referring to, and all of our folks in the field I\u2019ve been running the business. this is the fourth year in a row, with a focus on a combination of margins, SG&A leverage and asset turns. And if you kind of put that in the triangle, right in the middle of it, we\u2019d kind of stamp ROIC. so we feel like our returns are very strong today, and we feel like we can keep them in this range, or higher from here. We don\u2019t think that our balance sheet is completely being utilized. In other words, we still have a number of lots that are long positions. and as we cycle through those, and we replace them with more term friendly deals. I think that can help the denominator, and obviously, we\u2019re working on the numerator as well. So, it\u2019s hard to predict where returns can go, but we intend to be a high return in builder through the cycle, certainly, not as higher returns in the down cycle, as in the up cycle. but we want to be focused on returns from here on now, because we do believe that metric is the most important metric to drive shareholder return over the long run. Adam P. Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC :  Okay, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. Operator :  Your next question comes from Will Randow with Citigroup. Your line is open. Will Randow \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for taking my question. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  You bet, Will. Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hey, Will. Will Randow \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Hey, in regards to your land spend, are you guys kind of augmenting that towards Texas and Georgia versus some of the stronger markets. I think we are seeing, I don\u2019t know if you are as well? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  We actually focus our investment on a couple of things. One is to maintain relative market share and the markets where we operate. The other is obviously where we see the opportunity for increased investment. So it will be a function of how well they\u2019re investing today. We don\u2019t say okay, if we\u2019re going to invest 100 in total ex-percent goes here, here, here, it\u2019s static. It actually moves over time. so certainly, the improved operating environment in Texas is one that has interested in investing more. So they have a fair amount of capital. But we are trying to maintain relative market share in all of the markets where we operate. Will Randow \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Thanks for that. And then just in terms of, on the balance sheet, give me some of credit metrics, do you intent to refinance your 2015, 2016 maturities from Centex. and I guess overall is your goal being investment grade, or is it just more than returns on capital? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on individual debt offerings. What I will tell you is that there are very, very expensive. So as we look at all of our debt over time, if we were to make an investment to buy it back, because we can get some positive yield out of it, and that\u2019s a challenge with some of the pricing that we\u2019re seeing on our paper. Sorry, I forgot the second question. Sorry, Will. Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy: We\u2019ll come back to you, Will. Operator :  Your next question comes from Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Jay C. McCanless \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. First question, what was the [cap rate] (ph) in the quarter? Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy:  14.1, so flat with last year. Jay C. McCanless \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Okay, great. And then my second question in a little different take on the lands, can you comment on the valuations you\u2019re seeing in private builders who are willing to sell, and all those valuations in line with what you\u2019re looking forward with the right strategy and could you potentially go out and do some deals and buy some of these private builders to accelerate that land growth that you\u2019re talking about and then is that two building target this year? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  Certainly, we see all the transactions that are coming out, the stuff that gets announced, we see these. And I would say the answer is, yes we could potentially be doing transactions, but we\u2019d look at them as typically just a land transaction. So we are putting the same return requirements on them as we are on any particular land transactions in a market. Oftentimes, when people come to market, they\u2019ve got fairly lost the expectations for price. We haven\u2019t seen anything that was compelling to us to chase, but that doesn\u2019t mean we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 we look at them and we\u2019re interested, we\u2019re a buyer and seller of land, it\u2019s part of the equation here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Krapfel with Morningstar. Your line is open. James Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar Research :  Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So using your risk-weighted focus on ROICs, ultimately, where do you see options as a percent of total land under control long-term and how long do you think you\u2019ll get there? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  Jim, we\u2019d like to drive option desires we possibly we can. we\u2019ve been really pleased with our ability to do so, given our focus on returns. to some extent, that can be dictated by the seller, in some instances, it\u2019s not available, but Bob, if you have any more color on that. Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add to that is options can take on different looks and feels. If you\u2019ve got a finished lot option transaction, it\u2019s different than one where you\u2019ve got raw land where you\u2019re optioning partials of it, as you go forward. And for us that can extend it to what generates the best return risk-weighted. So if we are buying raw land, the option \u2013 we want the option to have risk transfer elements to it, whereas if you\u2019re buying finished lots, it\u2019s a little bit simpler to work through. So what we\u2019ve been doing now, we are increasing our percentage of option transaction. but again, they are typically raw, where you may have a 600 lot community and we take the first 200 down and option the second 200. James Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar Research :  And on the finished land side, the options of finished land. When do you think you could start to do that to a greater extent? When will the developers regain those naturally held to do those kind of deals? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  All right, that\u2019s a great question. And I don\u2019t know. James Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar Research : Okay, next\u2026 Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: I haven\u2019t seen it to a large extent at all today. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Dan M. Oppenheim \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Thanks very much. I was wondering, it\u2019s great kind of confidence that you talked about in terms of the gross margins during the back half of the year, is that flatter or slightly up. Just wondering about that how much that is the view that the \u2013 what you\u2019re doing internally in terms of the common plans and the price optimization is offsetting on the slower home price appreciation and from a high land cost. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: Yes, Dan, I think it\u2019s all of the above, I\u2019ll will tell you, I\u2019m very pleased with our internal focus on commonly managed plans and don\u2019t rule out that the stats Bob keeps given each quarter around lot premiums and options those are \u2013 and discounts, our internal focus on isolating each of those metrics and trying to optimizing them helps. So it\u2019s clearly a combination of all of the above when you have as many moving parts as we do going in it\u2019s hard to isolate it to anyone, but collectively that\u2019s what where we get. Daniel Oppenheim \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great, and second question you talked about the strong absorption on the Centex side, but then in terms of pricing with Centex it was up less, (indiscernible) achieved in terms of more (indiscernible) lower price points at first to pushing price less in Centex than in many other brands. Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy:  Yes, certainly our operators are trying to get price for ever they can, they are also trying to get return and so phases get to there. It\u2019s interesting we were talking earlier, yes the Texas market had outsized first time absorption increases but the non-Texas markets were up 13%. So of that 20 plus percent pace increase it\u2019s not just Texas. So the return characteristics are not so much in that business about generating higher prices be with that buyer is somewhat limited to the down payment they can come up with. So paces what actually replaces it and we\u2019ve seen that across all our markets in this quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East with ISI Group. Your line is open. Stephen East \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: Thank you. Just want to follow-up Richard and Bob a little bit on the cash generation et cetera. As you sit here and look this year and this year and next year before your debt pay down and you repose given the big land spend what do you expect, you should go through on the cash generation side for this year and next. Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy:  We haven\u2019t given any color on next year, obviously we\u2019ve been absent debt transaction dividend the share repurchases were going to be cash flow generative this year and substantially. So lot of it will depend on how much of the land spend we actually get done and then how much we allocate to share repurchases. Stephen East \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: Sure, okay. If Richard\u2019s scenario were sort of a slow and steady I mean is it rationale for us to think 215 cash generation before those other issues with sort of be on the similar track. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.: : : Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy: And certainly we will be \u2013 a tax there, next year. So our earnings stream is cash consistent with this year. Operator : Your next question comes from Buck Horne of Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open. Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates: Thanks, I appreciate \u2013 the question. I wanted to ask a strategic question because you got good presence with the entry level brand you\u2019ve got to the move-up brands, you\u2019ve got the active adult segments, have you given consideration to moving further upstream whether it\u2019s the second time move-up, we\u2019re taking a full bigger push into the luxury market, have you considered expanding your brand options? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  Buck, we\u2019ve talked about it, and this is Richard. We\u2019ve talked about internally and we think the Pulte brand allows us to expand up nicely. as a matter of fact, we have several communities operating in the 6\u2019s and 7\u2019s, and even a couple over a million with that brand just fine. So one of the things we\u2019d recognize is that even though, the margin and return characteristics in that segment are very strong and good, they typically represent above 10% of the total housing market plus or minus. So we think we can serve that very effectively with the Pulte brand. Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates:  Okay. so you wouldn\u2019t think you need to make an acquisition outside of the company to try to establish a different presence or different brands? Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  That\u2019s correct. We have enough experience with the Pulte brand and with construction techniques, design et cetera that we believe we can stretch that name into that category. but again, we want to be selective, we like the fact that we are diversified with our portfolio. Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates:  Okay, thanks. Richard J. Dugas, Jr.:  Thank you. All right. I apologize, Will, I remember your second question and it was about the rating agencies and investment grade. it is certainly the business that we\u2019re running; we think certainly, warrant consideration for investment grade. we\u2019ve shared that our thoughts on that with the rating agencies. The one thing I would say is it\u2019s not the overarching reason we do things. So, again, we think we actually warrant consideration for investment grade today and we\u2019re running the business in the way I think that is supportive of that type of ratings. But it doesn\u2019t mean we wouldn\u2019t look at doing things differently if we thought it was better for shareholders. Operator :  There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer. James P. Zeumer:  Great, thank you, operator. I know you have a lot of other calls to be held today. So we\u2019ll be available to have any follow-up questions. Thanks very much for your time and we look forward to speaking with you on the next quarter. Operator :  This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Inc. Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And Mr. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference. James P. Zeumer: Great. Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. I want to welcome you to PulteGroup's earnings call to discuss our third quarter financial results for the 3 months ended September 30, 2014. On the call today to discuss PulteGroup's results are Richard Dugas, Chairman and President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jim Ossowski, Vice President and Financing Controller. Before we begin, I want to alert all participants that copies of this morning's earnings release along with presentation slide that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. Also posted to the website is the second release we issued this morning announcing a 60% increase in our quarterly dividend and the $750 million increase in our share repurchase authorization. We will also post an audio replay of today's call to the website a little later. Please note that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. This risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now with that said, I like to turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard? Richard J. Dugas: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I am once again very pleased with the strong earnings and operating results PulteGroup reported this morning. A 29% increase in year-over-year pretax income and bottom line earnings of $0.37 per share reflect our relentless pursuit of operational improvement. We continue to work on a series of key initiatives, which are improving our fundamental business metrics in support of driving better long-term returns on invested capital. In a few minutes, Bob will review the details of our third quarter results, which demonstrate the operating and financial progress we continue to make against our goals. I'd like to take some time on this call to discuss the other release we issued this morning on dividends and share repurchases. For the past several years, you've heard us talk about our Value Creation strategy and our focus on driving better margins, overhead leverage and inventory turns. If you have been monitoring our results, you can see PulteGroup's relative performance on these metrics go from middle of the pack or even bottom in certain instances to among the industry leaders. The work we've done these past few years has clearly driven meaningful company-specific gains beyond any market lift the industry has realized since the housing recovery started in 2011. The critical next stage, which investors have been asking about, has been on the company's plans for future capital allocation. Beyond the more than $1 billion of cash we carry and related very strong balance sheet, investors see our operations continuing to grow more profitable and more capital efficient. These trends and the fact that PulteGroup won't be a cash taxpayer for several years, point to the potential for continued strong cash flow generation going forward. Based on these facts and trends the time is right for us to better define our capital allocation plans for the future. We will discuss these plans in much greater detail at our December 9 Investor Day here in Atlanta, but the basic components are as follows. First, to invest in the business to drive higher return on invested capital. Next we have increased our quarterly dividend to enhance the cumulative returns of our shareholders and finally, going forward, we plan to return available excess capital to shareholders routinely and systematically through share repurchase activity. Looking at our investment philosophy, you may recall that prior to implementing our Value Creation strategy we allocated capital almost exclusively into the business to acquire the land needed to support aggressive growth. We got the volumes about our expensive and heavy land pipeline hindered returns on invested capital and created outsized market risk. Among the many lessons learned from the last housing boom is that there are paces and rates at which you can effectively grow this business while still generating high returns. Exceeding those rates for multiple years in a row put significant stress on a company and can encourage an organization to take on excessive risk. We believe shareholders are not well served by doing either. So today, having fixed our balance sheet and improved our overall returns on invested capital to be above our cost of capital, it make sense to continue to increase our investment in land. In 2013, we invested $1.3 billion into land acquisition and development, which is an increase of 30% over 2012. In 2014, land investment will likely be up another 40% or more over 2013. And given our expectations for a sustained albeit gradual recovery in housing demand, we have authorized a land spend budget for 2015 of $2.4 billion. This is an increase of $600 million to $700 million of our expected 2014 expenditures for land acquisition and development. Notwithstanding our positive outlook on the market, we are steadfast in our view that we need to remain balanced and return funds to shareholders over the cycle. Having established the level of investment we want to pursue, we consider the form and size of the routine systematic returns of funds for our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This morning's announcement of a 60% increase in our dividend and a $750 million expansion of our share repurchase authorization is a direct reflection of this discipline. We've said from the start of the housing recovery that we expected a slow, measured improvement in buyer demand that would play out over a number of years. We have probably been more right than wrong in this forecast. Our forecast which we continue to support and now we are articulating our plans for capital usage throughout the cycle. From a demand perspective, I am pleased with what we saw over the course of the third quarter, as absorption paces improved for the third quarter on a row and our expectations are for sustained growth and demand going forward. We will, however, keep a watchful eye on the issues ranging from recent stock market volatility and interest rate fears, to fighting in the Middle East and health concerns developing in the U.S. to see if they impact consumer confidence going forward. More broadly, our view of the U.S. market remains positive, as continued improvements in both the economy and employment provide ongoing support to an industry that continues to benefit from low inventory, low-mortgage rates and favorable demographic trends. Further, we are encouraged by proposed changes at FHFA, which have the potential to improve mortgage availability, particularly for first-time homebuyers. Regardless of how the macro environment evolves, I feel really good about where we are as a company and how we're running the business. With the 134,000 lots under control, $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet, a gross debt-to-cap ratio of 28% and a disciplined capital investment process, we are in a great position to further improve our returns and the returns we generate for our shareholders. I think it's important to stop here and thank the employees of PulteGroup, who have been instrumental in putting us in such a strong position. Their efforts have allowed us to successfully execute our long-term plans while delivering the day-to-day actions needed to run this business. They are an amazing group of people. With that said, let me turn the call over to Bob for more details on the quarter. Bob? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Thank you, Richard, and good morning. The 2 press releases we issued today, demonstrate the ongoing benefits we're realizing by operating our business in alignment with our long-term Value Creation strategy. As Richard indicated, we realized strong year-over-year gains across a number of critical areas in the business. Before I get to the details, let me remind everyone that as we highlighted in this morning earnings release, we acquired certain real estate assets from Dominion Homes in August. In connection with this transaction, we gain control of 8,200 lots in the Columbus, Louisville and Lexington markets and assumed 622 Dominion Homes in our backlog. During our 5 weeks of ownership, these assets contributed 64 sign ups and 86 closings from 33 active communities. Looking at our income statement, home sale revenues in the third quarter increased 4% over the prior year to $1.6 billion. Our higher revenues were driven by an 8% or $24,000 increase in our average selling price to $334,000, partially offset by a 4% decrease in closing volumes to 4,646 homes. The increase in average selling price was driven by an 11% increase in ASP to $410,000 in our Pulte communities, and a 6% increase in ASP to $322,000 in our Del Webb communities. The average selling price of $204,000 in our Centex communities was essentially unchanged from the prior year. Our mix of closings by brand was consistent with the third quarter of last year, with 46% coming from our Pulte communities, 30% from Del Webb and 24% from Centex. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter was 22.9%, which is an increase of 200 basis points over the third quarter of last year. Our margins continue to benefit from higher average selling prices, lower interest costs and gains from our strategic pricing programs, which focus on maximizing revenue opportunities within lot premiums and home options. Lot premiums in the third quarter increased to 11% or approximately $1,200 over last year, while option revenues per closing increased 15% or approximately $6,500 versus last year. There's been a lot of market commentary relating to the potential for the industry's increasing use of incentives in certain markets. I'm pleased to note that we have not seen significant pressure to increase incentives in the majority of our markets. In fact, sales discounts in the quarter actually fell by 8% to just under $5,700 or 1.7% per house. We know there's a lot of focus on gross margins and while our margins are up 200 basis points compared to last year, we recognized that they're down 70 basis points from the second quarter of this year. Approximately 30 basis points of the decrease was driven by closings from Dominion's backlog, which carry very low margins because of acquisition accounting adjustments. The remaining decrease in sequential margins is due primarily to unexpected costs associated with the closeout of certain legacy communities, and a modest unfavorable shift in the mix of homes delivered compared to the second quarter, partially offset by a reduction in interest expense. It should be noted, that closing out the remainder of the Dominion backlog will continue to weigh on our reported margins for at least the next 2 quarters. The margin impact could be in the range of 50 to 100 basis points each quarter depending upon the volume and mix of units closed in each period. Beyond these short-term impacts, we continue to realize efficiency in sales pace benefits with commonly manage plans, which accounted for 45% of deliveries in the third quarter. The closing volume from commonly managed plans is up from 39% in Q2 of this year and we're now slightly higher than our year-end target of 40% for 2014. SG&A costs for the third quarter were $147 million or 9.5% of home sale revenues compared with a $139 million or 9.3% in the third quarter of last year. At $147 million, SG&A expenses for the period are consistent with previous guidance. Financial services reported pretax income of $11 million for the quarter, which is comparable with last year's results. Capture rate for the period was 80%, which is unchanged from last year and consistent with the first half of this year. For the third quarter, Pulte reported pretax income of $225 million, which is up $50 million or 29% over the $175 million of pretax income reported last year. Our income tax expense for the period was $84 million, which equates to an effective tax rate of 38%. In the third quarter of 2013, we reported a tax benefit of $2.1 billion relating to the reversal of substantially all of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Net income for the third quarter was $141 million or $0.37 per share. Last year's DTA reversal makes the EPS comparison hard to assess, but given the 29% increase in pretax income, we're extremely pleased with the progress we continue to realize in our financial results. Looking beyond the income statement, we had 6,865 homes under construction, of which 18% were spec at the end of the quarter. As a percentage of construction activity, this is consistent with prior year, and our finish spec inventory totaled only 335 homes, which remains well below 1 per community. During the quarter, we put 16,165 lots under control, half of which are related to the purchase from Dominion. Our third quarter investment of $525 million brings our total year-to-date land acquisition and development spend to $1.25 billion. As occurred last year, it's likely that we will not get our entire authorized spend targeted at $2 billion for 2014 invested this year and that will -- we will be closer to $1.8 billion for the year. This would represent a 40% increase in investment over 2013. And as Richard commented, our land acquisition and development investment authorization for 2015 has been set at $2.4 billion. I would point out the development and entitlement delays continue to grow more pronounced, which is impacting our ability to get money invested. Having said that, we want our divisions to remain disciplined and not force investment into the system by reaching for deals or taking on incremental risk just to get a contract signed. While deals are taking longer, the profile of the projects we put under contract has not changed. Consistent with our recent quarterly updates, roughly 75% of the transactions we entered into during the quarter are raw, which means additional time and dollars will be required to bring the communities online. We also continue to see the best return opportunities in projects targeted toward move up and active adult buyers. So the lion share of our investment was targeted toward these consumer segments. At the end of the quarter, we had 134,000 lots under control, of which 36,000 or 27% were controlled via auction. We continue to look for opportunities to auction rather than own assets, where such a structure allows us to enhance returns and or reduce risk. Of the 134,000 lots under control, approximately 23% are finished. During the quarter, we also paid a $0.05 per share dividend and repurchased 2.7 million shares of our stock for $50.3 million or $18.85 per share, in addition to the investment in the business. This brings our cumulative share repurchases since reactivating the program in July of 2013 to 14.9 million shares or 4% of our shares outstanding for $266 million or $17.82 per share. Even after having spent more than $600 million during the quarter on investment and return to shareholders, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash. We recognized that having $1.2 billion nonreturning asset is not advantageous. Today's announcement about our dividend and share repurchase authorization, in addition to stepping up our land investment in 2015 demonstrate our commitment to putting this capital to appropriate use. Moving on to sales activity, the dollar value signups in the quarter increased 3% over last year to $1.3 billion. While net new orders were essentially unchanged at 3,779 homes. Signups increased 8% at Pulte and decreased to 11% and 3% at Centex and Del Webb respectively. Aggregate absorption paces were flat during the quarter. However, if you exclude the 5-week impact of the Dominion assets, absorption paces were up 5% overall. Looking at this by brand, Centex and Del Webb communities increased 8% and 23% respectively, offset by a decrease of 4% in our Pulte communities. It's worth noting that our Del Webb community count was impacted by the close out of several selling positions since last year. Regardless, we're pleased by the stronger paces we continue to see within this brand. The ongoing improvement in our Centex communities continues to be an encouraging sign in terms of potential future demand. We finished the third quarter with 600 communities, which is comparable to last year's 604 communities. And we ended Q3 with a backlog of 7,934 homes valued at $2.6 billion, which is up from 7,522 homes valued at $2.4 billion last year. Now, let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments. Richard J. Dugas: Thanks, Bob. We were generally pleased with the overall level of demand experienced in the third quarter, but depending on the market, we did see a little more volatility from week-to-week. On the East Coast, we continue to see stronger demand in the southern markets and particularly in Florida and the Carolinas. The DC area showed some improvement as the quarter progressed. But demand conditions remained below expectations as you move further north of the Coast. Third quarter demand in the Midwest were generally positive, with ongoing strengthen in Michigan, Indianapolis and Cleveland. We're excited about the opportunities we see to improve the operating results we realized from the Dominion assets along with building out our position in these markets going forward. We have a strong experience team in place, so I am confident about the execution. Texas remains one of the strongest areas of the country, but we did see the market starting to ease a little from the torrid pace they have been setting. Out West, Southern California, Las Vegas and Phoenix picked up in the quarter, which is a positive sign. Northern California was little more volatile from month-to-month. Demand through the first few weeks of October has followed the usual seasonal pattern, with some uptick coming out of September, but with a little less consistency from market-to-market driven by local market dynamics. What we're also seeing from market-to-market is varying degrees of strain on the local trade basis, which are at times struggling to keep up with the current pace of production. It is likely that tight labor resources will create production challenges in the industry for the foreseeable future. In closing, I want to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. Taken together, I think this morning's 2 releases say a lot about the company and the strategies we are executing against. You see continued strong operating and financial performance supported by a more disciplined capital investment process working together to drive improve returns for our shareholders. I look forward to seeing you at the December investor meeting, where we can discuss these topics in greater detail. Thanks for your time this morning, and now I'll turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. James P. Zeumer: Great. Thank you, Richard. Before opening the call to questions, I do want to alert that -- investors that registration to attend our December 9, Investor Day, will open up Monday October 27. We will issue an email announcing the online registration is active and as space is limited, I'd encourage interested investors to sign up promptly. Now we'll open up the call for questions, so that we can speak to as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. [Operator Instructions] Jonathan if you will explain the Q&A process, we will get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Stephen East with ISI Group. Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : I really like what you're doing on the capital allocation side and could you talk more about that the decision process that you went through the criteria that you're looking at when you do it, what you think about the future capital allocation? How you look at the cap structure throughout the cycle just sort of the whole process that you went through? Richard J. Dugas: Sure Stephen, this is Richard. I'll make some comments and then Bob can take you through a little bit more about how we're looking at the balance sheet. We've studied this very carefully, frankly over several years. And had really I think done our homework with regard to the entire housing cycle over a long history and frankly what we believe is that returning funds to shareholders through a very disciplined manner overtime is the best path toward total shareholder return and value creation for shareholders. So what you see is a little more formalized pronouncement of our strategy. We've obviously been operating the business with a view toward high returns for several years now, and the results I think are evident. Now we're just trying to be a little more explicit about additional return of funds to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase activity. So that's how we looked at it and our December 9, Investor Day, is going to get into frankly a lot more history and detail on how we came about these ideas, but maybe Bob you could explain a little bit about the balance sheet and what we're looking at there and then cash. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Sure. We -- as we look at this -- we -- it will hinge off of leverage to a certain extent. So you heard us talk about in the past that we want to or we're comfortable with 40% leverage. You can expect us now to target leverage between 30% and 40%. That's not a hard-and-fast rule if there's a particular transaction that makes sense we might go above or below that, but the guiding post for us will be 30% to 40% leverage overtime. And so then as we looked at it the first priority is always what are we going to invest in the business. You heard our commentary on what we're going to do for 2015. The goal obviously being to drive higher returns. So now that we've-- are actually earning above our weighted average cost of capital, we'd like to improve that, so returns have be accretive to that on investment in the business. At the same time, we want to be balanced. We talked about this too. The dividend, I think you can expect us to target a yield between 2% and 3% overtime. It will be important to us that we have the confidence that we can deliver that through cycle. So we've started I think the yield based on yesterday's close with about 1.7%. So if the market is feeling good, it's always subject to Board approval, but you can expect to see us increase that 2% to 3% overtime. We always want to be cognizant that M&A activity is available to us and we still look at it as land transactions, so Dominion is a very good example of that. And then what we'll do is as we look at our projected cash flows, capital structure again, targeted 30% to 40% leverage ratios, if we have money available beyond that in any period of time, we would seek to buy back stock with that. It's important to note that we're not actually looking to time the market on that. So you would see us put plans in place that are meant to do that ratably over a period of time. Those plans will be reactive to market pricing, so if there's dislocation I think we'd accelerate somewhat, but again it's not designed to say we're making a call on the equity value today. It's we're returning shareholders to -- money systematically and routinely as Richard said. Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. I really like the plan that you all are laying out on that. And just to follow along on the land spend side, you started ramping up your spend, you're still sort of in a catch-up mode if you will as far as getting new communities open as the others burn off. As you look at the $2.4 billion for next year what type of gross community count do you expect and how is that compared, what you think will be rolling off? Richard J. Dugas: Yes, Steve, this is Richard. We're going to give some guidance on that number at our Q4 call as our budgeting process is kind of underway now. I think it's fair to say the increased investment at some point in time will yield community count growth, but we're not prepared to kind of get into that today, as we're still finalizing the numbers for next year. Operator : Your next question comes from Jack Micenko with SIG. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Bob, the margin guidance this piece of Dominion is 50 to 100 each quarter, is that incremental or is that also sort of the run rate, how do we think about that next couple of quarters? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Yes, so what that does is it incorporates. We assumed 622 homes in their backlog, which because of acquisition accounting will be ascribed very low margins. We're just saying that mix of business in our total will drive our margins on an aggregate basis down between 50 and 100 basis points. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay, great. And then, Richard you said in October there was some volatility region-to-region, can you talk about maybe -- where maybe demand was little better versus maybe a little not as good? Richard J. Dugas: Yes, Jack, we're not going to comment on specifics with regard to October, but it's candidly not a lot different than we saw in Q3. If you noted in our release, Florida was particularly strong, the Midwest was a good market for us. We saw some improving conditions in the Southwest and then a little bit weaker versus frankly probably unsustainable pace in Texas in the quarter, and then Northern California started to show a little bit more volatility. So what we're trying to indicate about October was that we saw a typical seasonal uptick coming out of September, but we do see some volatility week-to-week just based on all the world events. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I have 2 questions conceptually for you since you've gone through this exercise on returning of capital. Your 30% to 40% net leverage target, you're going to have confidence in that after you book second quarter backlog assuming it converts, so that assumes always a back half biased to share buybacks? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Ken, just one comment, it's a 30% to 40% gross leverage. It's not net, just FYI. You said net. Richard J. Dugas: And candidly the seasonality within the businesses doesn't impact our leverage ratios much or at all. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And then, when you think about yield, that's yield to your current stock or that's what you value your own company at intrinsically? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: It would be to current value. And we recognize that there's volatility. If we had made this announcement 1.5 week ago, and the price was $17, the yield would have been higher. So again it's -- we're thinking of this through cycle. Obviously, our belief in our forward cash generation will help to drive what we do. And if it turns out that its 1.9% yield or 2.7% yield is less important to us than the consistency and being able to deliver it through cycle. Richard J. Dugas: Yes, and Ken, this is Richard. Just if I could illuminate on that just for a second, the goal here is to signal very clearly and deliberately that we want to be balanced in capital through cycle. And we're making a deliberate statement to suggest that our first priority is in the business, but at high returns. And to the extent that annually we have left over funds, which clearly we think will have a capacity for strong cash flow generation, a combination of dividends and repurchases we think is the best bet for shareholders over the long run. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Right. And I guess if I could ask for your comment just briefly on the news last week with the agencies and the SEC, the rulings about, if qualified residential mortgages, what are the factors that you're going to look at over the next month that you think are most indicative if in fact that's delivering higher demand? Richard J. Dugas: Yes. Well, with regard to what's happening with FHFA right now, Mr. Watt's comments earlier this week certainly leave us encouraged. There's always a path between announcement and implementation, so we have to watch to see what ultimately gets implemented. But we have said for some time that mortgage availability is tight in the industry and we believe any clarity that can be brought with regard to how government loans are going to be treated is important for banks to want to underwrite. And we've heard that again and again from folks at Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and others, so we believe what we've heard is the right step. And I think it's important that the administration has recognized that housing is not as big a driver in the economy as it could be, partly due to credit being a little bit tighter than is necessary. So we're watchful, we're cautious, we're not certainly predicting that anything dramatic changes here, but overtime, if some of these ideas get put into practice, it certainly has the potential to affect activity, particularly for that entry-level category. And I think we've all talked about for a couple of years now that that segment has been underrepresented in the recovery and if it gets going housing could get exciting again. So our view is that it's a positive statement. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : This is Desi filling in for Bob. Just speaking on that topic, maybe a little further along there, do you think the easing of credit standards could be -- maybe what gets us from 1 million starts today to 1.2 million to 1.3 million starts or is it more of smaller incremental upside from where we're at? Richard J. Dugas: That's a really tough question to answer. Candidly, I don't know. I do think it's important to recognize that. A combination of factors will go into this. Number one will be the actual easing of credit to the extent it eases. And number two will be the press that goes around it that suggest to buyers that today could actually get credit that are not applying, to apply. There's certainly some evidence that people think that credit is tighter than it actually is. So a combination of people that are maybe a little bit uneducated with regard to credit today could get in the market along with some actual easing could help us we believe. But in terms of exactly what impact it is in terms of starts are, I don't know how to quantify that at this point. Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : All right. And then on just to give little clarity on the community count absorption pace that you talked about. In the absence of the acquisition of Dominion Homes, would your community kind of have been lowered year-over-year? I'm just trying to square the fact that orders were relatively stable with absorption pace at 5% and community count flat. Richard J. Dugas: Yes, so what happened is we bought it. We have 33 active communities that came online in August and contributed some signup activity. But if you think of retail with same store concept, in our 600 ending communities, are 33 communities from there, so to directly to your question, we would have had 567 communities if we hadn't purchased Dominion. And our pace assumptions, so we've talked about a 5% pace increase. What it does is it takes the 33 out of our ending community count and then takes the signups, excluding the signups from those communities say how did the rest of the business do that was in for the entire quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Ivy Zelman with Zelman Associates. Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC: But the $600 million to $700 million incremental in land and development that you're planning on spending, we got lot of questions about Pulte is chasing land, they're late to the market. They stopped buy -- they didn't buy land when everyone else is buying land and now they're paying at inflated prices and given your disciplines around returns, my first question is really understanding how to comfort investors that you are not going to sacrifice returns by now incrementally buying more land? Richard J. Dugas: Yes, Ivy, this is Richard. First of all, let me just refute directly the fact that we're taking on more risk than we should, as a matter of fact that would be countered to everything that we have said with regard to the last several years about investing in high return communities. We now have this 13-point risk adjusted scale for investment. And frankly, we have stuck to that discipline. We have not chased any land transactions. We do not build in forward price assumptions into our transactions. And in fact, I'm extremely pleased with the quality of the land that we are buying. And frankly, as one of the largest builders in the country, we do have access to land given the size of our checkbook and the land that have been pursuing is of really high-quality across the country. So I completely discount anybody's concern that we are reaching or chasing. And frankly, the rest of our announcement today is indicative of that, as evidence of the fact that we're not going to reach, given the incredibly strong cash flows that we have and frankly are likely to have in the future. We're going to be balanced to ensure in fact that we don't overreach. We've learned the lessons of the past. This company used to be very land heavy. We're not going back there. We want to be very balanced and a combination of prudent, smart, high-returning land, a combination of a growing dividend and maybe stepped up share repurchase activity, I think is evidence of that. Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Very helpful. And then secondly, as we talk about one of the proposals from director Mel Watt was to reintroduce the 97% LTV recognizing that with the loan limits are higher in most of the country relative to FHA, if you could talk about specifically Phoenix and some of the Northern Cal markets where it was more dramatic, whether it be Stockton, Fresno, maybe you're not in those areas as much. But if you could just talk about the potential impact that those markets with the higher loan limit and that 97% LTV could have on your business, is it -- in that -- those markets meaningful? Richard J. Dugas: I guess, great question. It's certainly not insubstantial. A lot of people I think it flew under the radar when the loan limits got dropped. I think people got that really high-cost markets came down from $700 to say $550, but places like Phoenix that or kind of a lot of bread-and-butter housing, a $50,000 or $60,000 drop in loan limits made a big, big difference and took out of swath of the market. So it's again, per someone's earlier question, a little bit hard to quantify exactly what it could mean, but it's clearly a positive. And the only thing we're watchful for is to make sure that it gets implemented responsibly. We've heard the announcements and we're certainly excited about it and through the leading builders of America, our industry has done a good job of advocating for responsible credit and credit that is accessible to all with the right safeguards. And I think we have a good relationship with Mr. Watt and the administration and we're looking forward to seeing what comes of it, but directly to answer your question, it's -- it could be significant. I can't put an exact quantification on it, but it will certainly help housing. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Roxland with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : As Bob mentioned, the commonly managed floor plans increased to about 45% from 39% in 2Q, yet your gross margins still declined sequentially even after testing for 30 bps of accounting adjustments related to Dominion. Can you talk about some of these that weakened mix shift that occurred in the quarter that negatively impacted margins. And I also believe if I recall correctly got in 2Q also had a weaker mix which impacted margins. So I'm just trying to get sense of what actually occurred this quarter and whether you expect this type of trend to persist or reverse going forward? Richard J. Dugas: Yes, Mike, this is Richard. We indicated on the prepared comments, there were 2 factors. One was some unexpected legacy community closeout costs that impacted margins. And second was that mix shift that you mentioned. And frankly, it was less-high margin, Del Webb closings coming through and more lower margin syntax closings coming through. With regard to kind of future trends on mix, it's frankly almost impossible to predict. There is volatility in closing mix and candidly the trade base issues I mention persist in the industry. So overall you can have one particular region versus another closing homes in one quarter. But we continue to be very pleased with our margins. We clearly move from a low-margin company a few years ago to among highest in the space and we like our position overall. Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just as a follow-up, could you -- will it be fair to say that as you sell out of more of the higher-margin Del Webb and continued to see an acceleration in Centex than maybe you'll have this negative mix shift persist on a go forward basis? And then, just as a second question would be with respect to the accounting adjustments, once you get through them, the next 2 or 3 quarters, should we expect to see gross margins rebound to the 23% or 24% you had been achieving? Richard J. Dugas: Yes, Mike, a couple points there. We have said that margins are going to vary quarter-to-quarter and we said that very consistently and I don't see any reason that kind of changed that view. With regard to the second part of your question, we don't have visibility to our margins much beyond the next couple of quarters given sort of our backlog. So frankly, I don't know what's going to happen say as you get into Q2 or Q3 going forward. I will point out that we do have favorable pricing dynamics. We continue to like what we see. We do offsetting that though have higher land cost and some trade pressures coming through. So it's going to be choppy and volatile from here. So it's difficult to give you a guidance number there. Operator : Your next question comes from David Goldberg with UBS. David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I wanted to follow-up Richard on the comments on labor tightness. And I am wondering if you could help us kind of connect that Common Plan Management system, how that's working with the trade, if it's allowing you to attract some of the trade a little bit more favorably because you have more consistent program going through and also if you can with that kind of talk about cycle times and what's happening on homes that are going through this system, what the cycle times would look like versus homes that haven't been -- maybe as valued engineer or as not as efficient right now? Richard J. Dugas: Sure, David, it's Richard. From the labor comments, basically what you're seeing is I think has been well chronicled is, they're just not as many folks available to build the homes that are in production across the country as there were. With regard to Common Plan Management, we are able to attract trades that are more favorably inclined to candidly build for us for 2 reasons. Number one, we're big and we have a large backlog and trades understand that consistency to work is important. And then, our Common Plan Management allows for more ease of production as the trade base particularly on the labor side gets more familiar with the plans. So candidly, I would suggest that even though we're seeing some delays in closing as a result of labor shortages, it's probably less pronounced for us than candidly many folks who are smaller in this space and particularly the real small builders, I think are going through a very volatile time, with regard to overall labor. And we are very optimistic that the Common Plan Management rollout as Bob indicates continues to ramp up, it's a very productive part of our business for many, many reasons. With regard to cycle time, we are focused separately on house turn time and land turn time if you will internally. We have a lot of focus on both those areas. And frankly, we made a lot of progress on our house turns in the last few years, including this year. So how much further can we push it, it's hard to say. Frankly, we're -- inventory turns in total are one of the guiding posts around our focus on return, which has been helpful. So I hope that helps. David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And then just a follow-up on the Common Plan Management system, on customer satisfaction, have you been able to do to gauge, I know it's kind of early in the process still, but in terms of quality of construction, in terms of the fact have you been able to kind of gets engage on overall customer satisfaction and warranty related issues on homes that have gone through this system versus the homes that haven't really even versus the historical where you've been? Richard J. Dugas: David, we certainly have high expectations in that regard. It's probably a little early to look at warranty trends and customer satisfaction trends given the delay between putting these homes in the production closing them and then having people live in them for 1 year or more overall. But clearly everything that we're doing with Common Plan Management we believe has benefits, margin benefits sales space benefits, customer satisfaction benefits. And frankly, to your point, kind of long-term with regard to customer satisfaction and warranty. The features that we're putting in our commonly managed homes, I think a lot of investors appreciate the efficiency gains that we have. We are probably more excited about the actual buyer acceptance of these consumer-driven plans and if you recall the feature CNBC did on us about 1 year ago now, where we're putting homes in productions into prototype and warehouses and getting buyer feedback we're continuing that good work that our marketing and architectural teams are doing. And so we got a lot more of where that comes over time and this whole idea of continuing to refresh our product portfolio while reducing the overall number of floor plans we manage has benefits in all parts of the company. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : First question I had was on the share repurchase and we appreciate obviously the increased focus there. I think it certainly helps the more balanced approach to capital, but when you talk about a gross leverage of 30% to 40%, I guess, right now, you are in the high 20s. And you also mentioned that you'd really be excess cash that you would be deploying after internal investment in dividends. So if I'm reading it right, it doesn't sound like this is going to be a sort of a relatively aggressive bulk purchase at any time more of kind of like the perhaps what you did in this past quarter and maybe a little bit more, but can you kind of give any color on that because certainly again from the gross leverage standpoint, it doesn't seem like you have that much wiggle room although, certainly you have a lot of cash on the balance sheet? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, we do have lot of cash on the balance sheet. We also expect to be generating a lot of cash over the next few years, particularly as we realize the deferred tax asset. But the other thing we've made a point of is we're not stock pickers, so we're not going to be doing an accelerated plan generally. So you can expect us to be buying it sort of dollar cost average through the year, but I think the $750 million speaks to the fact that we're going to be buying more stock. Richard J. Dugas: Yes, and Mike this is Richard. If I could just add having bought back about 4% of our shares with a frankly less-defined program over the past call it 12 to 15 months, we are not talking about insignificant activity, but Bob mentioned on his remarks earlier, we're talking about being routine and systematic and disciplined and balanced, and we see it all as part of a well-orchestrated, well-articulated plan. We think we have articulated our operating philosophy very well for the past several years. We're now trying to articulate our balance sheet and cash philosophy with that same degree of consistency. Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess, secondly, on the absorption pace, I think you mentioned Centex down 8%, Pulte down 4%. And generally people viewing the year ago comp is somewhat easier given the rate driven slowdown from last year. You'd also mentioned that the Common Plan Management does drive some improvement in sales pace. And I'm just trying to get a sense of if you're kind of pleased with the sales pace at current levels, did you think it would have improve off of perhaps an easier 1 year ago comp, and what could be done to perhaps increase that going forward? Richard J. Dugas: So Mike, just a couple of points and Bob can give you the details, but our pace is in Centex and Del Webb were up sharply, especially in Del Webb, so you may have misheard that and we are pleased with our paces. So Bob maybe you can reiterate the numbers. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Yes, so it was up 8%, not down at 8%, Mike. So again, Pulte was up 4%, Centex up 8%, Del Webb up 23%. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Kim with Barclays. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I wanted to sort of follow-up on the land question, the land spend question. You talked about $2.4 billion. We were already modeling it about $1.9 billion. We thought that that was pretty generous. So I was a little surprised, your targeted land spend was about $500 million more than what we're looking for. I was wondering if you could give us some understanding as to the breakout of that spend in terms of new lots versus development of existing lots. And maybe in answering that question if you could let us know whether the 23% of control lots that are finished, how much of those actually are owned versus auctioned? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Yes, so Stephen, we've expressed I'd say over the last 12 months that because we're buying more raw land, our spend during the year has changed. So 2 years ago we were probably we were 2/3 on land and 1/3 on development. It's now probably 50-50. So part of the spend that you're seeing us do next year is to develop the land we've been buying over the last 18 or 24 months. So I think not... Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division : But only half though, but only half, right? Okay. Richard J. Dugas: Yes, it's not an insignificant number though Steve. We're really pleased to with that number. And as we've indicated we have a very clear formula, we get above our cost of capital and we can find high returning assets. We want to grow the business and invest and we spent 2 or 3 years getting our business to that point. We're there now and just to reiterate a comment someone asked earlier, we're definitely not reaching for land. We are being very disciplined and prudent. And frankly, with still a lot of dry powder, we're continuing to return funds to shareholders elsewhere. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Yes, I don't think you got the -- I didn't get the finished number? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Oh sorry, he had asked another one, so say it again Steve please? Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Well, yes, so my question was of the 23% of controlled lots that are finished, I assume the majority of those are owned, but I wanted to check on that. And one other one before I get cut off is that you had talked about in previous quarters perhaps a recovery in the entry-level. I think you'd pointed to some signs in your Centex division. I was curious if you could just quantitatively or qualitatively talk about whether you think that momentum is building, whether it's pulled back, just how you're feeling about the entry-level buyer at this point? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Yes, so Stephen the 80% of those finished lots are owned. Richard J. Dugas: And then Steve, with regard to the entry level we are pleased with what we've seen. The absorption pace is up 8%. It was up -- excuse me, nicely the prior 2 quarters as well. We do think it's building. And as I indicated, while we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, the potential for some of what Mr. Watt outlined to be enacted has the potential to improve it further, we're going to wait and see what happens. But we thought it was a good announcement that they're at least considering it. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Stephen, the one thing that we have seen in terms of the entry-level buyer, they're still buying closer in. We haven't seen them really start to go out to some of the outer markets. We've had a couple meetings here in Atlanta and it's a perfect example. Strong demand in the closer in positions, but if you look at some of the outlining areas where there aren't finished developed lots available, they're still no buying going on out there, so we're pretty comfortable in our ability to respond quickly on this. But right now again, the demand is closer in and not further out. Operator : Your next question comes from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : First, I wanted to follow-up on the conversation Desi and Bob are having earlier. If you take out the 30-odd communities from Dominion at the end of 3Q, it implies a pretty steep drop in the number of communities. I think you mentioned some of the factors. Obviously, there was the close out of the legacies, which impacted your gross margins as well. You also mentioned that delays in opening new communities. So the drop that we saw here, the significant drop is that just -- how should we think about that? Is that just a temporary mismatch and that the trend that established -- has been established in last few quarters of increasing community count should continue or is there something more than that? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy: We have guided between 560 and 580 throughout 2014. So X Dominion, we were right within the guidelines that we have provided. Richard J. Dugas: And Nishu a little more color on that. Things are taking longer to open. There's no question about that overall. And as Bob indicated in his prepared remarks that persists. So we're trying to be balanced and not get communities open before they're ready and before we're ready to present a good sales image overall. But I don't think that implies anything one way or another kind of going forward. And as we indicated earlier, we will be giving guidance for 2015s community count on our Q4 call. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Dahl with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I wanted to go back Richard to your comments on the entry-level buyer a minute ago. And I was curious because you still said that I think in earlier remarks, land deals are best for so that move up and active adult. So in your budgeting for next year, is that contemplating more of a shift towards more of the Centex type communities? Richard J. Dugas: Mike, it's a good question. And the way we do that is when we allocate capital to the operations, we are agnostic as to where they spend it. We want it to go to the highest returning opportunities that they find, and they clearly have a targeted plan. But we don't push it towards say Pulte or Centex or Del Webb, any of the brands. So the answer is I don't know how exactly that's going to play out. Overall it depends on what we see in the market when folks are requiring property. What I will say is the same factors that go into the underwriting are the same ones. So what we said consistently is that up to now, while margins have been very acceptable in that category paces have not recovered yet to where we believe they are needed to underwrite a lot of Centex communities because given the limited pricing power that we have on the buyer income side with regard to Centex, we need more pace to support good returns. As the market recovers and particularly if the entry-level begins to see a little bit more credit availability, the potential does exist for that category to come back and therefore, for us to start seeing more land deals there. But it will be dependent on whether the pace comes back to a point at which that becomes a bigger factor. So I don't know exactly how that's going to play out. I think it's clear based on what we have purchased the last year or 2 that for the foreseeable year to 18 months most of our openings are going to be on the Pulte or Del Webb side, but we're hopeful that could change with a little better availability in the future for credit. Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : That's helpful. And I guess as a follow-up at a high-level you also made comments that you want to be careful to avoid getting into stretching for growth rates that are going to put real strain on the organization and clearly you've had some runoff of legacy land, but this will be the second year looking out to 2015 that you're looking for 40% growth on the spend side and so a lot more of that coming. On development, that does support quite a bit of growth. So how do you reconcile that like how close are you to a level where you're less comfortable pushing for growth aggressively? Richard J. Dugas: Yes, Mike, again, we're not giving kind of community count guidance, but land investment dollars don't necessarily translate into volume or community count directly. It totally depends on what you're buying, what markets you're buying it in, how expensive the land was where you are. So I am not concerned about us approaching the level of which we get concerned about growth. We are nowhere near candidly the growth rates of what we use to be in the past through the boom times. And as I started out the prepared remarks and my first question out of box today, we are not going back there. We're going to be very balanced with our view. We're going to be balanced with our capital allocation and mindful of what can happen when we get overly aggressive. So we're not close to that edge at all and frankly not concerned about it, but we're very mindful of it and are going to be cautious. Operator : Your next question comes from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just a follow up I wanted to ask was Richard about the Investor Day. It's been quite some time since you had an Investor Day. And that certainly not from a lack of exciting things happening at Pulte. Value Creation strategy being conceived and executed well in the past couple of years, so I wanted to get your thoughts on what prompted the decision to kind of create an special outreach event for investors? And maybe if you could just some preview on what you will be covering, because clearly it has created some excitement around the event. Richard J. Dugas: Yes, I appreciate that. First of all, this is not something that we intend to do every year. And it's been many years as you've indicated. We think we have a great story to tell. And while we have gotten pieces of the message out over the last several years, we don't feel like we have had a forum to really tell the entire story. So what you can expect is a little bit of a view onto what the details were and how we got to the philosophy that we are today. We're certainly going to expose you to some of the possibilities for the future with regard to what Common Plan Management can do for us, what our pricing philosophies can do and demonstrate for investors that there's more energy around some of the things that we have been working on than have yet kind of come to the market. And then we're going to get a little more detailed on this capital allocation strategy. How we got to it, what the parameters are and basically walk into a little more detail than we're able to do on an earnings call like today. So we think it's a very robust lineup. We look forward to seeing as many investors there as possible and it should be a good day for us. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session for today's conference. I will now turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer. James P. Zeumer: Great. Thanks everybody for your time this morning. We've gone through our allocated time for today's call. We're certainly available for the remainder of the day if anybody has got any follow-up questions. We will look forward to seeing you on December 9 here in Atlanta, Georgia. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Shawn; I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2014 PulteGroup Inc Fourth Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference. Jim Zeumer : Thank you, operator, and good morning. This is Jim Zeumer, Head of Investor Relations for PulteGroup. I want to welcome you to our conference call to discuss the company's fourth quarter financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2014. Participating in today's call to discuss our results are Richard Dugas, Chairman and President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Vice President and Financing Controller. Let me remind everyone that copies of this morning's earnings release along with presentation slide that accompanies today's call are posted to our corporate website at www.pultegroupinc.com. We'll also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all the participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. This risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.  That's it. Now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard? Richard Dugas : Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Early in December, we hosted our first Analysts and Investor Day in almost a decade. Our goal in hosting the meeting was to provide a comprehensive review of our value creation strategy and the underlying initiatives which have driven its success over the past four years. The topics of our Investor Day included a review of the significant operating and financial gains we've realized as we work to deliver higher returns on invested capital. And assessment of the opportunities that remain to realize additional gains in revenues, gross margin, overhead leverage and overall construction and asset efficiency. And finally a comprehensive analysis of our focus on capital efficiency and our related approach to capital allocation. For those of who you are unable to attend, I'd certainly encourage to review the presentation which is posted on our website.  I am extremely pleased to say that the strong financial performance we delivered in the fourth quarter and the full year demonstrates the ongoing success of our efforts. In a couple of minutes Bob will provide a detailed analysis of our fourth quarter results and gains we've realized. So let me spend my time looking at our full year 2014 progress against our value creation strategy. On slightly lower unit volumes we generated a 4% increase in home sale revenues to $5.7 billion. The much more telling number however is our ability to leverage the 4% revenue growth into a 33% increase in reported pretax income of $635 million for homebuilding operations. Inclusive of our financial services operation, we realized pretax income growth of 31% to $690 million. The significant increase we generated in 2014 pretax income was supported by our strategic pricing and common plan initiatives along with interest savings from our dramatic debt reductions over the past few years. In combination, these factors help to expand our reported 2014 gross margin by 280 basis points to 23.3% and pretax margin by 250 basis points to 11.8%. As we've done over the past several years, we capitalized on our strong operating performance and associated cash flows by implementing a disciplined allocation of capital, which included investing $1.8 billion into our business in 2014, an increase of roughly 40% over 2013. We are also in position to comfortably expand our plan 2015 investment by another 30% to $2.4 billion, but only if we can identify high returning projects.  We retired $246 million of debt in 2014, helping to reduce our yearend debt to capital to 27% among the lowest in the industry. We returned $321 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and after all these we still ended the year with $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet which is available for planned investments and to fund dividends in any future share repurchases.  We are extremely pleased with these results and I am personally very proud of the entire organization for all the hard work they have invested to make them happen. Given the significant gains we've realized over the past several years since launching our value creation strategy in 2011, we remain committed to this program and the ongoing benefits we believe we can deliver. As such we will continue to focus on margins, overhead leverage, inventory returns, return on invested capital and disciplined capital allocation. Back in 2010, we analyzed 20 years of financial and operating data on our company and our peers. The findings clearly show that company is generating the highest return on invested capital drove the greatest total shareholder returns over the housing cycle. An ROIC focus should have value in all market conditions, but we believe it can be particularly effective during the sustained but historically slower paced housing recovery, we expect will continue for the next few years. By focusing on returns, we've controlled our investment and land assets and lowered our house inventory by reducing specs and accelerating cycle time. Having raised our return on invested capital above our cost of capital, our land investment spends is moving beyond maintenance, and is now supporting future growth. Consistent with our operating strategy this would be higher return growth not just investing to churn out higher unit volumes. And as we demonstrated in 2013 and 2014, if the appropriate land transactions are not available, we won't force investments into the system but we'll continue to use our capital to fund ongoing dividend payments and repurchase shares. At the same time, we continue to advance our common plan management work and related initiatives to squeeze additional efficiencies out of our construction operations. Many of you got to hear from Ryan Marshall, Harmon Smith and Mike Wyatt at the Investor Day. So you can better appreciate how much we've accomplished and yet how much opportunity remains to be realized.  Overall, I view 2014 as another year of great progress relative to our value creation work. Equally important I think we enter 2015 in a strong overall position with opportunities to drive additional operating and financial gains.  Now I'd like to turn over the call to Bob for discussion of our fourth quarter results. Bob? Bob O'Shaughnessy : Thanks, Richard. And good morning. I'd like to echo Richard's comments for 2014 marked another significant step in our progress and highlight that the fourth quarter represented strong finish to the year. Beginning with the review of our income statements, home sales revenues in the fourth quarter increased 10% over the prior year at $1.8 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 7% increase in closing volumes to 5,316 combined with the 3% or $9,000 increase in our average selling price to $334,000. The increase in our average selling price reflects higher sales prices at all three of our brands. In the fourth quarter Centex is up 1% to $212,000, Pulte was up 5% to $406,000 and Del Webb was up 4% to $327,000. The mix of closings by brand changed only slightly from last year's fourth quarter with 45% of closings coming from Pulte communities, 30% from Del Webb and 25% from Centex.  Our fourth quarter gross margin was 23.1% which is down 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year, but up 20 basis points on a sequential basis. Our stable Q4 margins reflect a number of factors including the company's efficiency and pricing initiatives, interest savings from our significant debt pay down, the mix home closed as well as change in labor material and land prices. In addition, although the land market is competitive, we believe our focus over the last few years of investing in well positioned, higher returning land assets has helped support our margins. Fourth quarter option revenue per closing increased 11% or $4,800 over the prior year while lot premiums in the period decreased 5% or $680. Sales discount for the quarter remain below at just over $7,000 or 2.1% for home compared with approximately $5,500 or 1.7% for home last year. We've said for a number of quarters that discounts are likely approaching their lower limit so the Q4 change should be viewed as typical and quarterly variant and not a shift in our pricing strategy. As we've said the company's future margin performance, there is clearly a number of macro and local market forces at work. In this volatile operating environment, we continue to focus on our value creation strategy and we'll respond to local market challenges on a community by community basis. Based on our view of the market and considering the company's specific opportunities we see in strategic pricing and construction efficiency initiative, weighed against the challenging competitive dynamics in the market, we are targeting full year gross margins in 2015 to be consistent with our current level of 23% with the proviso that we expect they will be moving up or down as we move from quarter-to-quarter including previously discussed Q1 headwinds from acquisition accounting adjustments associated with our Dominion transaction. SG&A costs for the fourth quarter totaled $146 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues compared with a $150 million or 9.3% last year. Our SG&A expenses for the period was benefited by approximately $15 million or $0.03 per share from reversals of construction related insurance reserve. The reduction to our insurance reserves is not directly tied to the insurance charge we took in the second quarter of this year reflect typical adjustments based on actuarial assessments of our construction related exposures which trended modestly better than projected in the second half of the year.  Looking at our projected overhead spend in 2015, we expect our SG&A will be in the range of $160 million to $165 million per quarter, which is consistent with our underlying spend in Q4 of this year. The increase over 2014 relates primarily to investments we are making in support of our value creation initiatives and in connection with the increased number of community tool we will be opening and operating this year.  As noted in our press release this morning, we recorded a charge of $8.7 million, or $0.01 per share for lease exit cost in connection with the relocation of our corporate offices to Atlanta. The charges recorded another expense net and were anticipated in the original cost estimate we provided when our relocation was announced. Our financial services operations reported pretax income of $13 million in the fourth quarter, which is up from $7 million last year. In the quarter, financial services benefited from higher volumes and decreasing interest rate which drove higher gains on mortgage sales. Capture rate for the period improved to 81% from 79% last year. In aggregate, our pretax income for the fourth quarter was $267 million, which is up $35 million or 15% over the prior year.  Closing out our review of the income statement, we reported $50 million of income tax expense which represented effective tax rate of 19%. It should be noted that our fourth quarter tax is reflect benefit of approximately $50 million, or $0.13 per share associated with the regulation of a certain federal and state tax matters as well as adjustments to our state deferred tax asset valuation allowance.  The company's normalized effective tax rate in the quarter was 38%, which is lower than our original guidance of 39% for the full year. At this time, we expect our 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 38%. On the bottom line, reported net income for the fourth quarter of $217 million, or $0.58 per share. Included in this result for the tax and insurance benefits of $0.16 per share partially offset by the lease exit charge of $0.01 per share.  Moving out to homebuilding operations. At the end of the quarter we had a total of 5,059 homes under construction of which 26% were spec. As a percentage of construction activity, this is comparable with the prior year. At year end, our finished back inventory amounted to only 483 homes, keeping us below an average of one per community. In the fourth quarter, we approved approximately 8,800 lots for purchase which brings our total for the year just over 22,000 lots. One interesting note about our Q4 land transactions almost 60% of the lots were for Del Webb communities including four new positions and an extension of our highly successful Georgetown community outside Boston, Texas. Given the timeline for developing these positions, we expect these projects will impact our operations in 2016 and beyond. We spent $539 million on land acquisitions and development in the quarter, bringing our total land spent for 2014 to approximately $1.8 billion. Consistent with recent quarters, our spent was split equally between development and acquisition. As we noted at our Investor Day, our spent this year was less than our authorization of $2 billion. As a result, the authorization of $2.4 billion for 2015 includes the $200 million remaining authorization from 2014 as we seek to allow our local homebuilding teams to manage their capital investment programs over time with any eye towards driving investment in high quality high returning transactions. We finished the year with 131,000 lots under control of which of 35,000 or 26% were controlled via option. Of our controlled lot approximately 25% are finished with another 18% currently under development. Looking at our 96,000 owned lots as measured against our 2014 deliveries of 17,196 homes, our own lots supply is approximately 5.6 years which is two years lower than we maintained in 2011. We are pleased with our progress on this metric given its significance to our overall return on invested capital.  As we have demonstrated throughout the year, we are actively allocating capital beyond our land investment activities. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of our stock for $98 million, or $18.87 per share. This level of activity is roughly twice the level we executed during each of the first three quarters of 2014, and is consistent with our announcement at last quarter that we had increased our repurchase authorization by $750 million. We put the extended authorization in place with the intension of using it and clearly we are.  Based on our strong operating performance, we ended the year with $1.3 billion of cash despite the significant investments we made during the year in land and our return to shareholders of $321 million in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We expect to use this capital over time in the fashion we laid out at our Investor Day. Our debt to capital at the end of the quarter was 27% which is down from 31% last year. Few final data points. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 sign ups to increase 1% to 3,232 homes which on a dollar basis increased 2% to $1.1 billion. Unit signs up increased 4% at Pulte while slipping 3% at both Centex and Del Webb. Fourth quarter absorption paces were down 5% at Centex and 7% at Pulte while Del Webb closed out a very strong year as absorption paces gain 10% in the quarter. The lower absorption paces for Centex and Pulte were impacted in part by a decision to slowdown and in some cases stop sales at several Columbus and Louisville communities as backlog levels have gone too far extended. Excluding the impact of the Columbus and Louisville operations, our absorptions paces were essentially flat versus the prior year.  We finished the year with 598 communities which are up 4% from the end of 2013. Looking ahead to 2015, we expect to operate out of approximately 600 to 620 communities in each quarter of the year, up from the 560 to 580 range for 2014. Plans calls for opening over 200 new communities in 2015, so it will be another busy year for our operations.  Finally, we ended 2014 with a unit backlog of 5,850 homes valued at $1.9 billion compared with 5,772 homes valued at $1.9 billion last year. Now let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments. Richard Dugas : Thanks Bob. As we typically do, let me provide a few comments on the market conditions we experienced in the quarter. At a regional level, on the East Coast, we continue to see the same general pattern that existed throughout the year with demand getting stronger as you move from the North East down to the South East and into Florida. The Carolina, Georgia and Florida in particular were among our strongest markets. Demand in the middle third of the country experienced the similar pattern with conditions improving as you move from North to South. We have purposefully slowed sales in the roughly 30 communities we acquired from Dominion in Columbus and Louisville as delivery dates on the acquired backlog and new signs up were out too far. We are working hard as we speak to get builds cost down and strategic pricing tools established in both of these markets.  As was the case throughout the first nine months of 2014, Texas was strong in the fourth quarter with demand improving as we move through the period. We are certainly monitoring conditions to see what impact lower oil prices ultimately have on housing demand but thus far in January demand in Texas continue to be strong. We have read the articles on Texas' economy being more diversified than in the past and how the benefits of lower gas prices nation wide provides a big tailwind for the overall economy. We appreciate the potential for lower oil prices to impact the Texas' economy. Like everyone else we have to see how this plays out in 2015. We are fortunate in that our investments are diversified by brand in each market and geographically diversified across the markets of Texas and across the country. Fourth quarter results were generally stable out west although conditions were volatile over the period. California principally the coastal and bay areas, Arizona and New Mexico held up well during the quarter. Our newest Del Webb community called Mirehaven is just opening for sales in Albuquerque, so we are looking forward to seeing how these performed in the year. Relative to our expectations, we are pleased with the fourth quarter demand trends which suggested positive momentum was building as we move through the period. On a year-over-year basis, we generally experienced higher traffic levels and signs up volumes and held up except for our actions to slow pace in Columbus and Louisville as we move through the period. We've seen a continuation of these positive traffic and sign up trends in the first few weeks of January which we consider a good sign heading into the important spring selling season. These recent demand trends are consistent with our optimistic view as we head into 2015 with expectations that housing demand continues on a slow and steady recovery path that we have been discussing for the past several years. We are mindful however that there are lots of cross currents which will impact individual markets differently and make demand challenging to predict. Overall, we believe that the positives and the improving economy with declining energy cost, rising employment, lower mortgage rates and related fees beneficial long-term demographic trends in a generally healthy supply of inventory should be able to offset any headwinds the industry may face.  The reality is that we can't control the U.S. economy or the housing markets. What we can do is concentrate on running the best business we can. For us, this means continuing to improve the returns on invested capital we generate over time by capturing efficiencies in our operations. It also means implementing a supportive capital allocation program that in this order seeks to first invest in projects to maintain or grow relative market share while achieving required return thresholds. Second, fund an increasing dividend. Third, selectively engage in return accretive M&A and fourth, distribute any residual capital through systematic share repurchases. Let me close by thanking the employees PulteGroup for their hard work to successfully implement our strategies and for delivering the tremendous gains we realized in 2014. I believe you are the best team in the industry. Also, I want to thank you and our suppliers and trade partners for your enthusiastic support of PulteGroup's built on a program. I am proud and humbled by your efforts. Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? Jim Zeumer : Thank you, Richard. We will now open the call for questions. So that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Shawn, if you explain the process, we will get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ivy Lynne Zelman. Your line is open. Ivy Lynne Zelman : Good morning. Great job on the presentation guys and solid quarter. Richard, can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the mortgage environment given some of these policies changes as well as maybe challenges on why people can't get approved, what the main reason, please? Richard Dugas : Sure. Ivy, good morning. From the mortgage environment the changes that the President announced few weeks ago, I honestly think it is too early to see how they play out. Having said that, I am very optimistic and certainly I think my peers are optimistic that they are meaningful changes. As you know, the mortgage environment has been tight overall and the FHA fee change announcement allows several hundred thousand new potential buyers to qualify for FHA mortgages. So we are optimistic and as we noted in our commentary we believe that there was a demand shift that began sometime around Thanksgiving that began playing out in December. And we certainly saw positive trends through the first weeks of January. Ivy Lynne Zelman : And can you comment on why people do get denied when applying for mortgages maybe as Centex operations and some of the impairment that you guys see that are lingering or challenging? Because it seems this FHA have pretty lean underwritings to get those people with credit scores low and low down payment. So what are the reasons when people can't get approved? Richard Dugas : Yes, Ivy, I think it is couple of things. I guess primarily down payment difficulty. I think underwriting standards with regard to FICO scores and debt to income ratios and things like that have been stringent for some time. And I think the big impairment is down payment scores and then of course lenders wanting to lend in this environment so that the changes in FHA I believe are significant. That 3.5% down payment threshold with proper supportive appropriate underwriting guideline is a very effective program. I think the folks at FHA would tell you that the quality of the book that they have been writing last several years is outstanding. So I think down payments are an issue overall. And that to me is one of the big impairments, one of the reasons why FHA is so important. So we are very optimistic that the changes that we've seen with these recent announcements will have an effect. I think it is little too early for us to say whether that's driving the improved activities we are seeing yet or just people being more optimistic in general about housing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko. Your line is open. Jack Micenko : Hi, good morning. Richard in Analyst Day you talked about a net debt cap number 30% to 40% longer-term target. Obviously you are below that now, with the pull back in the long end of the curve just thinking about where your head is at around maybe layering a little more balance sheet leverage and how we can think about that line going forward? Bob O'Shaughnessy : Yes, Jack, it is Bob. I think the answer to that is it will depend on our investment levels, it will depend on our capital outlets for other things, and share repurchases being the driver that largely-- certainly as we look at our leverage we've got maturities in fiscal 2015 that are relatively modest. Then we've got bigger maturity in fiscal 2016. And so as we think about we will look at the long end of the curve, we'll also think about we've got -- we've already got paper out there. It might make more sense to start building the latter in the sort of 5 to 10 years window. And I think it's really going to just depend on what the capital market is like when we actually are in a position where we need to issue some debt. Jack Micenko : Okay, great. Let's just say 2015 is maybe the year of return of the first time buyer, how quickly can you ramp Centex? I mean we always think about third, a third in your business mix and the other two have been fairly successful where demands has been at, but can that number rise above 30%, can you pivot fairly quick to meet that demand? Richard Dugas : Jack, this is Richard. I guess first and foremost I remind everyone we still have a big Centex position and just like we've seen with other segments the first place you will see in same store sales growth. So I am very confident that we can capture our fair share of that activity. In terms of new investment, it is likely an 18 to 24 months cycle so we could put dollars to work now if we saw that activity improving, that could benefit say the end of 2016. It is not an immediate turnaround. In some cases it can be quicker than that. As an example in Texas, the market is little bit easier to access land and you might -- it might have a little bigger impact for 2016. I think it is fair to say that 2015 is baked, but I remind everyone that the first place improved demand shows up is in same store sales growth and as we commented on Del Webb and Pulte before, it is quite a bit of leverage we can get from relatively deep land position we have there as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East. Your line is open. Stephen East : Thank you. Just talking little bit more about the capital allocation et cetera and maybe Bob this first question is for you. If you look at it $2.4 billion in land spend, you spent about $300 million for next year and you spent about $300 million in dividends and repurchase, ignoring any type of M&A, are you comfortable with that number being -- those combined being around $3 billion or so and with that where would you like -- where would you feel comfortable with your cash balance dropping down to? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes we certainly look at liquidity and it's not just cash, its availability under our revolver and it can be substantially below where it is here. I don't want to say $250 million or $500 million because it is really going to depend on the timing of cash flows and obviously the way the business works, a lot of our closing volumes in the back half of the year. And so if we spent a lot of money early in the year on land and development, we might go a little bit lower on cash and then expect to recoup which is closing to the back half of the year. So it is not a hard and fast rule but certainly we could live comfortably between $250 million and $500 million and actual cash Stephen East : Okay. So having a $3 billion type number out there is not a big stretch and I guess when you look at it? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes. I don' want to -- I don't want to say what we are going to spend on share repurchases because that will happen over time, but I think order of magnitude, you are absolutely right. Stephen East : Okay, fair enough. And then if you look at -- Richard, that was helpful on Centex, how long it would take to ramp up, if you just look at your land spend in 2014 and then perspectively in 2015, could you talk about where you put money regionally? Where you are going in 2015 and is there any switch among the other buckets other than Centex? Richard Dugas : Yes. Stephen from a geographic standpoint given the stringent standards we have, it is fair to say we allocated an appropriate amount of money across the country. I don't think there is any one geography that stood out. We are certainly being cautious in some of the places that we have a long land balance as we work hard improve returns. And as an example we have a very large land balance in the DC area, we have a large land balance in Phoenix. So we would want to be appropriately focused and not get too far ahead there and continue to drive our turns. As relates to segment, we have in 2014 continued to put most of our money in Pulte, Bob indicated though we did see a ramp up in Del Webb's spend in the fourth quarter in terms of approved transactions. That's going to ebb in flow up and down, those don't come in evenly. So I'd expect in 2015, we are going to get predominantly Pulte branded approvals with some Del Webb and Centex I think is a TBD. We didn't do a whole lot of it last year. We got to see that activity continue to ramp up before we really push the accelerator there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg. David Goldberg : Thanks, good morning, everybody. I was -- last quarter I was wonder if you could talk a little about competitive environment at Webb. And now you kind of mention for the business for homebuilding generally certainly competitive and some of the competition maybe doing a little more incentive and discount little bit more. So could talk about the Webb business? I know prices up 4% this quarter you mentioned but what's the environment, how is traffic been and are you finding that buyers are looking for more incentives or more discount as they come in the door? Richard Dugas : David the Webb environment is probably the least competitive of all the segments that we deal in because the uniqueness of the offering that we have. We certainly have good competitors there. Shea Homes is a very good competitor obviously some of our larger peers like Lennar Hovnanian others have competitive offerings. But Webb is we believe unique. What we find there and this is consistent with what we've seen two past cycles, those buyers not nearly as price sensitive as some of the other categories. What they want is confidence in the economy and confidence in their ability to sell their existing home which is clearly improved through 2014 versus what it was say in 2012 and 2013 which is why we've seen absorption paces lead in Q4 there. And I'd expect good things out of Webb this year. We typically see them being a latter cycle play in housing market and that continues to play out, so I don't want to give anyone the impression there is no competition there but it is certainly an area that we have the ability to push margin and price more than some of the other areas because of the lack competitors but also frankly because that buyer category is less price sensitive in general. David Goldberg : That's fantastic. And then Richard I want to ask a bit of a follow- up question. You mentioned in your comments about kind of maintaining market share or growing market share as you look forward and you look at the growth in within your closing and kind of flattish year-over-year up a little bit year-over-year from where we are now, what I am trying to get an idea is with community count that you have big then and the guidance you gave, do you think that would position or you would kind of maintain market share versus the overall market, do you think you grow faster than the market or do you think it is too hard to determine I mean like that just based on the community count growth. Richard Dugas : Yes. David it is tough to know what exactly our competitors are going to do but I'll just remind everyone a couple of things. We were much disciplined about not pushing investments until we got above our cost to capital. That happen for us sometime in 2013 and that's when you begin to see us accelerating our investment to more than I think it has script indicated maintenance mode and more in a growth mode. How that relates to our ability to take shares is going to be really depended obviously on what happens to the market and what our competitors spend. I'd expect that over a period of time not necessarily today or tomorrow but over a period of time that we are going to be able to grow our share but one of the factors that we are focused on internally is the concept of relative market share and meaning our size in the market vis-\u00e0-vis our peers. And we believe that if we can have relative market share somewhere around 0.5 or greater that captures the majority of the efficiencies that we can get in a market. So our goal has been to push our relative market share to at least that level in every market and in many were much greater than that. And for those markets where we have not been able to achieve that either figure out a way to get there or get out of the market. And we've been much disciplined with that. So how does that relate to overall market share growth, it is really hard to say? Clearly, we are focused on generating high returns and as you can see with our community count guidance, growing our business in general but I wish I could give you a more definitive answer on market share but it is a little too complicated to answer that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless. Your line is open. Jay McCanless : Good morning, everyone. First question I had was going back to Centex. Do you see the opportunity either through acquisition or through loosening of the mortgage standards to maybe increase that neighborhood counts. I know you've all been asked to this a couple of different ways but just after the commentary we heard on the third-quarter call I was surprised not to hear more about Centex and where you're going with that. Richard Dugas : Well, Jay, I'll remind everyone that part of what we acquired with Dominion was Centex. I don't remember the exact percentage but the sizable piece of that business was that first time category. So there is a good example of our desire to get into that space where we feel like the terms and price points and financial transactions matter. So we are paying attention to this category but we said consistently before we need pace to continue to come back to ensure that returns get there. Now again I'll just remind everyone that we like overseeing these last few weeks and couple of months with the market. So that could be the beginning of an opportunity for us to begin and invest more in Centex. So we are going to not force investment in the segments that don't generate the highest returns for us and we are certainly hopeful that Centex becomes a bigger part of that equation. But we are going to watch the market to make sure. Jay McCanless : Okay. And then just a follow-up question I had is on a Del Webb. Are you seeing an increasing amount of cash wires there? Are you seeing people come with more --either of higher down payments et cetera? Just wondering if you are seeing more well-heeled buyers starting to get into that market and helping to accelerate the sales pace there? Richard Dugas : Yes. It has been fairly consistent, Jay. We've been sort of in the 40% to 45% range for cash buyers, cash as a percentage of the total Del Webb category overall. Not a big change in the financial profile. Again this buyer category is quite different from either Centex or Pulte, in that they have a large asset base built up; they are less concerned about income. It is more about cash flow and their overall position. Their financial position and what we tend to see with this category is that if they feel good about the economy and their own financial position, they tend to increasingly want to buy. For the Del Webb buyers, it is really not a question of whether they want a new lifestyle, they clearly do, it is a question when they are comfortable pulling the trigger. And as we've seen slow and steady improvement in that category which should continued to bear out in Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Zener. Your line is open. Ken Zener : Good morning, gentlemen. I appreciate your gross margin outlook. Given that it's fairly steady, could you comment on what gives you the confidence in giving that guidance given the overall pressure we're seeing from gross margins from some of the larger builders. Some are highlighting lower margins to go after high returns. Others are just saying we're at a high-level, let's smell the coffee. Can you express where your confidence comes from? Is it that your common plans are giving you that lift or is it that because you didn't buy high-priced land that would be helpful. Thank you so much. Richard Dugas : Sure, Ken. This is Richard. A number of things, we highlighted few of these things in our script but number one common plan management and efficiency of production, we believe continues to make a difference for us. So that's part of it. Ken Zener : Would you quantify that? Or you just ranking them? Richard Dugas : It is very hard -- no, I am not ranking them but you asked about the different factors. So let me just kind of give you them. Number one is the common plan management and that's clearly important to us. Two would be our strategic pricing focus. We do have a very disciplined focus on lot premiums, option pricing, ensuring that we have a systematic base price increases when we can. So we are being disciplined there. We also are very proud of land that we have been buying. We believe that our focus on land has been very disciplined and focused on high return, that's all. I'll also point that our limited spec inventories helping us. We are not discounting a bunch of finished bag and frankly that continues to weigh on our margins very positively. We've also got lower interest costs that are coming through as a result of all the debt we pay down and we are very proud of that. So when you add this all up it equals what we call value creation. It is a road to higher returns over time to generate the best possible total shareholder return and we believe we are on that road and well on that road. We are doing well with it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dahl. Your line is open. Michael Dahl : Hello, thanks for taking my question. Richard, I guess the follow on Ken's question on or to a certain extent of the margin side. It seems like strategic pricing still obviously a focus. You've got backlog that looks kind of flattish. Pricings flattened out. Community count growth is going to improve a little. It seems like the way your setting up for the business is for a fairly low revenue growth at least for this year, for maybe some investments kick in. Is that fair? Richard Dugas : Mike, we are not commenting on our revenue targets or unit targets overall. I would just remind everyone that we are executing our playbook. We increased investment into the business starting 2013, we clearly ramped up in 2014, we are guiding to our more investment in 2015. It does take time for that investment to flow through. We are staying disciplined on it overall. So we are very happy with our overall trajectory and sometimes we wish we could push a button and community would pop open. We are facing entitlement delays and development delays just like other people are. But in the scheme of it we like to slow and steady progress that we are on. We feel like that benefits investors. We are really being smart about the land that we buy not getting out ahead of ourselves. And if you were to walk around our communities and talked to our leaders around the company, they would tell you they are focused on returns. And a portion of that is of course pretax income growth. But a portion of it is also inventory returns and SG&A leverage and all the other pieces. So I am just trying to run balance business, Mike. Michael Dahl : Got it. And, I guess, as a follow-up, and Bob I think you've commented that you expect SG&A to be in a dollar range of $160 million to $165 million per quarter. So I guess did I hear that correctly? And, if so, that seems to imply that you potentially de-lever by maybe 100 basis points or so. So just how to think about that and what the opportunity or timeframe of re-levering the SG&A would be? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, obviously, you are right. We are projecting an increase in our spend and it is for all the things that we are working though. And sometimes you have to spend in advance obviously we are opening a lot of communities. This year opened a lot of communities last year, so there are costs associated with that. I think if you take a step back what we are proud of is -- you look at our operating margin for 2014 and it is -- excluding the construction defect accounting in the second quarter 13%. So we are paying attention to our spend and choosing where to invest. So I think we are delivering on the bottom line and trying to be disciplined about that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim. Your line open. Stephen Kim : Can you guys hear me? Okay, sorry about that. Yes, very interesting call and obviously good result. I guess a couple of questions related to your guidance on margins. You just has put a lot of emphasis on return on invested capital. But not -- but than giving guidance on the gross margin but not really giving guidance on the revenues, what strikes me about that, that's interesting is that most of the others builders that are talking about somewhat lower gross margin with a little bit more volume are also talking about return on capital and talking about the fact that they are able to sort of tolerate a somewhat lower gross margin because of the fact that they are just simply focusing on return on capital and now sometimes require more volume, expense to margins and that's okay. I think counter return on capital guidance figure from you and I was curious if you could give one because just giving a gross margin kind of guidance number without a revenue number doesn't really seemed to be consistent with the focus on return on capital. So I was wondering if you can give some more guidance on the return on capital. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Steve, this is Bob. We have not historically nor did we today give guidance on what our goals are. What we've said consistently over time is that we seek to improve it. You heard Richard say we got our cost to capital, our returns exceeds our weighted average cost to capital sometime in 2013. We are moving that forward. We've got a lot of cash. We wanted to manage through that. We have large deferred tax asset. So our investment profile, our invested capital profile is a little bit different than we might like. So rather than set a target that gets measured against your goal is improvement. And we think we've been doing that and expect to continue to do that. Richard Dugas : And Steve, this is Richard. I'll just add a little bit of color, to add emphasis to what Bob said. We want to improve returns over time. The way capital flows into this business is lumpy at times quarter-to-quarter. There can be volatility but clearly over time we want to improve returns. We've got one builder in this space that has outstanding returns. And we are in second place the way we measure it. And we want to close that gap over a period of time. So just because we didn't give an ROIC target for a lot of reasons, don't think for a minute we are not focused on improving it. Stephen Kim : No. That comes through loud and clear. Great, thanks very much for that. So with this focus on returning I want to then shift a little bit to the gross margin because what's interesting is that you're talking the flat gross margin outlook for 2015, but you have three sort of distinct businesses, you have the Centex, Del Webb, Pulte, and I was curious if we should be thinking that in general your gross margins will be flat next year in each of those three sub-categories or if you are envisioning that one may start to drive negative year-over-year margins, but that others would be up and so the aggregate would be flat. If you could just help me understand how widespread is going to be? Richard Dugas : Yes, Steve, we're not breaking it down in that much detail. What I can tell you is that Webb continues to and Pulte continues to deliver higher margins than Centex does. Again our operators are incented. Their pay systems, our pay systems for the senior leadership team are all focused around return. We continue to focus a lot on margins though because we believe it's a big driver of return and we've seen what has done for us. I'll just point everyone to the comment Bob made around operating margins. When we got operating margins excluding the charge we had to take in Q2 last year around 30%, we're pretty proud of that. So we're continuing to focus on that. So I would just leave you that Webb and Pulte higher than Centex overall in margins, but the volatility within each of the guidance within each we are not providing that level of detail. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland Mike Roxland : Thanks very much. And congratulation on a good quarter and a good year. Now there a bit lot of questions on Centex on this call thus far so really I don't want to be dead horse here, but just one quick follow up. Obviously you've seen some of your competitors begin to focus more on the first time buyer; you yourself have seen some improvement in Centex, ignoring what some of weakness in 4Q. At what point do you start to become more constructive on that cohort and begin investing in it, and is there any particular metric that you look at that we get you over the hurdle. And if let's say if that metric is return their type of return hold that must be clear before you start actively investing. Can you just help us frame how you would get comfortable putting deploy more money into the Centex? Richard Dugas : Mike, I'll take stab and then Bob can give you some additional color. We have 13 point risk weighted scale for the way we invest in all of our land. And all the different factors that go into that include things like the link of land transaction, whether or not we are building the same product. And the market's performance et cetera, number of factors and the return threshold range from around 20% up into the low 30% category. So our focus for when to invest in Centex is when we can generate returns in that band between 20% and 30% effectively. And the fact that we talked about repeated that we believe drive Centex over that 20% threshold is pace. Because that buyer unlike the Pulte or Del Webb buyer has a limited amount income to spend, there is only so much you can do on pricing side with the Centex buyer before you price them out of their home. So as an example if you are selling four homes a month in a Pulte community and you are selling four homes a month at a Centex community, if Pulte is generating 25% margin and Centex is generating 19% margin, it is going to take more pace than four per month in order to get those returns where we need them. So you might need six or seven homes a month in a Centex community and make that work. So that's what we are looking for. And perhaps we are beginning to see -- the beginning of that with the improvement. But it is generally pace so Bob anything you add there. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Exactly, I can say only thing and to emphasize is it is not as if we've told people don't invest in Centex today. We are agonistic to brand. So the local investment and operating team are actually evaluating transactions against each other with the capital they have to spend over time. And so what Richard has laid out plays out such that today the move up in Del Webb transactions look better to us from a return perspective, that's why we are investing. Mike Roxland : Got it. Appreciate all the color there. Can you just drill down little further though say if you look at the return threshold 20% to 30%, can you give us an idea where returns currently stand on your Centex product? And what the current paces on an absolute basis versus your targeted pace to achieve the 20% to 30% threshold? Richard Dugas : Mike, it is little complicated because a lot of land that we are sitting on for Centex, we might have acquired five years ago, some we may have acquired two years ago. So they kind of current returns -- obviously a project when it gets to the end of its life generate higher returns than in the beginning when you are putting a lot of capital in overall. I would yes we are driving each of our current communities to the highest possible return. And that's like balancing the knobs in an airliner try to adjust all the different pieces. So for Centex it might be pushing pace a little bit more than price kind of given the dynamics that have indicated. I think the commentary we are trying to provide is around new investment or future investment we need to get over that 20% return hurdle which is a way we look at it before we invest a lot of additional dollars there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut. Your line is open. Mike Rehaut : Thanks, good morning, everyone. First question I was hoping just delve in a little more granularly in terms of the gross margin component that being interest expense amortization, you had a great improvement in 2014, you listed it as one of the drivers, I think about 130 BPS. I would presume that is expected to continue to come down in 2015, I was hoping perhaps you could give us a range or an outlook for that as percent of sales. Richard Dugas : We wouldn't do it necessarily, Mike, as a percent of sales, haven't given sales guidance but what I can tell you is what we expensed in fiscal 2014 was about $195 million. And you can expect that number to come down probably to around $140 million next year. Reflective of the fact that we are -- have much less leverage, our cash spend on interest is in the neighborhood $130 million or $140 million a year. So we will get to the point where we are expensing what we are capitalizing. Mike Rehaut : And so before my second question, Richard, that $130 million, $140 million, with that kind of be where it is stabilizes unless you take a lot more debt off the balance sheets? Richard Dugas : Yes, obviously depending on what we do. So we paid down some debt this year. So what we capitalize in 2014 which will get amortized over time is less than what was capitalized the year before. So it is kind of like FIFO if you think about all the counting analogy. Mike Rehaut : Right. And then just lastly, Richard, I think you referred a couple of times to December and January trends being a little bit better. If I'm characterizing that right. A little bit momentum perhaps. I was hoping you could review the trends let say throughout the quarter? Other builders have pointed to perhaps competitive activity intensifying a little bit. And I just was curious if you had seen that yourselves because certainly the December/January commentary suggests otherwise possibly? Richard Dugas : Yes. Thanks Mike. So let me just kind of take everybody back a little bit to 2014. The year started off from a sales pace perspective I think for everybody really strong. And definitely we noticed a pause sometime in a summer that continues through most of the fall. What's notable is that around Thanksgiving things started changing. And so to answer your question, we sold virtually the same number of homes in October, November and December which candidly very rarely happens. Normally you sell lot more homes in October than you did in December and you see the quarter trail off, so that was notable in our minds. And then January has continued to be quite positive. So from a competitive activity standpoint, it is hard to say. Candidly we are not trying to play the spec inventory drive a bunch of volume, push incentives in order to drive a bunch of volume gain, so perhaps we are not focused as much on sort of what's happening from a discounting perspective as maybe others are. I can just tell you that overall buyer activity I think was weak in the beginning of Q4 and improved through Q4 based on that trend and is continued into January. Bob O'Shaughnessy: And before we move, Mike, I just want to clarify something, in terms of the interest expense side, I had indicated $140 million, you said $130 million to $140, and I would say it is probably $140 million to $150 million rather than $130 million to $140 million just for everybody's benefit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood. Your line is open. Nishu Sood : Thanks. I wanted to ask about the share repurchases. The increase in the share repurchases in the fourth quarter relative to the earlier quarters of the year. Was that driven mainly by just the seasonal cash flow is obviously stronger cash flows at the end of the year or lesser need for land purchases. What was the kind of driver? Was it opportunistic? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Well, I think we talked about this at the Investor Day. And we announced the very significant increase in the authorization. It really comes down so we have the capital to do it. As we look at the cash balance that we have -- if really interested either or conversation around land investment, so we elected to increase our spend on repurchasing shares knowing that we were increasing our spend on land as well. Richard Dugas : And Nishu as we indicated on our Investor Day, it is not our goal to try to be opportunistic. If something happens and we have that opportunity then we always have that option, but our goal is to more systematically and routinely return funds to shareholders but I'll just remind everyone, invest in the business first, dividend improvement second, accretive high return M&A third, and then repurchase is fourth. And we have a good discipline about the way we are going about that today. Nishu Sood : Got it. And the second question everyone tends to think just about Texas and oil prices. You have one of the broader footprints of the public builders. Are there any other markets you are keeping tabs on or would be potentially concerned about as it relates to lower oil prices or is it pretty much just focus on Texas? Richard Dugas : I would turn that around to tell you I am pretty optimistic about the rest of the country because of a huge tax rate that everybody just got with a lot lower gas cost annually. So clearly there are other markets that have more energy dependence if you will Nishu than others. But I don't think anyone to the same degree as Texas. And potentially California and market or two but I am personally I am optimistic that the cash flow implications for people's monthly cycle based on gas price are a positive factor from oil prices being depressed. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall. Bob Wetenhall : Good morning, and thanks for all the color. Obviously, really good quarter. Just wanted to get your view on land costs what you are seeing. Obviously, your spend flow down last year and you came in lower than your original targets. What are you seeing from land prices today and do you think that there is a possibility you might come up short and have to redeploy the excess cash elsewhere this year? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Bob, it is Bob. I don't think we slowed down our spend. We didn't spend everything we authorize and that's again consistent with the year but still a 30% increase in our spend. We are projecting another 40% if we can find an investment that makes sense. Is it possible we won't spend that much money? Yes. Just like we did in last year and I'd say the same thing we said a year ago. We are okay with that because we want people to do it, because things we are trying to give our team's visibility to is a multiyear capital allocation so that they can plan accordingly. And if we've just said okay we authorize to this year and then take it away, they will be induced to spend it because they don't want to lose it. So we think it drives better behavior to say, look, one thing we haven't shared with this group broadly is we've actually given the field three years of capital allocation. So they know today what they have for 2015, 2016 and 2017. And we will give them a view of 2018 at some point. That the idea being manage your capital over time. And so I know we all focused on this call around the current fiscal year what we are going to spend. As a company, we are actually looking longer term than that because the market is still competitive. I don't know that we would say, okay, if we spend $2 billion next year instead of what we've targeted would we then turn around and write a big dividend check or buyback a lot of stock. Not necessarily, it would be depended on what we thought we are going to do over time. Bob Wetenhall : What do you think with the land prices? Richard Dugas : Bob, it is Richard. Land prices are competitive. No question about them. Unfortunately we've got a very broad footprint. We are not -- as Bob indicated forcing investment into any particular geography. We allocate capital to geography and if we can't find right deals, we don't spend it. So land is competitive. I don't personally think that's news. And I expected to stay competitive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger. Adam Rudiger : Hi, thanks. Two questions on the Dominion acquisition. The first one was the purchase accounting impact this quarter and what is the expected impact is for next quarter? Bob O'Shaughnessy : Yes. So it is about a 70 basis point headwinds, so detrimental margin impact in the fourth quarter and our expectation is between 30 and 50 basis points in the first quarter next year. Adam Rudiger : Thank you. And the second question relates to your comments about slowing or stopping sales that Columbus and Louisville communities. How much is that -- at first glance I'll make that, we will make it sound like those were ultra strong market. So my question is, is that the case or how much of that is a philosophical or structural difference in the way you want to run the business versus how they ran the business? Richard Dugas : It is 100% the latter. Although we are happy with the markets and we think the market dynamics are good and appropriately strong. But frankly we have way too much backlog out there in front of us. So, Adam, we are very comfortable with few months of backlog. But we don't want to get seven, eight, nine months of backlog because we think we lose pricing power. It also gave us the opportunity to intensely focus on common plan management, getting our frankly more efficient plans in place and what they have been building in Dominion and then also implement some of our strategic pricing focus with lot premiums and our option focus. The teams are fantastic. They are really working hard and doing a lot of work to kind of prepare for reopening a number of communities both existing communities that we stop as well as new community. So very pleased with what's happening there. But it was just philosophical difference and frankly driving return versus growth. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Will Randow. Will Randow : Hey, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Just a follow up on the land color. I was curious if the markets like Texas in particular you are seeing competitors back off or it get less competitive in regards to land? Bob O'Shaughnessy: It is interesting. I can't say what's happen in the last 30 days but certainly have approved a number of transactions there including one of the Del Webb. And I would tell you for well positioned assets people are still interested. So it is not like the demand goes away from the builders immediately. Will Randow : Got it. And then in the South East, are you seeing competition stepped up? I would assume so based on number of acquisition among competitors. Richard Dugas : Will, it is Richard. I think the South East has been historically pretty competitive. I haven't noticed a big change in that dynamic. We happen to have some pretty dominant positions. Our two operations in North Carolina and South Carolina are fantastically run. We do very, very well there. So I'd say it is continued to be competitive but we are doing very well. Bob O'Shaughnessy: And for the extent that they bought somebody, it is just different name but they are still the same builder there with the same lot position initially. So it doesn't change the competitive landscape immediately. Operator : There are no further questions. Presenters, I turn the call back to you. Jim Zeumer : Great, thank you, Shawn. I know there is a lot of conference call lined up today. Sorry we ran a little bit long in this call. We wanted to get in as many people as we could. We are certainly be available for the remainder of the day if you got any follow up questions. Thank you for your time. And we look forward to speaking with you in next quarter. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Inc First Quarter 2015 Financial Results. All lines have been placed on mute in order to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn our call over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead. James P. Zeumer: Thank you, Ryan, and good morning to everyone participating today. I want to welcome you to PulteGroup\u2019s conference call to discuss our first quarter financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Joining me for today's call are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Vice President and Financing Controller. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slide that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We'll also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later today. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all the participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statement about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. This risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard? Richard J. Dugas: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. During our last conference call we commented about seeing a strengthening of demand starting midway through the fourth quarter and carrying into the first few weeks of January. I\u2019m pleased to report that the momentum and demand which began building in Q4 continued through the first quarter and has gotten the spring selling season off to a good start. Since the housing cycle turned positive several years ago we\u2019ve stated our belief that unlike recoveries in the past we didn\u2019t expect to see a rapid V shaped rebound. Our expectations were that this would be a longer more gradual recovery with periods of faster and slower growth but with an overall upward bias consistent with the sustained rebound in housing demand. The early read on the industry's 2015 spring selling season it is that we\u2019re now in one of those periods of improving demand. Having participated in a number investor meetings over the past couple of months, one of the questions we\u2019re often asked is what has been the catalyst for the improvement in the country\u2019s housing demand. In the absence of a single dramatic change in any of the underlying demand factors it is likely a culmination and continuation of market dynamics. First, with Boomers and Millennials acting as powerful bookends certainly the demographics are favorable and supportive of an ongoing rebound in demand. Millennials maybe doing things later but their desire for home ownership is well documented and our strong Centex results which Bob will discuss shortly support this thesis. Turning to active adults with the youngest boomers just now passing 50, this group remains a tremendous source of future demand and our Del Webb brand is unmatched in its ability to serve these buyers. Second, interest rates remain low and with recent cuts in FHA fees the monthly payment has become a little less expensive for many potential homeowners. The mortgage market generally remains tight and we don\u2019t expect any material change in credit availability anytime soon but every little bit helps as our Centex results suggest. And third, consumer sentiment and the job market trends have certainly been positive with more than 3 million jobs created over the past year. While these numbers jump around from month-to-month there are clear signs that point to an improving economy and a rising number of household formations. Looking ahead along with more jobs we\u2019d like to start seeing more wage inflation which should make it easier for would-be home buyers to afford a mortgage. Given the acceleration in US housing demand in the early stages of spring selling season our expectations are that the strengthening of demand is sustainable and should drive better new home sales for all of 2015. Like the overall industry PulteGroup experienced strong demand in Q1 and is well positioned to deliver yet another year of strong operating and financial performance in 2015. First quarter sign-ups of 5,139 homes were up 6% over last year on a 5% increase in community count. I am pleased by the fact that we were able to increase sales while maintaining high absorption paces without pushing incentives meaningfully during the period. Consistent with our value creation strategy having strong sign-ups per community at high margins is a more efficient business model for PulteGroup in trying to drive volume aggressively. Our continued steady improvement in return on invested capital these last several years indicates our strategy is working. One of the things we have emphasized during this housing cycle is the need to focus on better located properties which typically mean staying with the better closer end locations and within established areas of buyer interest. For the most part buyer demand in the secondary locations throughout our markets remain tepid. So even though the land may be cheaper, it doesn\u2019t necessarily make it a good investment for us. The strong margin performance we continue to enjoy is partly the result of sticking to our land investment discipline. Speaking of land investment the 5% increase in community count that we reported understates the amount of activity actually taking place in terms of getting new communities open. In the first quarter we grand opened almost 60 new neighborhoods which keeps us on track with previous guidance that we expect to open upwards of 200 new communities in 2015. Turning over 10% of our communities in a quarter is a lot of work especially in today\u2019s environment were entitlement and land development delays grow increasingly common. We of course track the progress and performance of our communities in relationship to their original project plans and a number of the communities end up running behind schedule in terms of when they register their first sign-up. Still through a lot of hard work for our land teams we are getting the job done and I am optimistic we can reach our community count guidance for this year. We are encouraged by market conditions during the closing months of 2014 and through the first few months of 2015 and remain positive about expected housing trends for the next several years.  Now, let me turn over the call to Bob for a detailed review of our first quarter results. Bob? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Against the backdrop of improving conditions that Rich discussed, our first quarter operating results were in line with our expectations and with the guidance we provided on our last call. More importantly our Q1 results have well positioned to deliver another year of excellent operating and financial results. Looking at our first quarter numbers home-building revenues were $1.1 billion which is consistent with last year. Our current quarter revenues reflected 2% or $6700 increase in average selling price to $323,000 offset by 2% decrease in closing the 3365 homes. Our conversion rates in the first quarter dropped from the prior-year as the production was negatively impacted by a number of factors including weather in certain markets which hindered land development and house construction, a continuing challenging municipal entitlement environment, and tight labor resources. We expect that we will be able to get our production related closings back on schedule over the balance of the year with the majority of the delayed closings occurring in the third and fourth quarters. The 2% increase in average selling price for the quarter was driven by price increases realized in each of our brand with Centex being up 2% to $208,000 and Pulte and Del Webb each increasing by less than 1% to $387,000 and $325,000 respectively. On a year-over-year basis, we saw a continuation of recent trends in our mix as Pulte continued to increase as a percentage of our total closings. More specifically closings in the first quarter break down as follows : 45% of closings from Pulte, 30% from Del Webb and 25% from Centex. This compares to 41%, 32% and 27% in the first quarter of last year, but it\u2019s consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. Gross margins for the first quarter was 22.7% which is down a 110 basis points from last year, but it is in line with the 2015 outlook we provided on our fourth quarter earnings call. Our Q1 margin reflects higher land, labor and material costs as well as the impact of acquisition accounting associated with the Dominion transaction which impacted our Q1 margin by approximately 30 basis points. These headwinds were partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from our deleveraging over the last two years. Looking at option revenues and lot premiums in the quarter, we continue to realize higher dollars on both lines. In the quarter option revenues per closing increased 13% or $5700 over the prior year, while lot premiums in the period increased by 3% or $400. Sales discounts in the quarter totaled 2.2% per home which is up about 60 basis points from last year, a little change for the fourth quarter. Given our strong Q1 margin performance along with ongoing opportunities from our value creation initiatives and our positive view of the market we continue to target full-year 2015 gross margins of approximately 23%. As we\u2019ve said in the past there will be movement in margins up or down as we move from quarter-to-quarter and dependent upon the mix of closings. SG&A costs in the first quarter totaled $161 million or 14.8% of home sale revenues compared with $145 million or 13.3% of home sale revenue last year. The higher SG&A spend in the period reflects investments we\u2019re making in people and information systems as well as increased start-up cost associated with the large number of new communities we are opening this year. The overhead spend in Q1 was consistent with previous guidance for 2015 SG&A expenditures to be in the range of $160 million to $165 million per quarter. Our financial services operations reported first quarter pretax income of $5 million compared with $22 million last year. Note that last year\u2019s pretax income included $19 million benefit related to the reversal of mortgage repurchase reserves. Capture rate for the period improved 82% up from 78% last year. Our reported Q1 income tax expense of $41 million represents an effective tax rate of 42.6% which is higher than our previous guidance of 38%. The higher tax rate for the period reflects the charge of $0.02 per share relating to an adjustment to our deferred tax assets resulting from a change in our perspective effective tax rate due to tax planning initiatives. We currently estimate that the company normalized rate for future quarter this year will remain year our previous guidance of 38%. On the bottom line the first quarter net income was $55 million or $0.15 per share compared with net income $75 million or $0.19 per share last year. Note that our prior year results include $0.02 per share of net benefit relating to the reverse of mortgage repurchase reserves which was partially offset by charges in connection with debt retirement activity. Shipping to homebuilding operations the company had 5387 homes under construction at the end of the quarter of which 19% respect. As a percentage construction activity this is comparable with the prior year. At the end of March our finish spec inventory totaled over 345 homes so we continue to maintain a tight control on our spec production. In the first quarter we improved approximately 2000 lots for purchase and finish the period with the 135,000 lots under control. Our lot position includes 39,000 lots controlled under option. This represents 29% of our lots which is up from less than 26% last year. Of our controlled lots approximately 23% are finished with 18% currently underdeveloped. We spent $484 million on land in the quarter of which 49% was for development of exciting position and 51% was for acquisition. That spend rate is behind our full year authorization at $2.4 billion, this is due to the fact that the timeline in a number of land transactions have gotten longer as municipal accruals and/or land development is taking more time, but we still have a lot in the pipeline and are working hard to get deals approved and into production. Even though housing demand in 2014 was up only slightly over the prior year, land prices did not retreat and according to our division President have actually risen in 75% of our markets. As we\u2019ve consistently indicated we intend to remain disciplined in our investment in the business and only fund projects that meet our return thresholds. In support our broader value creation objectives we continue allocating capital consistent with the priorities we articulated most recently at our investment day. First to invest in the business and pay dividends then to opportunistic M&A of any excess funds being returned to shareholders in the form of share repurchase activity. During the quarter we repurchased 4.6 million shares for a $100 million or $21.75 per share. This level of activity is comparable to Q4 and reflects a stated strategy of being systematic in our approach to share buyback rather than trying time to market. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and with the debt to capital ratio of 28%. Our debt to cap is unchanged from the prior year. I will note that we're likely to use the portion of our cash to retire $238 million in bonds which mature in the second quarter of this year. We passed the balance sheet with sign-ups in the quarter increased 6% to 5,139 homes. On a dollar basis sign-up revenue increased 6% to $1.7 billion. By brand unit sign-ups increased 13% at Pulte, and 6% at Centex and decreased 7% at Del Webb. The decrease at Del Webb is due to the close out of a number of selling efforts in Del Webb communities. Absorption phases increased 8% at Centex and were essentially flat at Pulte and Del Webb. We are certainly encouraged by the improved sales pace among entry level buyers and particularly in some of our largest Centex communities which are experiencing notable increase in sales phase. For the quarter we operated from 613 communities which is up 5% from the same period last year. We continue to forecast operating from approximately 620 communities in each quarter of the year and are on track to open over 200 new communities in 2015. One last data point we ended the quarter with a backlog of 7,624 homes valued at $2.6 billion which is up from 7,199 homes valued at $2.4 billion in March of last year. Now let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments. Richard J. Dugas: Thanks Bob, as I talked about at the beginning of the call for a variety of factors the spring selling season was off to a very good start with improving traffic, manageable inventories and select pricing opportunities across many of the markets we serve. At a regional level many of the trends we have discussed during the number of the previous earnings conference calls continue to develop during the first quarter of 2015. More specifically on the East Coast we saw very solid demand up and down the coast with Florida and the Southeast experiencing strong buyer interest throughout the period while demand improved in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets as the quarter progressed. Once again the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida realized the strongest demand some of which was likely people looking to escape yet another harsh winter. Heading towards the middle of the country conditions in the Midwest were generally stable for the quarter although like the East we did see demand improved slightly as the quarter progressed. As I know it\u2019s an area of focus let me spend a little extra time on Texas. In total Texas sign-ups were down 5% in the quarter mostly as a result of the closeout of several large communities in Austin and San Antonio which would be yet to be replaced. Demand in Dallas held up reasonably well while Austin and San Antonio were slightly weaker in the quarter. Specific to Houston sales in the quarter were flat with the prior year although demand slowed as the quarter progressed particularly at the higher price points. So far the impact of lower oil prices seems manageable and with oil prices seeming to a bottom we are optimistic that Texas will continue to be a strong market. Our West conditions held up well during the quarter, but the market, the submarket and the community location all matter as we continue to experienced better demand on a coast of California and we close certain locations around Phoenix, Las Vegas and Albuquerque. On our last call we mentioned our newest Del Webb community called [indiscernible] and Albuquerque. The community comprises 550 homes roughly seven miles from downtown. The community which is open very well is part of an expanding portfolio of projects designed to serve active adult buyers, we want to be closer to a city center and the amenity such locations offer. In the coming quarters and years I expect you will see us open more communities for active adults expanding a variety of sizes, amenity offerings, locations and brands. Overall, we are pleased with our demand developed in the quarter and during the first few weeks of April. We are particularly encouraged by the improved experience in our Centex communities. We are optimistic that this is the beginning of a more substantial recovery in the entry level which is really missing piece of the housing recovery to date. Assuming there are no dramatic changes in the U.S. or globally to have a material impact on employment trends, consumer confidence or interest rates, new home sales should see continued gains in 2015. PulteGroup is also well positioned to see improved operating and financial performance as the quarters progressed given the opportunity for increasing margins and greater overhead leverage as delivery volume increased over the course of the year, particularly in the third and fourth quarters. As the year progresses we will continue to advance our key value creation initiatives and focus on delivering high returns on invested capital. At the end of our formal remarks by recognizing and thanking all of our employees for their tireless efforts to deliver a great home buying experience to our customers everyday. Our success only possible through your passionate commitment. Now, I turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James P. Zeumer: Thank you, Richard. We will now open the call for questions. So that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Ryan, if you explain the process, we will get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Dahl : Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask I guess Houston being a big topic and a wide range of comments so far from some of the builders that you guys are one of the few to talk about some slowing, but it seems to be very dependent on submarkets, so I was wondering if you could just specify kind of which submarkets within Houston not just that price point but kind of around the area have you seen the impacts trying to get a sense of how isolated it is or broad. Richard J. Dugas: Mike, this is Richard, in talking to our leadership team it's fairly consistent around the whole Metro area of Houston, but as indicated higher price points seem to be a little bit slower. We're very pleased with demand of the lower price points. But I wouldn\u2019t note any particular submarkets has been stronger or weaker than others. Michael Dahl : Got it. And I guess if you - the comment on Houston being flat for the quarter, but then demand slowing through, is there any sense if you\u2019d give us in terms of magnitude so that January started up year-over-year and then February and March were down by how much? Richard J. Dugas: No, I think the reason we noted it Mike is that typically you would see stronger demand in March then you would say in February or January and we did not see that through the quarter. I don\u2019t have any specific on exactly how many units it was I would point out that but Houston is an important market for us we go very balanced portfolio throughout not only Houston but also through the state of Texas in the country. So frankly we are not particularly worried about it and continue to like the overall benefit that lower oil prices give a whole country as opposed to the headwinds potentially for Houston. Michael Dahl : Right, okay, thank you. Richard J. Dugas: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael J. Rehaut: Thanks, good morning everyone. Richard J. Dugas: Hello, Mike. Michael J. Rehaut: First question I had was just on pricing trends; you noted I believe at the beginning of your remarks Richard that you didn't push meaningfully in terms of incentives to achieve the sales that you were able to book, so I was hoping maybe to get a little more granular if there's any regions that maybe saw pricing power a little better than expected I guess outside of the regional commentary that you gave just specific to prices and incentives if there are any trends that you know maybe surprised a little bit to the upside or downside? Richard J. Dugas: Yes, Mike, it\u2019s Richard again, good question. I think as opposed to regional trends which frankly we felt that the country was pretty consistent what we continue to be pleased with is our ability to drive option revenue and lot premiums higher and this is the multiple quarters in a row that Bob has commented that we have been able to take those numbers up. That\u2019s indicative of a fairly healthy market. As we indicated in our prepared remarks we do have higher input cost land as an example coming through the income statement which everybody does. But I would say we generally believe that the pricing environment is more favorable than not as we go through the balance of the year. So we are optimistic as we indicated we are guiding for 23% margins for the year implying a little bit of growth through the balance of the year so we feel good about pricing. Michael J. Rehaut: Great, no, I appreciate that. I guess the second question, you highlighted the sales pace by brand and Centex kind of standing out there a little bit. Bob we talked about in the past kind of your focus on exploring opportunities for building the Centex brand or building that out a little bit potentially to the extent of that market appears to be a little bit more favorable and I know that absorption was a big component of whether or not the economics might become more favorable. I was hoping maybe you could talk about the \u2013 kind of where you are in the process of exploring greater opportunities for Centex, obviously there was also a slide on the Investor Day about kind of looking at that brand in 2015 for land opportunities and obviously the economics have to work. So any thoughts around that would be helpful. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, you are exactly right, Mike, we are focused on it as a buyer group in the whole of the Millennials and so we are doing some strategic work around how to approach that marketplace. In terms of how we buy land around that \u2013 that hasn\u2019t changed, we are still focused on returns and what we're seeing still to this point is that closer in is where people are choosing to live and so we are seeing better opportunities to drive paces at prices that make sense in that move up space and in the active adult space. I think if we continue to see absorption rates increasing with solid pricing in the first time I think it will make more land available or attractive for that buyer group. So certainly we're focused on it because it is such a big cohort I wouldn't say we've seen a change in our buying patterns around that, but we are looking at ways to serve that group more specifically. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open. Stephen S. Kim: Yes, thanks very much guys. Stephen Kim from Barclays. Let me just follow-up if I could on the margin trajectory improving over the course of the year comment. I think you are talking about gross margins as well as SG&A and I just wanted to ask about how margins typically progress through the year, I mean generally a lot of builders first quarter gross margins are generally lower just by the virtue of the fact that you have some marketing expenses associated with community rollout but you don\u2019t have as many deliveries and that kind of thing. And I was wondering if that dynamic was actually going to be at work this year also and if that is kind of what is giving you confidence about your gross margin maybe improving sequentially from what we saw this quarter? Or if there is something else at work? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Well, I think Stephen the commentary was actually around gross margins, not operating margins, so SG&A wouldn\u2019t be part of that, so our SG&A we\u2019ve confirmed that we still think that 160 to 165 a quarter is a good number. And in terms of the gross margins itself as we look at the backlog and as we look at the overall housing in market and the fact that we will no longer have kind of suppression that came from the purchase accounting that we see opportunity and candidly we\u2019ve obviously guided to a higher annual rate that we have in the first quarter. So we think that the margins are actually going to be a little bit higher through the balance of the year; mix always matters to that so if there was a larger proportion of first time closings that can move that a little bit, but I don\u2019t think it moves it much on the whole. I don\u2019t know Richard if do you want to\u2026 Richard J. Dugas: No, I think that\u2019s exactly right. I just wanted to \u2013 you already said it Bob, clarified that we were speaking to gross margins, not operating here. Stephen S. Kim: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful, so you\u2019re [indiscernible] incorporating very much mix in that, but you are assuming that you are going to see some lift from the abatement of the purchase accounting, that kind of stuff. Okay, my second question relates to a comment you made about land prices being up in 75% of the markets I think you indicated that your folks are telling you. I was curious if you could give a little more color around that, is that a year-over-year comment, if so, how about sequentially, what are prices done in land because I think that you know land prices probably aren\u2019t that seasonal I would think, and which markets are you seeing that and I assume that\u2019s consistent with what you are buying also. So just some color around the land price comment. Robert O'Shaughnessy: It certainly is year-over-year and certain degree \u2013 I mean its what folks are telling us they are seeing as they got negotiate land transaction, three quarters of the country our footprint in the country I would tell you is most of our markets and so I wouldn\u2019t want to call one out versus another. I guess the point being really and we\u2019ve said it for a couple of years now land doesn\u2019t move quite as quickly down as it does up and there is I think again for the types of land parcels that we're interested in a competitive landscape. So we are working hard to make sure we buy in terms of that make sense and can support the returns that are \u2013 has set out as being requirements due to transaction and for those attracted parcels it\u2019s a competitive set. Richard J. Dugas: And Bob I would just add that we clearly believe our land buying discipline is very, very helpful to returns its also one of the regions that our margins not only are among industry leader several 100 basis points higher than many in the space, but also the reason that we continue to guide for a more positive margin trajectory versus the industry and we believe at the land discipline serves as well. For it\u2019s not about a lot of unit volume although we are pleased with the volume performance it\u2019s about higher returns the combination of the appropriate volume and strong margins. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Robert C Wetenhall : Hey, good morning. Richard J. Dugas: Hi, Bob. Robert C Wetenhall : Good morning, just wanted to ask you in terms of ASP trends it seems like decelerating and I was trying to understand is just more a function of a mix shift or is it function that\u2019s you had really strong pricing gains in 2014, so the comps are tougher. Richard J. Dugas: Bob, this is Richard. That\u2019s a great question, two things there. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the comps are little bit tougher, but we did have an unusually core mix of closings in Q1 relative to ASP and frankly we don\u2019t think we did it great job highlighting that last call. So the numbers were down pretty substantially simply do to mix. So as I indicated earlier one of the earlier questions we are pleased with pricing trends and you see that through premiums and options trends overall. So it\u2019s a little bit about but we did have a particular weak Q1 mix. Robert C Wetenhall : Is that makes reverse then. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Hey, just would find point on that \u2013 think about the way the closing sequence works we are going get more closing from warm weather places which typically at lower ASP so its not mix by brands its really geography to drive that. If you look at our backlog you know ASP in the backlog is consistent year-over-year today. So March versus March and it actually up from December. Robert C Wetenhall : Okay. So I am thinking you are saying that\u2019s going to reverse as we move forward correct or start to improve. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Right so that the backlog ASP today as I think 335 or $6000 versus the ASP that we actually printed at 323 in the first quarter. Again, geographic matters and were the closings are coming from. Robert C Wetenhall : Got it, got it that\u2019s really helpful. And just a follow up you guys got out construction delays negative impacted deliveries. Some trying to think through that and Richard also mentioned the commentary about the difficult you permitting, which I think it lead to extension deliveries, from a timeframe standpoint. Does that me that some of the product you expected to bring online in 1Q actually is going to role in the second calendar quarter instead. So it sound like demand destruction so should we see benefit in 2Q as you are able to result construction delays no it just look in for little granularity what kind of delays you guys are mentioning in it sounds like a transitory problem is suppose to something recurring. Thanks. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Bob your are exactly right and its related to just being an able to get the homes close, no change in overall demand trends overall there we simply missed some units below our expectation in Q1 and most of that make up is going to be in Q3 and Q4. We will get about what we expected in Q2 but the make up unfortunately just given sort of the push and timing we are expecting the vast majority of that in the second half of the year. So it is transitory your timing issue having nothing to do with overall market demand. Operator : Your next question Ivy Zelman from Zelman and Associates. Your line is open. Ivy Zelman : Hey guys good morning. Richard J. Dugas: Hi, Ivy. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Hi, Ivy. Ivy Zelman : I understand on Centex product offering in terms of your 200 I think you get 208,000 average price with FHA available at pretty reasonable underwriting 580 if I go you talking about 3.5% down in the back end ratio at plus 50%. Richard you mentioned tight underwriting I guess what you think its tight about that and then secondly as you think about the impairment to extending the Centex brand and getting more absorption is it more impairment because your land doesn\u2019t pencil to the return or what actually happened because I don\u2019t think you are going to see anymore favorable underwriting to FHA right now [indiscernible] about it. Richard J. Dugas: Yes, Ivy we agree with you on that FHA is clearly accommodated for the Centex brand. It is more land underwriting criteria kind of to one of the earlier questions it\u2019s about pace coming back strongly enough to support the kind of returns we want. I will say we are optimistic with what we\u2019ve seen in Q1 and our markets are really watching that and the potential to invest further in that category I think is rising. One of the thing I know as Bob indicated earlier in the middle of studying this category in detail, we are actually breaking that study into two different portions. One, we\u2019re calling the urban millennial buyer and the other we\u2019re calling sort of the suburban value buyer and we do think that both of those categories behave a little bit differently. But later this year we are going to have more color on what we believe drives those of course we are watching the market overall, so we're optimistic that we could see a change in our investment portfolio over time we have not yet and we are still seeing vast majority of our land transactions at Pulte, but yes we agree that FHA is accommodated for the inter-level buyer. With regard to the comment around tight underwriting criteria however it is very, very clear that credit in our opinion is two types in general and we are also and we put in our prepared remarks don\u2019t think you are going to see much change in that regard, but that has to do with QM and QRM just being a very tight underwriting box overall and that\u2019s why we are making that comment. Ivy Zelman : And I appreciate, thank you for that. On the tightness, can you be more specific because even within QM I think that the question is, is it really tight or is it just a self employed barrowers and for a national, what specific about QM would you say that\u2019s tight [indiscernible] 3% down, 6.25 go backend ratios. I think people when everybody talks about tight it\u2019s hard for us to understand what that really means? Richard J. Dugas: Yes, Ivy I think you are right the construct of the offering is good, it\u2019s the underwriting discursion or lack there I think we are talking about, so whether it\u2019s credit overlays or just an inability for the people who are underwriting loans to say I see a blemish and I understand it and I can document around it. People aren\u2019t really willing to do that yet and so the rep and warrant issue that has been sort of an overhanging the industry we believe still impacts loan generation. So that tightness we are talking about isn\u2019t around the product or how affordable it is or how accessible it is to a particular buyer group, it\u2019s really that \u2013 it\u2019s tough to get a mortgage approved. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Jack Micenko for SIG. Your line is open. Jack Micenko : Hi, good morning guys. Looking at the \u2013 the cadence of buyback so I think we are running what\u2019s call it 50 million in the first three quarter of last year and kind of stepped up to $100 million number through the first quarter. I am just thinking say systematic is because the question is systematic the 100 going forward or 50 how do we think about that on a go forward basis. Richard J. Dugas: Hi, I think we haven\u2019t given any forward guidance on that and we look at candidly as we go through the year. I think the fact that we now done a couple of quarters that $100 million is indicative of what we are thinking for 2015. Because the only thing offer on top of that is as we look at our cash position and we look at our cash generation and what we are going to utilize our cash for we will adjust that over time. So as we for instance go through our reforecasting process each quarter here we look at what is our cash position. How much we are going to be investing in the business what we are getting need to run the business and obviously $1 billion in cash still higher than we would like to carry. Jack Micenko : Heard I thanks. Richard J. Dugas: Here just talk about that will use cash actually to likely pay down the debt that matures in the second quarter. Again we are looking at ways to trying utilize some of the cash. Jack Micenko : Okay great. And then just to confirm there is no more go forward \u2013 impact in the gross margin. Richard J. Dugas: Yes we work through the - with that we acquire which is what has really challenged margins. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Stephen East : Thanks good morning guys. It like follow up on Jack question just a little bit. Associate with capital allocation in your ROI see target first on the ROI see do you all have target out there you are willing to share maybe or at least that progression of how you expect this is to go over the next few years and then given what\u2019s you all have been taking about seeing much higher land costs, probably not running \u2013 probably not getting out over year skews on community growth et cetera. Are you starting to is you cash allocation starting to the [indiscernible] starting to move away from reinvestment toward that that pay down and return to shareholders are you still where are you still pretty much in the same type of the mode if you will. Richard J. Dugas: Stephen this is Richard. I would say a couple of things. We clearly intend and optimistic that we can drive returns higher in the coming years. We don\u2019t have a particular target out there other than that is crystal clear throughout the organization that our view is to our number one goal financial is to drive higher returns. With regard to allocation we are very consistent we go we said our December Investor Day our first priority is to invest in the business and we are pleased with getting our communities open and we\u2019re pleased with the ability we believe to hit our targeted committee count for the year. That\u2019s our number one goal. Second is to continue to fund an increasing dividend, third is any opportunistic M&A and then residual cash on a very systematic basis back to shareholders. So that last one is going to fluctuate depending on our ability to invest in the business and as Bob indicated we stepped up here in the last couple of quarters. So we feel like we're doing exactly what we said we would we're very pleased with our performance we\u2019re pleased with the environment, we\u2019re pleased with the quarter we feel like we\u2019re doing exactly what we said we will be doing. Stephen East : Okay, that\u2019s fair enough. Robert O'Shaughnessy: The only thing I would add to that Steve if you would focused on the debt repayment we got a maturity here in the second quarter I think it's $238 million not really a big enough bite for us to say let\u2019s refinance it so I think what we\u2019re looking at is we got cash we\u2019ll pay it down, we\u2019ve got a bigger maturity stack next year, it\u2019s little bit under $500 million. And so I think if you think us, you\u2019d see us looking at structuring leverage sometime over the next six to nine months \u2013 market conditions that were some activity this week that price pretty attractively. So the markets are still accommodative, so we will be looking at that over the next call it year, but for this maturity it just seems to us, we got the cash, we will use it and then be opportunistic and then we access after that. Stephen East : Okay, yes, thanks. And then just one more time on Centex you did push it a little bit more you said you saw some better demand out there, is maybe if you could talk a little bit about that the demand which you are seeing and this Centex really become much more of a 216 and 217 type story versus later this year. And if I can squeeze one other, do you mind ranking on the cost you said land, labor and materials. I assume the pressure on the gross margin is in that order, but if you could clarify it. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, so from a Centex perspective Steven, we are pleased with what we\u2019ve seen I think it\u2019s a little too early to say whether it\u2019s a 16 or 17 story more than this year, we have some large communities that are absorbing nicely throughout Texas, throughout the Southeast and in the Midwest and number of markets so we're feeling good about that. And with regard to margins just you know one comment over there we feel like land pressure is definitely coming through. But in terms of the comment that you are making we are very pleased with the margins you are right in the guidance range that we have they continue to be among the industry leaders, and we're guiding for flat to up margins from here. So we\u2019re very pleased with that there is a lot of commentary out there about margins down. But we are right where we want to be and we intend to stay at or near the industry leaders. And then just one other thing on Centex just to be clear, we have not invested a lot in Centex over the past couple of years. So the likelihood of Centex continues to be a smaller portion of our deliveries in the coming quarters is still there and that\u2019s okay. It will take some time to invest in Centex in the current timeframe reported manifest itself and we are watching the markets clearly to see when that happens. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Your line is open. Susan Maklari : Good morning. Richard J. Dugas: Good morning Susan. Susan Maklari : Can you talk a little bit about material cost and any trends that we should be expecting as we go though the year especially given the decline that we\u2019ve seen in some of the prices? Richard J. Dugas: Yes, we obviously keep tracking everybody else and the good news is that for the significant majority of our material input cost, we see either flatter even in some release as number gets talked about a lot of the packages are trending nicely maybe the one out layer that is concrete where we would see some price pressure. So all in all I think we had talked about coming into the year maybe 1% increase in pricing and we\u2019ve certainly see that or maybe even a little bit better I don\u2019t know I think it was backwards, but it\u2019s not working against us in a large sense so a positive results there. Susan Maklari : Okay, that\u2019s great. And then in terms of the mortgage market there is some big changes that are coming later this year in this summer and August, can you just talk a little bit about how you are working with your lenders to just make sure that some of them \u2013 there maybe a potential forward of the short-term bump that we see from that the avoided? Richard J. Dugas: Yes, it\u2019s a great question, so [indiscernible] here talked about August first is the date goes live and there are lot of people and lot of companies working really hard on this. It\u2019s kind of a complete reboot of the documentation process and we don\u2019t use a lot of outside lenders obviously so our mortgage company has been diligently working on this for months since they announced it last year. We feel good about our ability to serve under the new guidelines, so I would tell you it should be business as usual for the Pulte mortgage company. If you are looking for things that could happen the possibility exist that not everybody is going to get there because it is a big undertaking and so for instances if we got a consumer that\u2019s trading out of another home that has to sell their home, if their buyers lender isn\u2019t able to close. So you might see some ripple through the industry around that. So I think we feel good about our ability to meet and serve under the new trader rules and regulations but this is a big deal. I've had a characterized me as it's more disruptive to the mortgage industry than the cumulative Dodd\u2013Frank impact. And think about all the Dodd\u2013Frank encompass so this is a big undertaking. I would read certain survey I don\u2019t know if there is a right or wrong that close to half of the mortgage then might not be ready to do this. So we are will be ready to land but it\u2019s a big undertaking. Susan Maklari : Yes, okay that\u2019s great color thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nishu Sood : Thanks first question I want to ask was about SG&A. You mentioned the 160 to 165 range persisting, the typically with your closing rising as they year went on you would expecting other various components to drive a little bit higher. So how should we think about that the investments you mentioned the community turnover. Although going to decline at rate that with an offset closing is driven variable component of that because you mentioned obviously that your community is you are going to open 200 I think 60 is in the first quarter. So how should we think about all that? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, so if you look at the increase in our SG&A year-over-year about third of that increase we would contribute to community count opening. On top of that you\u2019ve got the other two thirds being for people that characterize of that way. Some of them are community oriented so its in relation to opening new communities and other are so we talked about we made investments in IT training quality and so I would I think you will heard to say over time is that hour SG&A spend is not as variable as many. So this is something that we have pretty good visibility into the people and the processes that we are investing into improve and to enhance the value creation this is we have underway or largely going to be fixed going forward. So the people that we are hiring should work on the projects in IT that example to work on the training will be ongoing cost. And obviously we have pretty good visibility into our planned openings in the spend on community so we think we have pretty good inside to what\u2019s happening in 2015 going forward obviously depending on how many new communities we have we will give you some color into variability of that expense each year. Nishu Sood : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Second question you mentioned Richard some weather effect in the first quarter on closing so I mentioned there would be a little bit of get back in the second question you mentioned Richard some weather effect in the first quarter on closing. So I mention that would be a little bit of give back in the second quarter, my question was around demand though was there any effect related to weather as you saw it and demand for the first quarter I guess in that context it might be helpful also if you any comments about April and whether is any snapback or rebound. Richard J. Dugas: Just two comments there we did indicate we miss some closings in Q1 and you referenced and coming back in Q2 we have been clear on this call most of them are coming back in Q3 and Q4, just FYI. No there was no demand impact from weather in Q1, we are very pleased with demand it exceeded our expectations. We are pleased with the sales volume we had and we are also pleased with April. April appears to be unfolding at a normal seasonal rate which is a good selling month. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Will Randow from Citigroup. Your line is open. Will Randow : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Richard J. Dugas: Hi, Will. Will Randow : On the number of homes in control near develop or developed lots. Can you talk about that\u2019s trended over the past 12 months and how that might impact community count going forward? Richard J. Dugas: I would say I had hard time hear you actually well. Robert O'Shaughnessy: I think he was asking what happened to control lots over the past several quarters and how that\u2019s going to impact community count side. Richard J. Dugas: I think I can answer the first part. Community count we still feel very good about our ability to be between 600 and 620 for each of the fourth quarters this year. I think Bob has got a little commentary on control lots. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, our control lots have been [indiscernible] its relatively flat for the last couple of years when we have been replacing lots as we deliver them. We are up about 8,000 lots and in terms of \u2013 if you think about what\u2019s happening inside that we are working through some older Del Webb community and we saw our Del Webb community count drop a little bit and we\u2019re replacing and essentially with Pulte community, so you see that community count increased over the last several year. But again 8,000 lots in last 12 months. And I would characterize that as largely flat. Will Randow : Thanks for that and just one follow-up with option revenues reaching 13% in the quarter what do you think that can go over the next year particularly as a mix of closing changes. Richard J. Dugas: Yes, will that\u2019s tough to put a number on candidly, we do track every single market and every single community and we still have an emphasis in that area. And I would say we still have some opportunity. I can\u2019t give you specific number. I will just tell you that it\u2019s crystal clear around the organization that we are doing our best to drive returns. And clearly option revenue and lot premium revenue help. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Mccanless from Sterne, Agee. Your line is open. Jay Mccanless : Hi, good morning everyone. First question with the incentives going up on a year-over-year basis do you guys expect that to continue through the year? Robert O'Shaughnessy: We are talking about this probably 18 months now Jay, we have gotten incentives down to I think the one point was made here 1.5% or 6% which might be the comp working year-over-year and we\u2019re at 2.1% last fourth quarter, we\u2019re 2.2% now running between $5000 and $7000 a unit, we are not seeing anything I think you heard Richard talk about the current sales environment, we are not seeing big increases in incentives. So our expectation, since we are not doing spec business is that you really see that material. Jay Mccanless : Okay, great. That\u2019s all I have, thanks. Richard J. Dugas: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Your line is open. Megan McGrath : Good morning, thanks. Just wanted to get a little bit more clarity on this Centex comment to be better for us I just wanted to clarify you did say that absorptions were flat year-over-year in the quarter in Centex? Robert O'Shaughnessy: No, I said they are up 8% Megan. Megan McGrath : Up 8%, okay. Robert O'Shaughnessy: They were flat for Web and Pulte. Megan McGrath : Flat for Web and Pulte. Okay, and then could you talk about that a little bit more was there any sort of geography that you saw that tickup or whether really nationwide that you saw that incremental improvement? Richard J. Dugas: Well, we don\u2019t have Centex communities in all of our markets from where we did we saw a pretty robust change. Texas was good, the Southeast was good and that where a lot of our Centex product is, so it wasn\u2019t isolated to anyone market. Megan McGrath : Great, and then could you just for clarification give your cancellation rates for the quarter. Richard J. Dugas: 11%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Mark Weintraub : Thank you, just on the material side where we have seen pretty dramatic drops in lumber and structural panels pricing in the last couple of months, what would that show up in your cost of goods sold, is that going to be six months from now or is it really third quarter, fourth quarter where you would potentially see the benefits of that? Richard J. Dugas: Yes, typically you are going to see what we are contracting today we\u2019ll deliver in six months and so I think that\u2019s \u2013 and based on what we buy, we have kind of a trailing pricing grid. So you would see benefit for current sales I should say changes in commodity pricing. Mark Weintraub : And then how much of an offset if any might the tightness in labor that you were talking about factor and relative to where your expectations are been, it does seem that materials maybe lower than you thought, but is labor potentially going to be an offset or do you have any view on that. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes that will be market-by-market candidly so in markets that are busier you are going to see more labor pressure, you know obviously we still, we are one of the biggest builders in every market we operate in. So we got leverage capability with our trade, but if there is a lot of activity out there, sometimes we have to pay to get them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open. Buck Horne : Thanks good morning. Let me just talk a little bit about Del Webb just wondering why you think the biggest impediment is to improve absorptions at Del Webb right now. I am little surprised given the demographics and the weather patterns and just a strength of Florida and some other markets, why you are not getting a little bit more improvement there, what\u2019s \u2013 can you guess a little more explanation with what you think going on at Del Webb. Richard J. Dugas: Buck, again absorptions have been steadily increasing throughout the last couple of years there and they were flat this time. So we are not disappointed in Del Webb overall we did have quite a few communities absorption selling efforts that rolled off as Bob indicated. And we do have some coming in the future. So its very difficult to say not exactly sure what\u2019s happening in Del Webb collectively other than that, it continues to be a good performer we just didn\u2019t particularly see the outsized performance this quarter. Robert O'Shaughnessy: And the pricing there is still strong, the margin generation and the ASPs that we are getting from that buyer group were \u2013 they are still healthy and if and when they start to buy more actively it would really be beneficial. Richard J. Dugas: One other comment there Buck, in talking to some of the operators in some of our strong Del Webb committees we do limit lot sales quite a bit. We don\u2019t want to get too far out of our ability to produce and protect our ability to drive price forward and there is a number of communities where we had excellent performance that were holding the lines. So a little bit of this is self induced, just to ensure that we don\u2019t get say a backlog that\u2019s out of year as an example versus say six or seven months. Buck Horne : All right, thanks. And I wanted to follow-up on Nishu\u2019s question a little bit on the SG&A because anyway we were getting with this question about your variable cost is on commission should be increasing as you have more closings in the back half of the year. The component you said about your community openings you are certainly planning on continue to open a few number of communities later this year. So I am trying to understand is implicitly are you forecasting that \u2013 the people cost you described are actually going down in the back half of the year to hit to that 160 to 165 number or people cost\u2026 Robert O'Shaughnessy: Buck you have to remember we actually run our commissions through margins. So cost of goods sold, so that\u2019s not a variable from SG&A. Richard J. Dugas: So I think that's the difference between what you're asking. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Kenneth R. Zener: Good morning gentlemen. Richard J. Dugas: Hi, Ken. Kenneth R. Zener: Looking at gross margin the interest that you are capitalizing is out about 80 bps year-over-year. And I am just wondering if you could give us kind of a view on structural elements in gross margin that you know about, so you are going to be doing about 23 gross margin this year, you know there is a tailwind of in 1Qs case 80 basis points from interest expenses is that what you would expected to be for the year. And then could you maybe talk about other factors that, that\u2019s tailwind, could you kind of highlight with some of these factors are that you are kind of seeing or thinking about I mean are you saving more in commissions or commissions cost any more, is land, does that change as well as given the 1Q prices. Are you going to \u2013 I am sorry if I missed it but did you give a fiscal year ASP or year end ASP that you would be willing to guide us towards. Thank you very much. Richard J. Dugas: Yes, Ken, we did not give any total year or forward looking ASP number, we are going to continue to get the interest benefit through the year with regard to margin and then you know all the other components collectively obviously add up to that 23 number, so component of price or component of cost et cetera, I don\u2019t know Bob do you have any more granularity that you want to share. Robert O'Shaughnessy: No, you know we don\u2019t give quarterly views on the interest but we talked about the fact that we\u2019d have 40 or 50 plus million dollar benefit this year in expense versus last year. And so you will see that come to the income statement and will vary by closings on a quarterly basis. Kenneth R. Zener: I mean I guess one question I have and then a follow-up as you move towards the common plan which I think you guys have obviously highlighted a lot of the benefits there part of that being cost, is there a way that you could kind of quantify how much the adult is benefiting you guys in terms of vertical costs or something? Richard J. Dugas: Ken, this is Richard, there is so many moving parts there mix between costs between price, between all of those components, it\u2019s difficult to give an exact number. I\u2019ll just leave it with this, we are very, very pleased with our margin performance, we are at or near the top of the industry and we are very confident in our margin trajectory from here. I terms of exactly which components are driving the March performance it\u2019s up to put a hand alone given the quarter-to-quarter variability. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Jim Krapfel from Morningstar. Your line is open. James Krapfel : Hi, good morning thanks for taking the question. As you mentioned challenging entitlement from early part of your remarks I am just curious to hear which markers are you seen us mostly, what you think the underlying drivers are for the more challenging entailment process and then what you expect, the course of this trend say over the next several years. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Jim entitlements are incredibly difficult in every market, they tend to be a lot tougher on the cost and they are saying Texas as an example which is an easier entitlement market but the trend continues to elongate across the country and that\u2019s likely to continue. It\u2019s simply a combination of lack of folks at the municipality that are available to approve both zonings if you will as well as land development approvals along with the fact that municipalities in general are being conscious of smart growth and the hit rate for entitlement for new communities continues to be very, very challenging. This is not a new story this is something that I think the industry has talked about a lot we\u2019ve talked about a lot, so again it\u2019s having some impact on our ability to get our communities open and get our land spent on time. So it\u2019s more of a transition problem in terms of timing and it is a big picture issue but I doubt the entitlement market ever gets better candidly. James Krapfel : Thanks for that. And then second question, what were the commonly managed plans as a percent of closings this quarter, do you still expect that to get to 70% and if you could get all ballpark how much incremental margin you could get remaining from getting to more commonly managed plans holding other factors constant? Robert O'Shaughnessy: We delivered 54% of our closings through commonly managed plans in the quarter and we feel very good about our ability to get to 70% in a timely that we indicated over the next 18 to 24 months. End of Q& A Operator : We have no further questions in the queue. I like to turn our call back over to our representer. James P. Zeumer: Thanks Ryan. Thanks everybody for your time this morning. We will be available for the remainder of the day if you any follow up questions, otherwise we will look forward to speaking with you on the next call.

My name is Steve, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup, Inc. second quarter 2015 financial results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question and answer session. Thank you. Mr. James Zeumer, you may begin your conference. James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications : Great, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone participating today. I want to welcome you to PulteGroup's conference call to discuss our second quarter financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Joining me for today's call are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President, CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompany today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We will also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later today. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all the participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings including our annual reports and quarterly reports. That said, let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. For those of you who have been following PulteGroup for the past few years, you have repeatedly heard us use terms such as balance, discipline and return-driven, which are all supportive of the value creation strategy we have been pursuing since 2011. Consistent with this focus, let me highlight a few numbers. We have purposefully increased our land spend over the past 24-plus months, allowing us to grow our community county and land pipeline over the period, while actually owning fewer lots, but controlling more positions via options. We remain disciplined in our pursuit of land. Yet, our land acquisition and development spend for the first six months grew by 30% or roughly $200 million over the prior year. The increased investments we make now are intended to support an expanded business in the future. We've focused on investing in superior land positions, which, coupled with the slow, but steady housing recovery, helped drive an 11% increase in our second quarter order value, our highest quarterly value in eight years. We have also been consistent in our emphasis on maximizing margin opportunity on the homes we sell as demonstrated by our second quarter gross margin of 23.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from the first quarter. Our gross margins continue to rank among the highest in the industry, which is a dramatic improvement from just a few years ago. And finally, we paid down $238 million of debt in the second quarter, while also returning almost $0.25 billion to shareholders through dividends and stepped up share repurchase activity in the quarter. I know we have made this point before, but in the past, we likely would have driven every dollar back into new land even if it meant reaching for deals or potentially taking on additional risk. Under today's more disciplined approach, we look first to invest appropriately in the business and then to return excess funds to our shareholders. When we started our value creation journey in 2011, we talked a lot about being more disciplined in how we ran the business and including share repurchases and in increasing dividend in our allocation of capital. We also talked about the need to focus on key operating and financial metrics such as gross margin, overhead leverage, inventory turns and return on invested capital. I'm very pleased to say that the numbers I highlighted and others that Bob will discuss shortly demonstrate the ongoing success of our efforts and that we remain clearly on track with our value creation strategy. The final numbers I want to highlight relate to our backlog which, at almost 9,000 homes, valued at $3.1 billion is our highest in the past eight years. Such a large pipeline of sold homes affords us a lot of production visibility and stability as we look to the second half of 2015. Picking up on comments that I made in our last earnings call, broadly speaking, I would say the improvement in housing demand that we noted in the fourth quarter of 2014 continued through the entire spring selling season of 2015. Our experience aligns with government data, that while always subject to revision, shows that new home sales on a non-seasonally adjusted basis are up every month of 2015 over the comparable prior-year period. While dynamics ranging from potential Federal Reserve actions to uncertainty around global events are helping to create significant volatility in the financial markets, the key underpinnings of a housing recovery remained very supportive of future strength. First, the U.S. economy continues to expand at a modest rate, enabling the country to generate in excess of 200,000 jobs per month, without triggering inflation fears. Second, interest rates are still historically low. And while they have started to move higher, they are still very supportive of homebuying, especially as compared to ever-increasing rental rates, and finally, demographics are aligned to support sustained housing demand with the large boomer population at one end and the even larger millennial segment at the other. Recent data suggests that millennials are getting more active in the market. According to the National Association of Realtors, the percentage of first-time buyers rose to 30% in June. In contrast, a year ago, first-time represented 28% of all buyers. While still below the 40% to 45% expected in a typical recovery, first-time demand is showing more consistent signs of improvement. Overall, we continue to see positive market trends and believe we are still in the early stages to mid stages of a sustained recovery in U.S. housing. In addition, we believe PulteGroup is extremely well positioned to capitalize on the market conditions. Our goals remain consistent : to deliver exceptional operating and financial results, return funds routinely and systematically to shareholders, and to deliver an unmatched experience to our homebuyers. Now let me turn over the call to the Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Bob? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Richard, and good morning. PulteGroup's homebuilding revenue for the second quarter totaled $1.2 billion, which is comparable with prior-year results. Second quarter revenues reflect a 1% or $3,800 increase in average selling price to $332,000, which was essentially offset by a 1% decrease in closings to 3,744 homes. The 1% increase in average selling price for the quarter was driven by a 6% increase in our average Centex prices to $214,000, along with a 2% increase in Del Webb to $332,000. The average selling price for our Pulte brand was down 1% to $391,000. The decrease of second quarter ASP for Pulte primarily reflects a mix shift driven in part by last year's acquisition of certain homebuilding assets of Dominion Homes in Columbus and Louisville. In the second quarter, the closing percentages by brand were as follows : 24% were Centex, 48% were Pulte and 28% were Del Webb. This compares with 23%, 45% and 32% respectively in the second quarter of last year. As we've discussed over the past few years, two-thirds or more of our land investment has been going towards Pulte communities because that's where we're seeing the best returns on invested capital. The overweighting into Pulte communities continues to drive a shift in the mix of the homes we're delivering. Gross margin for our second quarter was 23.3%, which is a sequential increase of 60 basis points from Q1 of this year and is down 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2014. Allowing for typical quarter-to-quarter variability, we expect our third quarter and fourth quarter gross margins to be comparable to the 23.3% delivered in Q2. Based on these expectations, we anticipate that our full-year gross margin will exceed our previous guidance of 23%. The Q2 trends and option revenues and lot premiums were comparable to what we experienced in Q1 of this year. For the second quarter, option revenues per closing increased 9% or $4,400 over last year, while lot premiums gained 5% or $600. Sales discounts this quarter totaled 2.2% per home, which is up about 50 basis points from last year, but consistent with our preceding two quarters. As a result of changes to certain accounting estimates recorded in the second quarter of 2015 and 2014, SG&A for the periods was not directly comparable. Reported SG&A in the second quarter of 2015 was $130 million or 10.5% of home sale revenues. SG&A in Q2 2015 included a $27 million benefit resulting from a legal settlement. Excluding the impact of this settlement, SG&A was consistent with our guidance for quarterly expenditures in the range of $160 million to $165 million. Reported SG&A in the second quarter of last year was $230 million, which included $88 million in charges for insurance reserves and office relocation costs. Financial services second quarter pre-tax income was $10 million, up slightly from $9 million in the prior year. Our mortgage capture rate for the quarter increased to 83%, up from 80% last year. Closing out a review of the income statement, the effective tax rate was 38%, which is consistent with our previous guidance, resulting in second quarter net income of $103 million, or $0.28 per share. EPS for the quarter was calculated on approximately 364 million shares outstanding, which is down 4% from last year, resulting largely from share repurchase activities. Moving onto our homebuilding operations. At the end of the second quarter, the company had 6,779 homes under construction, of which 17% were spec. Our finished spec inventory at quarter end was only 314 homes, which remains well below one finished spec per community. We continue to emphasize a build-to-order model for our operations, but we may elect to put a limited number of spec homes into production in certain communities to help reduce seasonality in our projection in the future. While the number of spec units involved will be modest, we believe a more even production cadence has the potential to yield construction efficiencies and can help reduce some of the volatility in quarter-to-quarter closing volumes. On the land side, we approved approximately 4,800 lots for purchase and ended Q2 with 136,000 lots under control. In total, 40,000, or 30% of our lot position are controlled through options, which compares to 10% at the end of 2010 when we launched our value creation initiatives and reflects the progress we've made in our efforts to manage our land risks and drive higher returns on invested capital. Of our controlled lots, approximately 23% are developed. In the second quarter, we spent $444 million on land and related development, of which 58% was for development of existing positions and 42% for was acquisition. For the first six months of this year, our total land spend was $929 million. We're anticipating that our land investment activities will accelerate in the second half of 2015, although we are likely to slightly under-spend the $2.4 billion full-year authorization we noted at the beginning of the year. A competitive land market, development delays and longer entitlement timelines on a number of projects means some deals have slipped and some may have been postponed or delayed indefinitely. As we've said previously, we won't force investment into the system. While our $2.4 billion authorization remains in place, we now expect that our 2015 land investments will be closer to $2.3 billion. This would represent an increase of almost 30% over last year's land spend and is consistent with our view that the housing recovery will continue for at least several more years. In addition to investing in the business during the quarter, we also repurchased 10.7 million shares of PulteGroup stock for $213 million, or $19.90 per share. This level of activity has roughly doubled recent quarters and is consistent with our commitment to the return of capital to our shareholders. We also used available capital to retire $238 million of senior notes that matured in the second quarter. Given the reduction in both our debt and equity positions, we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 26% and a cash position of $478 million. Second quarter sign-ups totaled 5,118 homes, an increase of 7% over the prior year. As Richard noted in his comments, on a dollar basis, sign-ups increased 11% to $1.8 billion, our highest quarterly value in eight years. By brand, unit sign-ups increased 27% at Pulte and decreased 13% and 7% at Centex and Del Webb, respectively. Adjusting for community count, absorption paces increased 6% at Pulte and 4% at Del Webb, while declining 7% at Centex. Lower reported Centex paces were driven in part by acquired communities in Columbus and Louisville, which are still transitioning to new products and processes. During the second quarter, we operated from 630 communities, which is up 7% from the comparable prior-year period. Plans still call for us to open approximately 200 new communities during 2015. Depending upon the ultimate timing of community openings and closings, we expect to operate from approximately 610 to 625 communities in both Q3 and Q4. And finally, we ended Q2 with a backlog of 8,998 homes valued at $3.1 billion, which is up from 8,179 homes valued at $2.8 billion last year. Now, let me turn the call back to Richard. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Bob. You just heard Bob provide a breakdown of our business by brand, but we have had discussions internally about whether this data provides a complete picture of our homebuilding business. Why do we say this? As we have talked about on our prior calls, in 2014, we undertook a comprehensive study of active adult consumers. Then, this year, we launched a comparable study of first-time homebuyers to identify underserved market opportunities. Last year's research has already led to our developing smaller, active adult communities. And while the first-time buyers study is still wrapping up, it shows distinct differences across the spectrum of first-time buyers, from traditional entry-level to millennials. While externally, we discuss buyer activity along brand lines for the sake of simplicity, investors who have followed PulteGroup for a while know that we actually design communities to serve 11 targeted consumer groups or TCGs. From the community location and lot layout to the specific floor plans and options we offer, we develop each community to address distinct buyer wants and needs. Our TCG process and brands usually align, but not always. For example, some of our newer, smaller active adult communities are marketed under the Pulte Homes brand to differentiate them from large, highly amenitized Del Webb offerings that may also be in the market. At the same time, within our array of communities are those developed to serve a subset of first-time buyers who prioritize proximity to downtown over schools and single-family design. Based on experience and consistent with this year's market research work, the buyers for these communities are very much today's millennials who are moving out of shared living arrangements and into their first homes. While geared to first-time homebuyers, these communities typically sell under a Pulte Homes brand. The active adult communities under the Pulte brand are just ramping up in number, but communities serving first-time millennial buyers under the Pulte brand accounted for roughly 10% of our communities and 500 sign-ups in the second quarter. And based on our project pipeline, our investment is growing consistent with increased first-time buyer demand. On future calls, we'll look for ways to efficiently bridge the gaps between our brand information and the more fundamental TCG data to provide clearer insights into our consumer-focused approach to the market. Before we open the call to questions, let me close out my comments with a quick overview of market conditions. Consistent with comments made earlier in this call, overall demand in the second quarter was solid, with strong buyer traffic to our communities and sign-up gains in both units and dollars. Generally, demand trends at the market level have remained fairly constant over the past several quarters. At a high level, conditions in the quarter were as follows : Starting on the East Coast, we experienced strong demand pretty much across the board from Massachusetts to Florida. As we have highlighted in the past, Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas continue to demonstrate notable strength. We have also seen improvements further up the coast, particularly in the Northeast. Working our way toward the central third of the country, the Midwest generally experienced a favorable demand environment although we saw volatility between markets and periods. I'd like to make a comment about our Columbus and Kentucky markets which we entered last year through the purchase of certain Dominion assets. The team there has done a great job repositioning select communities and building the business, while getting integrated into our systems and adopting our common plan processes and related strategic pricing programs. Both markets are very healthy and we are pleased to have a business presence there. Dropping down into Texas, demand softness at higher price points in Houston, which we have commented on previously, is being exacerbated by shortfalls in lot availability in certain communities across the state, resulting from rain-induced development delays. Traffic to our communities across the Texas markets indicate that buyer interest remains high, but consumers have more products from which to choose as additional supplies in the market. Demand conditions out west remained strong from Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico and into California. If there is a market or sub-market where we experience any softness in sales, the issue is more likely product availability than buyer interest. We are certainly encouraged by the demand conditions we saw in the quarter and over the spring selling season. I will say, however, that market, sub-market and community locations matter, with better closer-in positions generally still faring better in the quarter and through the first few weeks of July. From PulteGroup's perspective, we would say the spring selling season was a successful one for the company and one that leaves us well positioned for the coming quarters. We experienced strong sign-ups allowing us to end the quarter with a backlog of almost 9,000 homes, our highest backlog in years. At the same time, we have a robust land pipeline that we continue to expand through our disciplined investment process, and our operations continue to deliver superior gross margins with the potential for significant overhead leverage as delivery volumes climb in the last two quarters of the year. Finally, we maintain what might be the strongest balance sheet and financial position in the industry. We view the flexibility this provides us as an important competitive advantage as we continue to move through the housing cycle. The strength of our market and financial positions are a direct reflection of the hard work of our 4,000 employees. And I want to recognize and thank them for their efforts. Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications : Thank you, Richard. We'll now open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourselves to one question and to one follow-up. Steve, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Hey, guys, good morning. Nice quarter and congrats on the buyback activity. I think that's going to be well received. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Alan, Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: First question on the backlog conversion and the closings. I think last quarter, you highlighted that you really expect to see most of the catch-up from the weather issues, more 3Q, 4Q. Was hoping you could just give us an update there on how you think closings are going to play out over the course of the remainder of the year. And with the new spec strategy or I guess a little bit higher spec total, is that something that we should kind of factor in to closing and order estimates for this year or is that more in anticipation of the 2016 selling season? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Alan, it's Richard. A couple of things, we really don't use conversion rate as something that we track a lot internally. But weather in the second quarter did impact our delivery schedule. And I would just say this, with regard to the balance of the year, we expect that conversion rates to trend back towards historical norms through Q3 and Q4. Relative to the spec comments Bob made, one thought there, we are not dramatically changing our spec position, but we are going to introduce selected spec deliveries to help even out production cadence. And that's more of a 2016 impact than anything you could expect this year. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it, thank you. And then one follow-up. On the pricing environment, you mentioned margins should be pretty flat with 2Q. Was curious what you're seeing on the pricing side. Is pricing power accelerating in any of your markets? And if so, how do you think about the margin outlook maybe beyond the next couple of quarters? Do you feel like the bias is more to the upside from current levels or are you still striving for maintaining a current kind of 23% level on a go-forward basis? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, first of all, this is Richard again. I'll say that we're pleased with our margin trajectory. And we're happy with the guidance that we provided, which is up slightly from what we said before. From a pricing perspective, I think we believe there is more upside than downside to pricing. We're going to have watch what happens with the economy and with rates overall. But we wouldn't want to provide, Alan, any commentary beyond the guidance that Bob gave. So nothing really at this point for 2016, our backlog visibility isn't quite that far yet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, thanks very much, guys. Good results. Let me ask you a question if I could about the orders. I think you mentioned about Centex down 7%. You were talking about some acquisition-related effects. Can you just give a little more granularity about that? What you meant by that and sort of what we're seeing on the ground which is driving that negative impact? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Stephen, this is Bob. What we were highlighting was that the cases out of the Columbus and Kentucky are slower. So if you had excluded that, for instance, from our Centex results, our Centex paces would have been flat quarter-over-quarter. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it, okay. That's great. The second question relates to a comment \u2013 or I think a thread of conversation that you and I had a month or so ago where you were talking about some consumer research I think that you were conducting regarding the entry level. And I think one of the takeaways was that you were starting to see that millennials or entry-level buyers are willing to trade size for proximity. So, they're not willing to drive till they qualify kind of thing. They kind of want to live closer to the job centers and were willing to take a smaller footprint home to do that. I wanted to follow up with you, see whether or not that is in fact what your research has concluded. And if so, do you have any availability in your existing communities or ones that you sort of teed up here over the next year or two to sort of accommodate maybe some smaller, more entry-level product into existing land positions, because that would seem to suggest you'd have to sort of rezone them, or not? If you could just sort of talk about the research and the conclusion \u2013 how you would deal with the conclusions in your \u2013 on the ground. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Stephen, it's Bob again. We have not concluded that research. We're making progress and so certainly before the end of this year. But for everybody's benefit, essentially what it would suggest is that there is a group of first-time buyers in that millennial age group that \u2013 and you said it will \u2013 are willing to trade size for proximity. And I think it's essentially what Richard talked about in his prepared remarks about that millennial buyer. And what it was trying to tell you was that it is already a pretty significant part of our portfolio of, again, not entry-level, but first-time buyers in that millennial age group. And so, we do have communities open today. Certainly, you've heard us talk about three quarters of our spend is Pulte-branded \u2013 it includes that buyer group. So yeah, we are actively serving them today. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And Stephen, Richard with a little additional commentary. That's what we call our TCG3 category, which is part of that first-time buyer group that serve under the Pulte brand, and that was sort of a clarification we were providing at the end. In addition to it being a big piece, as Bob indicated, we also indicated in our prepared remarks it's a growing piece. And then lastly, we would not anticipate being able to rezone existing communities to take advantage of it, but that's not to discount the ramp up in investment activity geared toward that category, which will play out over the coming years. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Good morning, Richard. You'd mentioned \u2013 made two comments during your prepared remarks that I thought were interesting. One, you talked about investing appropriately as you move forward, and the other, better located, still performing well. Could you talk some about what that means to you, investing appropriately as you go through this cycle? And maybe you can put it in content versus this year. I don't know whatever works best, but then also the better located, still performing well in through July and all that, talk a little bit about what that means, better located, if you will. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, Stephen, good morning. I would say from an investing appropriately standpoint, what we really mean by that is tied to our disciplined philosophy, where number one, we invest in the business and our land positions. And then the other investment choices come after that, including on increasing dividend, selective M&A and then residual cash being used for routine systematic buyback purchases. And I think you saw us execute against all of those this quarter. So we view that as very consistent. And to put a little more granularity in it, we're very proud of the fact that we stuck to the appropriate investment philosophy, which leads to your second comment around better locations. What we're really trying to say there is, that's one of the reasons our margins are holding up well. We continue to believe we're buying the best dirt out there. We're not reaching for things. Overall, our land trajectory, our spend trajectory has been up; so we would expect a bigger business in the future and that's why we continued to invest where we are, while keeping all the other parameters in check, so hope that helps. Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI : It does. Thanks. And then sort of along those lines, your orders grew pretty much in line with your community count. I know you focused a lot more on margins over the last three years and have not been as focused on the absorption pace, if you will. As you look out, call it, over the next four quarters, six quarters, whatever timeframe you're comfortable putting on it, how do you view that dynamic? Are you at a point in the cycle where you think your absorption should be greater or you still are \u2013 that's just secondary to what you're doing on the gross profit line? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Stephen, our overall goal, we've said it repeatedly, is return on invested capital. And the blend between pace and price is a tricky one in every single community, and frankly, it depends on the community overall. I would be hard pressed to say whether we had more opportunity in margin or pace going forward. But I will tell you this, we've made a lot of progress on margin over the past few years. We haven't provided any guidance sort of beyond that, but we're looking to balance both. And for us, everything from compensation to the way we talk about the business is really ROIC. We've emphasized margins a lot these past few years because our margins needed a lot of improvement overall. And at this stage, we're really talking about returns. So I apologize for not being able to give you more specificity there, but that's the way we're looking at it. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark (sic) [Mike] Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and the helpful color here. Wanted to just ask a question, maybe a little more granularly on the margin guidance because it seems like if you're holding these levels for the next couple quarters, it nets out to like slightly above 23%. And the previous guide was approximately, so are we talking was the previous guide really like a 22.8% and now it's a 23.2%? Or just any sense of magnitude on just really what the increase is. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Mike, it's Bob. We have, just trying to clarify, we have been speaking to 23% certainly in the last quarter since we delivered in excess of that and have suggested that we'll continue to. And with the seasonality of the business, the production being more geared towards the back half of the year, we would blend to a higher rate than 23% and just wanted to point that out. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Okay. And then shifting to some of the color around Texas, obviously some challenging conditions as you noted with the weather. But were some of those comments also around just being the high end pricing issues being exacerbated by shortages, but then there was also a comment about more competition. Was that also still isolated at the high end or was that a broader issue that you're seeing on the market \u2013 on the ground in Houston? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, Mike, this is Richard. Rain throughout Texas hampered results across the state for the quarter, particular with regard to production. The comment we made regarding the high end was specific to Houston, but the comment we made regarding a little bit more inventory in the market is statewide. So our overall view on Texas, we like Texas. We like the market environment. It's a little more competitive than it was. We're trying to say it as matter-of-factly as we can. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning, and congrats on a very nice quarter. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Bob. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I've got a lot of very positive feedback on your share buyback activity. And just, I think, speaking to some of Richard's comments about land prices being inflated. If you don't find what you need in terms of land supply to your expectations, what is the priority for that excess cash? Does it go to share buybacks or what do you want to do with it? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Bob, this is Bob. I think the answer is we look at that every year. Certainly, we have been more active in the share repurchase arena, that's largely not a call on the equity, it's actually just capital structuring; we're below our targeted range of 30% to 40%, leverage at 26%, so we feel we have significant capacity to do that. But again, first and foremost, we want to invest in the business. You can see that in the investment levels. Going forward, we'll look at that with a forward view as based on our best estimates of what the business can do. Certainly, you heard Richard talk about the priority is investing in the business, paying an increasing dividend. So we look at dividends. M&A activity, if it's out there, we would opportunistically look at, and then the rest would be share repurchases. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. So my other question is just on that theme of reinvesting back into the business. Today, when you're looking at the incremental dollar spend that you're going to put in, which of your three brands is most likely to get that dollar? And geographically, where are you trying to invest the most? Thanks and good luck. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Bob. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Bob. Richard here. Thus far in housing recovery, and we've been pretty consistent in this, we've been putting most of our dollars into the Pulte brand to serve that move-up category. I would say there is an increasing focus on the entry-level for us, and again, we're trying to highlight in our commentary that we've been actually putting quite a bit of capital toward the first-time buyer, that millennial category, to serve that growing category. And we'll have more to say about that in the future as our study continues. And then I'd say some selective Del Webb investments in smaller positions across the system. So, overall I'd say Pulte is the priority and then probably the other two categories with a fairly balanced approach, but always trying to seek the highest return; so it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. And your line is open. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question just on the segments, you kind of mentioned that the Pulte brand, in a sense, is bleeding into the other, if I could use that term, bleeding into the other categories in terms of serving some of the Del Webb demand as well as perhaps some of the entry-level or millennial demand. And I'm just curious when you think about, if you were to report ASPs and particularly closings is what I'm getting at, not by the brand, but by broader, let's say, entry-level move-up, entry-level/move-up for Centex, active adult instead of Del Webb, which would include perhaps some of that Pulte-branded offerings. At this point, would the Centex and Del Webb percentages be up by a couple percent? And given the morphing or brand extension of Pulte, is this perhaps how you might report the segments from a demographic perspective going forward? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so, sorry, I hate to be technical. Our segments are geographic, Mike. We present this information for simplicity when we're talking to Wall Street. But I think the answer is, and what Richard highlighted, we are seeing a future pipeline of that active adult that's Pulte-branded. We have an existing book of business that is first-time buyer that is Pulte-branded. And he highlighted the amount of that. And so, I think what it would show you, if you looked at it in the way that you just asked, that entry-level first-time buyer group would be bigger than our Centex brand. You wouldn't see much of a change out of Pulte into the active adult, so that wouldn't change much. So I think what we're looking at is how to make that information digestible without confusing people with too much data. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right, right. Yeah, no, I think that kind of the continuation of thinking about that would certainly be helpful and maybe, again, broadening the \u2013 instead of Centex, Del Webb, maybe just broadening the definition, so to speak. Secondly, you mentioned Texas and also California in your regional review. I was hoping to get a little bit more, if possible, market-by-market review of California, how the different markets are going. As well as when you talk about Texas being slightly more competitive, is that just in the form of perhaps discounts coming up a little bit by percentage or two, or if you're seeing any price reductions? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Mike, it's Richard. With regard to California, what we're seeing is the better located assets are doing extremely well. Some of the outer-lying positions not quite as well, but where you have very, very well-located communities, we're seeing a lot of strength. With regard to Texas, overall, the Dallas market is the strongest of the markets, but our commentary overall is not really related to discounts. It's just a little bit more inventory in the market across the state. Not a dramatic shift, but something that we've noticed over the past couple of quarters overall, so again, still a good housing market. One that we're pleased to be in, but a little more competitive than it was. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath with MKM Partners. Your line is open. Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC : Good morning. So I wanted to ask \u2013 I think you mentioned either in your slides or your press release about an increase in the amount of land that's optioned. Was that a change over the last couple of quarters? Are you seeing any kind of change in increase in options available or could you maybe give more detail on what's going on there? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Megan, it's Bob. We have been seeking to do more option transactions and I would say it goes back over years, not quarters. You've seen a gradual increase, I think, in the data we've presented. It showed 10%, up to now 30%. And the answer is, to your second question, is it more available? Really not. So, what we're seeing is a lot more raw transaction. So historically, it was a healthier developer base in the country. You might have seen more opportunity to do finished lot option takedowns. What we're really talking about is, if there's a position and I'll make up a fact pattern that has 600 lots in it, and we've got a current need for 200 of them, of medium-term need for 200 more and then a longer-term need for 200 more, what we're trying to do is structure transactions that would allow us to take the first third, control the second third and third third over time. But we would be the developer typically, and so it comes down to a parcel-by-parcel negotiation. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Megan, Richard here. One of the reasons we highlighted it is just when you look at it over the few years, as Bob indicated, it's a pretty dramatic improvement and very consistent with our overall focus on a much more balanced approach with regard to capital. So in addition to the priorities for capital, even within the land priority, we're very proud of the fact that we're controlling a lot more lots while not taking here as much risk as we have in the past. Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC : Great, thanks. And then just a little more clarification on the first-time buyer discussion. I think you're trying to answer this, but let me just clarify. You mentioned in your initial comments that there is evidence in the market that the first-time buyer is coming back. You mentioned statistics from the NAR and you also mentioned that the new stuff \u2013 that your Centex was flat, so are you saying that you are actually seeing it, it's just in these Pulte-branded communities? Or are you saying there's some evidence, but you're not actually seeing it yet in your order growth? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Actually, Megan, if you go back over the last year or two, we've had pretty strong comps in terms of the Centex brand and not just in Texas. We've highlighted other parts of the country, but Texas is a big part of our Centex business. So I think we've seen, although flat absorptions this quarter, ex-Louisville and Columbus, we've seen pretty good results over time. And to your question in terms of what's in the Pulte brand, I don't have the data right now to tell you what that first-time buyer component that we've flagged Pulte is. But obviously, the Pulte same-store comps were up 6%, so you can certainly conclude that it was a portion of that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG. Your line is open. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi, good morning. Another question on the first-time buyer and how it relates to the Pulte brand expansion. What I think I'm hearing is the strategy on the first-time for Pulte is, hey, look, we're going to keep focusing on that higher income, first-time buyer, maybe the larger house in part to preserve margin, more so than a lower margin, lesser location Centex-type product. Is that a fair interpretation of where we're at on the first-time strategy? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Jack, I don't think it's either, candidly. What we're trying to highlight is that under the Pulte brand, as I think everyone's aware, we have been serving this millennial buyer. And sort of the traditional view of an entry-level consumer buying a home in their mid-20s and then trading up, et cetera, over time is changing. And in fact we're seeing a lot of people actually skip the Centex true entry-level product, say at $200,000, and buy a Pulte-branded home at $300,000 in their early-to-mid-30s, typically consistent with when they either get married or begin living together, and their housing needs change from rental to ownership. We have been doing quite a bit of that business with the Pulte brand. And it's in an urban sort of infill location, it's clearly targeted to that upwardly mobile millennial buyer. And as we started peeling through the data in response to lots of questions from investors, we wanted to just provide a little bit more clarity that that was a significant portion of our business. And we were not ignoring the growing interest in what's happening with the millennial category overall. So we've been doing a lot of that business through the Pulte brand with townhome product, a little bit of condominium product, and it's not an insignificant amount of our business, as we indicated, about 500 closings in the recent quarter. So, we're simply just trying to introduce this concept that our brand strategy was not always perfectly consistent with first-time move-up and active adult. And going forward, we're looking for ways to clarify that a little bit more. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay, thank you. And then I think Richard, in your prepared comments, you had mentioned that land was heating up. Any way you can give us sort of a magnitude of rate of change. And then curious if the step-up in buyback is in any way related to that higher \u2013 a higher, more expensive land picture that you mentioned? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'll start and then Bob may want to add something here, Jack. First of all, the land environment has been competitive for the last several quarters. And we haven't noted anything unique this particular quarter overall. And as it relates to our buyback activity, starting last fall, we told investors very clearly that we had a priority for investment, first in land, second increasing dividend, third, opportunistic M&A, and then fourth, residual cash for systemic and routine buybacks, and we've been executing exactly against that. As Bob indicated, our leverage is a little bit lower than we like it. We had free cash flow. And I think we're extremely pleased with the flexibility we have. It's not an either-or for us. So we were able to step up our land purchases fairly significantly in the range of the guidance we provided, while still paying down debt and repurchasing shares at a higher rate than we had. So it wasn't particularly related to a spike in land prices this quarter, but more of an execution on our strategy that we think over time provides the best returns for our shareholders. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Jack. The only thing I'd add to that on the land piece is it's important to remember, and you heard Richard talking about, that we are seeking better located assets, and the reality is those are always competitive. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Will Randow with Citigroup. Your line is open. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning, and congrats on the quarter. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Will. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Will. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): In terms of your two years of developed supply, is that skewed towards controlled? I won't expect it to. And do you think that's enough developed lot supply if we see demand pick up incrementally? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm not sure I understand the question, Will. You say it is our two-year supply? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Maybe you could repeat it, Will, if you don't mind. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Sure, sure, sorry about that. Your two years of developed lots in terms of supply. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Do you think that's skewed \u2013 is that skewed towards controlled in any way? And do you feel like that's enough lot supply if we were to see demand pick up? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think the answer is, it's going to be market-by-market. There are certain markets where we have ample supply of lots in front of us. There are others where we're working through and developing lots as we go. I think we've got 27% of our lots are finished/owned, 26% are under development. So we feel pretty good, but you heard Richard talk about in Texas when we get weather, it can slow you down, so it's always a work-in-process. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for that. And in terms of the, as a follow-up, the $27 million legal settlement, do you expect any further reoccurrence of that? And what is the cash flow hit from that? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, actually, this is a reversal of an accrual, so it means we won't spend the cash. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And it's really just another step in the process of settling construction issues, one that had been working its way through the courts for a number of years. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with UBS. Your line is open. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Susan. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Your Centex ASP rose 6% during the quarter despite some of the sort of issues around the acquisitions and things in that segment. Can you just talk a little bit about what drove that and how we should be thinking about it going forward? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Susan, it's actually a mix issue. It's because of the production issues in Texas, which has our lowest Centex-priced product, so the mix is just different. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then looking long, bigger picture, with the potential rise in rate that's coming this year, are you hearing from any of your buyers that that's factoring into their decision process yet? Or maybe how that will eventually factor into their thoughts and getting them maybe to pull the trigger and make that purchase decision? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Susan, it's Richard. I would say it's a little early yet for that to have played out. Rates just did begin rising here over the last month to six weeks primarily. Historically, I would say that does drive purchase behavior as people kind of fear the loss of a low rate environment. So we certainly don't fear that occurring, provided that it continues with the economy continuing to strengthen. But are we hearing a lot of anecdotal information on the ground about that? I'd say not yet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne with Raymond James. Your line is open. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, thanks guys. I'm just trying to interpret some of the comments and maybe read between the lines here. But based on the land investment strategies and the talk about the first-time millennial buyer, which may be acting and behaving differently than previous generations, I'm kind of wondering is there a sense that the core Centex, that entry-level suburban sub-$200,000 price point, is that really going to have a recovery in this cycle? And I'm guessing what are your thoughts about \u2013 do we really need to maintain the Centex land positions at this point or do we \u2013 is there a need to continue reinvesting in that product? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, Buck, this is Richard. We absolutely want to continue reinvesting in that area when returns make sense. And nothing in our commentary would suggest that we don't believe that's an important part of a housing recovery. I would say, however, consistent with what we said in the past, making the returns work for those more suburban, lower-priced product is more challenging still today. And we would expect that as the housing recovery continues that that will get a little bit easier as pace continues to come back into that segment. So that's a little bit disconnected, candidly, from our comments about the millennials. We're simply trying to highlight with regard to the millennials that there's a growing appetite for a fairly affluent, in-town urban buyer that wants this attached product that we have been delivering and will continue to. But with regard to Centex proper, if you will, the kind of traditional entry-level $200,000 price point as an example, that's an important part of the business, particularly in Texas, and particularly some of the southeast markets that we want to continue to invest in. It just hasn't warranted the ramp up in investment that some of the other categories have yet, but we're watching it closely and we candidly expect it to at some point in the housing recovery. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And just because it was brought up earlier in a quick comment, but there was a mention about you'd potentially look at M&A transactions if they would make sense, I guess. I'm wondering what criteria and under what circumstances you guys would think about M&A? Is that mainly looking at other private players or potentially another public-to-public transaction? What was maybe behind that comment or thought process? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Nothing new there. We highlighted that it would be one of the priorities for our utilization of capital. I wouldn't want to speculate as to whether it would be a private or public builder. We would typically look at these as land transactions though. So we use the same basic underwriting criteria for a transaction for a group of assets from a builder as we would for a single community. So it's really a land play for us. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. So, on the interest rate question, we've seen rates rising through most of this year, through, particularly in the second quarter. So, is there anything that you've seen on your month-by-month trends or maybe through your mortgage operation that could give us some sense of whether the rising rate environment has spurred people on or whether it has caused people to back away from purchases? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't know that there's anything that you would be able to know what would've happened if rates had been different. One thing that you can see is that people are locking a little bit earlier. People are not choosing arms. So from the financing perspective, it influences their behavior in terms of how much risk do they want to take coming up to the closing. But I haven't heard any detailed commentary about \u2013 I'm not buying because of interest rates or I bought today because interest rates might go up. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And you've talked a good bit about the weather, you addressed Texas mainly, as I understand it, in your comments so far. So, in the Midwest and the Northeast, there were also some pretty significant rains towards the end of the second quarter particularly in June. You folks obviously have decent-sized operations in those regions. So any effect on those regions either from a demand perspective or from a deferral of closings, construction schedules perspective? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Nishu, it's Richard. I would say what we've seen in the rest of the country, you'd typically see somewhere in the country with regard to weather. So we haven't called it out uniquely. Clearly, weather always plays a factor in production. It's not as big a factor with regard to sales unless it prevents you from opening communities, which the reason we called out Texas this time is it was so unique. It caused some community delays, which impacted our sales environment some, but more importantly, helped to cause the production shortfall that we've seen through the first couple of quarters of the year. So beyond that, nothing that we would note, particularly. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. On the capital structure, wanted to get a sense as to where you think you are today. Is your cash position about where you'd want it to be? And do you feel that you are still under-levered? And what might be the key metrics that we should be thinking about to understand what you view as an optimal capital structure? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, what we've highlighted is that we'd like to have leverage and it sort of hinges off of leverage somewhere between 30% and 40%. We're obviously a little bit below that today. We have just under $500 million of cash at the end of the quarter. We have several hundred million dollars of availability under our credit facility above and beyond that. So, we feel like we have a really strong liquidity position. Obviously, we chose to pay down our debt instead of refinancing it with the maturity in the second quarter. So going forward, I think as we look at it, a lot of it will depend on our expectations for investment in the business, and obviously we reforecast that periodically, coupled with our expectations for cash generation out of the business. And so, in looking at it, I think it's fair to assume we've got a pretty big maturity coming up next year, so we'll be looking at our leverage over the next two quarters, three quarters to figure out what makes sense. We pay attention to capital markets activity all the time to see if there are attractive entry points. So, I think we're very comfortable running with this much cash and even a little bit less, candidly, because we have so much availability under the revolver. And then we think we've got access to the capital markets on terms that what would be attractive. So, when we need to, we have a way to fill any cash shortfalls that we might want to deal with. So, again, leverage being between 30% and 40% is what is driving most of our decision making. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And so is it fair to say \u2013 because I guess you had to make that decision whether to go refinance or not. And I certainly see that you might've decided to, yes, go out and refinance now, and yet, you choose not to. Is that because you want to have a greater degree of line of sight in terms of the investments in land and development opportunities that would have justified putting more debt on that balance sheet? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we feel like we do have pretty good line of sight into our projected spend, certainly over the next six months to 12 months. So what it tells you is we have obviously a business that is cash-accretive. We're not paying cash taxes. We have a lot of production coming in the back half of this year, which will be generating a lot of cash. We're also going to be investing a lot, but we didn't feel any pressure that says, oh, gosh, we should go refinance this debt. So really, it's just an evaluation as time goes on. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless with Sterne, Agee. Your line is open. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask in terms of the ROIC focus. Could you talk about the returns on potentially selling some of the land that you may have earmarked for some of these entry-level and maybe a little more spec-heavy communities? Because it looks like in the first half of this year, you guys have run a land gross margin of about 22%. Last year, I think it was roughly 31%. So, I think there would be a case \u2013 there's a case to be made that you might make more from selling that land, especially with the appreciation you've discussed rather than trying to put maybe some gross margin-dilutive homes out there. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Jay, this is Richard. Several years ago, about three years ago, we undertook a really deep-dive look at every single position in our balance sheet. And we were pretty clear with investors that we did intend to sell a portion of land and we've done most of that. I don't know what the exact numbers are, but somewhere around $300 million of land over the past few quarters have been sold. So it's always a portion of our portfolio, and from time to time, there'll be a position that gets sold. I would say a lot of that heavy lifting is done. It's also hard to predict the timing on it, so we couldn't give you any good projections, but there's not a concerted effort to wipe off a portion of the balance sheet there. We would rather develop that into home sites and capture the margin on the land as well as the home. We've gotten pretty efficient at capturing margin on the home in addition to any built-in land appreciation. So we prefer to capture it that way. And given the fact that our prudence with regard to our capital structure has been what it's been, we're pretty happy about that decision. So I wouldn't look for any big land sales. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : Okay. And then just did want to ask a follow-on on the debt question with the 2016's and 2017's coming due. I mean is it \u2013 could you talk a little bit more about, could you refinance potentially both transactions at one shot? Or do you think you have a better shot at paying it off? Just a little more color on the 2016's and the 2017's? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Don't want to comment on 2016's and 2017's, other than to say we obviously look at them as we think about our leverage. I don't think necessarily it makes sense for us to go and take everything out. We'd probably start to want to build the leverage ladder again. So you'd see us putting different things in place, but not trying to take care of all our current maturities. But, you never know. Time will tell. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey there, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So I guess first question is follow-up on some other comments that you made on spec. I guess specifically, your appetite here for raising spec count levels. As you look across your platform, are there regions today where increasing spec count makes sense? Is it across the board? And how do margins on your spec compare to margins on build-to-order? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, our comments \u2013 this is Richard, Haendel. Our comments on spec are related to help us with regard to managing production cadence overall, and it would be on a very limited amount. We have gotten very, very comfortable and happy with our build-to-order model. So we're not trying to signal any kind of shift in priority. We just want to let you know we may feather in some additional spec in select communities to give us an opportunity to help even out our production cadence. And I would suggest the margin impact of that would be very, very minimal because we're not talking about any significant real change in spec policy. Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got you, appreciate that. And second question is, I guess, another margin-related question. Curious to what extent mix was playing a factor in driving gross margin higher sequentially and whether specific areas were able to contain costs versus the first quarter. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, on a sequential basis, actually, our margins are up across all three of our brands as well as a little bit of a benefit from interest. So no concentrated issue there, just better performance across the entire spectrum. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Gentlemen. James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications : Ken. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Ken. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ken. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I wonder, I have two questions. One, is your success in gross margins, which is adjusted for commissions, industry-leading, is that kind of actually trapping you into a narrower opportunity in terms of how you're looking to invest, perhaps? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ken, this is Richard. I would say absolutely not. We've tried to be as clear as we can that we run the business based on returns. And frankly, whether margins go up from here or go down from here, if we get excellent returns on it, that's the name of the game for us, and our land priorities are not margin-specific. They're return-specific as we look at the 200-plus communities we're going to open this year, it's all based on returns. So, no, I don't think gross margins have trapped us into anything. We're happy with our gross margins, we've done a good job with our gross margins. We're proud of them, but I don't think it limits what we do going forward at all. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good. And I asked that \u2013 I was obviously doing that respectfully because you do have very high gross margins. And I'm thinking about another builder that also focuses on returns, but in that investment process, pursued a lower price point, got a higher absorption. I agree with that approach, but obviously there's a wider view perhaps from investors in terms of interpreting if that's good to have the gross margins go down as they're not as focused, investors, perhaps on the returns on capital. Could you perhaps highlight little concerns or thoughts you've had on how others have enacted that return on capital as it relates to lower gross margins? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think you have to appreciate it in terms of what the company's overall philosophy is. And for us, it's very related to our overall capital approach. And if we were as focused on land investment exclusively as we were five years or 10 years ago, we might have a little bit of a different posture here. But given the fact that we want to be involved in all aspects of capital allocation, which we are very convinced over the housing cycle is going to be the best total shareholder return for shareholders, has dictated our philosophy. So, I wouldn't want to comment on what anyone else is doing. I would just say that we think we're doing a good job quarter-in and quarter-out and balancing it. And over time, we're very confident that it's going to yield the right result. We've learned our lesson in the past of trying to overdo it on the land side, and we're really pleased with our balanced and prudent approach today, so I hope that helps. James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications : Yeah, and just to close that out, Ken, it's Jim, we've talked for a while now about not being so focused on just driving unit volumes or driving volumes for volumes' sake and really being more focused on, to Richard's point, about the returns. And as a consequence, the investments and everything line up accordingly. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Zeumer, I turn the call back over to you. James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications : Great. Thanks, everybody, for your time this morning. We'll certainly be around for the remainder of the day if you've got any additional questions. We'll look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. PulteGroup's third quarter financial results reflect another quarter of strong business performance across key operating metrics, partially offset by the challenging production environment that is impacting us in many housing markets across the country. More specifically, I would highlight our strong sales performance and the increase in absolute signups and absorption paces, both of which moved higher in the quarter. I believe these results attest to the sustained rebound in overall U.S. housing demand and are consistent with our expectations that the recovery path for this housing cycle will be gradual and prolonged. Beyond signups, I would also highlight that our gross margins of 23.6% are up 70 basis points over last year, and up 30 basis points from the second quarter 2015. Pulte's gross margins continue to be among the highest in the whole building industry, which demonstrates the tremendous progress we have made from when we began this journey less than five years ago. I believe that our gains in third quarter signups, absorption paces, and gross margins have all benefited from the quality of the land positions we have been putting under contract over the past few years. As we have talked about on prior calls, we have worked hard to maintain a disciplined approach toward acquiring better located land positions that we believe will generate higher risk adjusted returns. In addition to supporting the idea of better land locations, the strength of our gross margins demonstrates continued success in the implementing our strategic pricing initiatives, and in expanding the use of commonly managed plans. In the third quarter, commonly managed plans accounted for almost 60% of closings, which is up from 45% last year, and keeps us on track to reach our goal of 70% in 2016. Our margins are also benefiting from prior actions to significantly reduce our debt balances, which, in turn, has helped to lower our annual interest expense. Through the first nine months of 2015, interest expense running through the cost of sales is down almost $37 million from last year. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation, including reducing our overall balance sheet leverage these past few years, is clearly having an impact. And finally, I look at our contract backlog, approaching 9,000 homes with a total value of $3.1 billion, up 18% over last year, and note that these are our highest Q3 backlog statistics since 2007. Given the strength of our backlog and a roughly $100 million year-over-year increase in homes under production on the balance sheet, I am encouraged by how well we are positioned for the remainder of the year and heading into 2016. These same backlog stats, however, reflect the struggles that we, and as reported, the broader industry, continue to face getting homes delivered on a consistent schedule, due primarily to constraints across the production system. We talked on prior calls about working to overcome construction bottlenecks that had developed, but these delays are taking longer than expected to correct. The reality is that resource constraints, particularly as it relates to labor, exist across a number of our markets, and are continuing to hinder our progress. With almost 8,000 homes under construction, which is up 1,000 units over this time last year, the houses are clearly in the production pipeline and will ultimately be delivered. We would anticipate that we'll close some of the gap with prior-year production metrics in the fourth quarter, and then work to make additional progress in 2016. The good news is that overall demand for housing continues to be positive. Overall, I see a lot to be proud of within our third quarter results and what they say about our commitment to running this business to deliver earnings growth with higher returns over time. Consistent with our long-term objectives with regard to delivering higher returns, we continue to allocate capital in alignment with our stated priorities : first, to invest in the business, which we did in the form of $586 million of land and development spend in the third quarter; second, to fund an increase in dividend; third, to consider opportunistic M&A and fourth, to return excess funds to shareholders via share repurchases, which we did in the third quarter to the level of $121 million. Our land investment for the quarter keeps us on track with prior guidance of allocating roughly $2.3 billion to land acquisition and development in 2015. We expect this level of investment to be supportive of future volume and, more importantly, earnings growth for the company. This investment level is also consistent with our expectation that U.S. housing demand continues to move higher over the next few years, as an improving economy generates new jobs and ultimately higher wages, and help sustain the recent gains in household formation numbers the country has been experiencing. Against this positive demand environment, we see generally favorable supply dynamics with reasonable inventories of existing homes and a manageable supply of new homes available for sale. If you wanted to find a silver lining in a cloud of tight land and labor resources, it would be that the supply of new homes is not as likely to get ahead of consumer demand as in past cycles. Overall, our expectations remain positive with regard to the broader economy and related macro-housing conditions across the U.S. We see a lot of runway out in front of the new home industry, with particularly bright prospects for PulteGroup, given our strong sales and margin performance, driven, in part, by our disciplined land investments. Now, let me turn over the call to Bob for a more thorough review of the quarter. Bob? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Richard, and good morning. As Richard indicated, there are a lot of positives to be taken from PulteGroup's business results, and how the quarter positions the company for improved performance going forward. Looking at the specifics for the quarter, homebuilding revenue totaled $1.5 billion, which is down 6% from the prior-year. The change in homebuilding revenues was driven by a 6% decline in closings, to 4,356 homes, which was partially offset by a 1% increase in average selling price, to $336,000. Per Richard's comments, home deliveries in Q3 were below our expectations. As we discussed on our most recent call, we expected that our conversion rate would trend toward more recent norms over the back half of this year. Resource constraints, however, particularly related to labor and land development delays triggered by tough weather conditions at the start of the year, hindered our efforts. We remain confident that we will work through this, and with a healthy backlog of sold homes, this is fundamentally a timing issue. We continue to expect to make up some ground in Q4 relative to historical closing metrics, and then we'll work to realize further gains as we get into 2016. In the third quarter, closings by brand were as follows : 23% in Centex communities; 49% in Pulte; and 28% in Del Webb. This compares with closings of 24%, 46%, and 30%, respectively, in the third quarter of last year. On our last call, we talked about targeted consumer groups, or TCGs, being a more granular approach to defining the buyers we serve. Breaking the business down by TCGs shows that 33% of our third quarter closings were first-time buyers, 35% were move-up buyers, and 32% were active adult buyers. As we've discussed on our last call, one of the primary differences between discussing brands versus TCGs is among first-time buyers. We continue to invest in developing infill communities under the Pulte Homes name, designed to serve first-time buyers, typically older millennials, who want to live closer-in and can afford to pay the higher prices such locations can typically command. For the quarter, the company reported gross margins of 23.6%, which represents a year-over-year increase of 70 basis points, and sequential increase of 30 basis points from Q2 of this year. Based on our current backlog, we anticipate Q4 gross margins to be consistent with the third quarter of this year. Q3 margins continued to benefit from increased option and lot premium revenues. In fact, option revenues increased 7%, or $3,300 per closing, and lot premiums increased 6%, or $674 per closing, compared with last year. Sales discounts in the quarter totaled just 2% per home, which is up roughly 30 basis points from last year, but still remains relatively modest at only $6,900 per closing. As our numbers indicate, our focus on driving greater profitability through our strategic pricing programs continues to yield benefits. Reported Q3 SG&A of $159 million, or 10.9% of home sale revenues, includes the benefit of approximately $6 million, resulting from a recent legal settlement realized by the company. I think it's important to also highlight the litigation-related charge we recorded in the quarter. PulteGroup received an unfavorable jury verdict in the amount of $20 million associated with a contract dispute. We have already filed post-trial motions seeking to, among other things, overturn the jury verdict, and are prepared to appeal the decision, should that action be required. However, in light of the decision, we recorded a reserve in the full amount of the jury award. The charges reflected on our income statement and other expense net. Our financial services segment reported pre-tax income of $14 million in the quarter, which is up from 11% in the comparable prior-year period. Our mortgage capture rate in Q3 increased to 83%, up from 80% in last year's third quarter. For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 40%, which is up slightly from last year and from our guidance. The higher rate was driven primarily by adjustments to our deferred tax assets, resulting from changes in certain state tax rates. Net income for the third quarter was $108 million, or $0.30 per share. Our per share earnings were calculated using approximately 353 million shares outstanding for the quarter, which is down 6% from last year, largely as a result of our share repurchase activities. Looking at our homebuilding operations, we ended the third quarter with 7,849 homes under construction, of which 17% were spec. Consistent with comments we made on our last earnings call, we're putting additional spec units into production with the goal of helping to even out quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in future construction cadence. Even with this increase, we ended Q3 with only 343 finished spec homes. Looking at our land position, we approved approximately 6,000 lots for purchase during the quarter, and ended the period with 137,000 lots under control. Approximately 41,000 of these lots, or 30% of our land position, are controlled via option. Continuing a trend you have seen over the past few years, we continue to strategically increase our use of land options as a way to enhance returns on our invested capital and to lower our overall risk profile. Of our controlled lots, approximately 24% are finished, and 17% are currently under development. While our land spend has been increasing, we continue to invest under a disciplined process that is focused on identifying well-located parcels that can generate higher risk adjusted returns. In addition to keeping our preference for closer-in locations, we are also seeking to manage the duration of our projects. In the quarter, we spent $586 million on land acquisition and development. Of this spend, 56% was for development of previously acquired land, and 44% was for the acquisition of new positions. This brings our total land investment for the first nine months of 2015 to $1.5 billion, and keeps us on track to invest the $2.3 billion previously announced. Excluding the handful of Del Webb positions we've added this year, the average lot count in our newly approved communities is roughly 100 homes. While generally keeping the duration of our projects shorter, means a lot of work for our operations teams, it helps to reduce the risks associated with any single land position. In addition to risk mitigation, another benefit of a disciplined land investment process is the better margins that well positioned land parcels can support. As Richard said, PulteGroup's strong margins are partly the result of our defined investment practices. Along with investing in the business, we returned $121 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 5.9 million common shares at an average price of $20.29 per share. In the third quarter, we executed a $500 million term loan agreement. The proceeds from this transaction are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Inclusive of these funds, the company ended the quarter with $760 million of cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 31%. On a year-over-year basis, signups in the third quarter were up 8%, to 4,092 homes. This reflects a 6% increase in our absorption paces over last year. On a dollar basis, signups increased 17%, to $1.5 billion as the average sales price in our backlog rose 7%, to $354,000. For the third quarter, the company operated out of 611 communities. This is up 2% from last year, and within the range of 610 to 625 communities we provided on our Q2 earnings call. As Richard highlighted, we ended the quarter with a backlog of 8,734 homes, with a value of $3.1 billion, which is up 18% over last year. Now, let me turn the call back to Richard. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Bob. Before opening the call to questions, let me provide some brief comments on the market conditions we experienced in third quarter. As you would anticipate given our increased signups and absorption paces, demand in the third quarter continued the positive trends we saw in the first half of 2015. On average, traffic to our communities was up over last year, and we continue to see opportunities to selectively push pricing through our strategic pricing programs. At a market level, we have not seen material shifts in demand conditions over the past several quarters. Broadly speaking, we continue to see better performance from communities that are closer-in and well located. More specific to the geographies, demand conditions in the third quarter were as follows : We continue to see good demand trends along the entire East Coast, but particularly as you look to the Southeast. Consistent with our comments we have made on many of our recent earnings calls, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida remain areas of strong demand. In the middle third of the country, demand conditions were generally positive, although we did note some meaningful volatility in the performance of individual markets. Looking specifically at Texas, total signups for the state were down about 5%, as the strength in Dallas' Q3 orders effectively offset softness in Houston and San Antonio. Land development and related community opening delays, caused by tough weather earlier in the year, certainly had an impact on sales for the quarter, and we are continuing to see some oil-related weakness in Houston, most notably at the higher selling prices. And finally, out West, we continue to experience robust demand across the major markets in California, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico. Let me close out our prepared remarks with a final thought. U.S. housing demand has been improving over the past few years, and we would say that it has been good in 2015. The reality is, however, that at a pace of 500,000, plus or minus, annual new home sales, the market is still 30% or more away from being just average. Assuming the economy continues to chug along, even at what most consider only a modest pace of growth, we expect new home sales can continue to grind higher in the coming years. As we have been saying since the housing recovery began, we expect the slope of the recovery will continue to be gradual, and there may be a pause or two along the way, but we believe there is more upside opportunity over the coming years. We see PulteGroup as being extremely well-positioned to be successful within this type of environment. We are putting incremental capital to work in the business, which we expect will support future growth. We continue to focus on construction and overhead efficiency to leverage that growth into greater earnings potential, and we are further enhancing that earnings potential by reducing outstanding shares and returning excess capital to our shareholders through dividends and routine share buybacks. We believe that this approach of running a balanced business through the cycle, versus trying to time the market, will benefit our shareholders over the long run. And, finally, let me close by thanking the employees of PulteGroup, who do an amazing job operating our business every day and who work passionately to deliver a great home buying experience to our customers. Let me now turn over the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications : Great. Thank you, Richard. We will now open the call for questions. So, that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Carol, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started. Operator : Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, gentlemen. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning. Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: My question \u2013 I'd like to follow-up a bit on the construction bottlenecks comment you made earlier, appeared to be impacting your conversion rates. If I'm understanding this correctly, it sounds like an issue with, I guess, obtaining and retaining labor? If that's the case, what can you do or what are you willing to do to remediate the issue, or are you comfortable with the lower conversion? And, I guess, are you offering incentives to buyers in your backlog like we've heard some of your peers doing? Would you be willing to offer incentives to people experiencing delays in home deliveries? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Haendel this is Richard. There's quite a few questions there. In general, labor is the primary culprit of our lower conversion. No, we're not happy about it, overall, it's clearly impacting our production. In general, we're having to pay more for labor, and we're beginning to work hard to try to source additional trades, either taking trades from some markets that have capacity to other markets, or look for additional trades in markets beyond the ones that we've been using. Having said that, it's going to be a slower process to correct than we had anticipated, which is one of the reasons why our conversion was weak this quarter. Having said that, we are not offering incentives to buyers to extend their closing. We're doing our best to estimate proper closing times when they sign contracts, so we have not had issues in that regard. And then finally, we are beginning to start a little bit more spec inventory at this time of year in order for additional deliveries to be available for us in the early part and middle part of 2016, in order to help even our production flow out, so we're not quite as spiked toward Q3 and Q4 like we have been. That's going to take some time to implement, but that's as many broad pieces of the issue as I can get to. Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Steve. Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI : Richard, maybe just talk a little bit more on the orders. You gave a nice roundup on what's happening geographically. Your absorption has moved up, your ASP moved up a bit. What's your strategy right now? You're also putting more specs on the ground. At this point, given your land spend, are you trying to drive absorptions much more quickly than you have in the past, or are you trying to ramp your margin as much as you can? I know that's been your strategy in the past, but just trying to understand if there has been any change here on your strategy? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Steve, there has been absolutely no change to be clear. Our absorption strength, we believe, is driven by good land locations and sticking to our discipline of driving as much price as we can, particularly in a constrained environment, where we're having difficulty getting homes delivered. With regard to increased spec, I want to be crystal clear. It's a modest increase in spec, and it's, frankly, timed when the spec inventory would be available during the strength of the selling season, which we would say would start, call it, late January through May or June. It's not sort of a broad brush change in strategy. But with only 17 of our homes in production being spec, we have cut it pretty far back, and we think there's an opportunity to potentially modestly even the flow of deliveries in the future, which will help reduce the dependence on this kind of maddening Q3 and Q4 spike at the end of the year. But no change in terms of policies with regard to discounting and/or driving absorptions over price. It's still a focus on return. We obviously balance both, but I will say, as evidenced by Bob's comments, this is the umpteenth quarter in a row that option \u2013 margin \u2013 excuse me \u2013 option dollar contributions and lot premiums are up, and that's not by accident. Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks. One thing I forgot to mention, before I go on to my next question. The West, you've categorized is robust, we've heard some rumblings recently that the West has slowed. One, I was wanting to know, if you're seeing anything on that? And then, as you look at your land spend, any difference in brand allocation, where you're going with it moving forward, or your regions? And what's land market look like as far as re-trading with costs moving up? Have you started to see more re-trading in the market? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. I'll start and then throw it to Bob for a little more color. With regard to the West, specifically, Stephen, Arizona is doing quite well. Our Northern California business continues to do well. We don't have as much investment as some in Southern Cal, but we are doing well with the good locations there. And then we have a pretty small business in Pac-Northwest that we're trying to ramp up, so it's not as relevant to our total; but in general, we're pleased with what we see. With regard to land spend, we're continuing to allocate most of the dollars to the Pulte brand and selective Del Webb positions as we rotate out of others, with a little bit less in the Centex brand, but as Bob highlighted, we're beginning to put more money into the first-time category that served through the Pulte brand for this urban millennial category in many markets, which we have really good demand characteristics from. With regard to land pricing and any re-trading, I've not heard of much, but Bob, any more color on land pricing? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. As we've talked about, we're typically staying closer into the core. We haven't seen a significant pullback there. It's still competitive for just about every position we look at, and we're not seeing a lot of returning. Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my call. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Good morning. First question, just touching back on labor for a minute, if we can. It's been widely talked about that there's been labor constraints in the market, but our feeling was that it was kind of isolated to markets like Colorado and Texas. Are you seeing more of a widespread impact at this point? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : John, this is Richard. The Journal had an article a couple of weeks ago that referenced this. It is definitely widespread. There's no question about it. There's not a market in the country that we're not experiencing some degree of labor shortage pressure. So, yes, it's definitely more than just Texas and Colorado. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And it may be a different trade base, depending upon the geography that you're dealing with. It may be framers in one area, it may be masons in another, but you can find it across most of our major markets. John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: That's helpful. Thanks. And then, moving on, there has been some bank data that has come out, and some of the retailers have even talked about the environment in Texas just starting to soften even more than some had expected. You guys are just still seeing it kind of at the higher end, is that correct? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The higher end in Houston, to be more specific. I think, as we indicated, Dallas had a good quarter. Houston and San Antonio effectively offset that to give us that negative 5% comp; so, candidly, it doesn't feel a lot different than it has for most of the year with some oil related softening at the higher end, and Houston being the primary driver of Texas weakness. John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much, guys. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Alan. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: So, I know the focus this morning is obviously on the construction delays, but I was actually hoping to ask a question on another topic, which I think is a big focal point of Pulte investors, which is the growth potential over the next few years. And as we look here at your forward-looking growth indicators here, your land spend is going to be up about 30% this year. Your lot count is up double-digits over the last couple years. Your SG&A dollars are up about 10% year-over-year, which usually come in advance of community count growth. And I know you've been reluctant to talk about community count guidance in the past, but when I look at all those metrics, it points to inflection point that should be coming soon. And what I was really hoping you could give is a little bit of a blueprint on where you see the business growing over the next several years? Are we wrong to extrapolate those numbers and think that growth should eventually break out of this low single-digit range that you've been in, on the community count side for the last couple of years? And any timing and magnitude of that, I think, would be helpful, just in framing expectations out there? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, Alan, this is Richard. First of all, we will be giving community count guidance on the Q4 call, as we traditionally do. It gives us a little better window as we get to our planning season right now, as we put our business plan together for 2016. Having said that, we certainly expect growth in the future years. The investment ramp-up that you're seeing is definitely having an impact. I will point out that we specifically, in our script, emphasized our future earnings potential, and we also talked about volume potential, but we're really focused on driving earnings and return, over time. So, my point is that dollars spent, depending on where they are spent, don't create lots equally. And, frankly, as an example, for investing in the Southeast or Texas, we're getting quite a few more lots than if we're in Northern California, and we had been reasonably balanced with our overall investment. So, that's why community count to us is only partially the indicator, and why we're emphasizing absorption rates for community. Having said all that, Alan, we do expect growth in the out-years, from here. I'm not in a position to tell you how much that is, but we haven't been ramping up our investment spend to stay flat. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it. Thank you. And if I could squeeze in a second one. I was hoping you could just give us your construction cycle timelines, where they're running today versus a year ago, and any margin impact that you expect these delays to have going forward as you look out over the next few quarters? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, our cycle time is roughly, and this is rough. I'm not going to give granular detail. About 10% higher, in terms of overall construction cycle times, versus, say, a year ago. Indicative of the labor shortages that we're seeing. I'm sorry, Alan. What was the second piece of that? Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Just any potential impact on margin as a result of these delays on deliveries? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I don't think there is much of a margin impact based on delays. We have not heard, I've been talking to our operators frequently, of incentives or any offerings to consumers. I think we're doing a good job of setting expectations when we sign a contract that, as an example, instead of a home being delivered five months out, it may be seven months or eight months out based on where we slot in the production cycle. So, that, in and of itself, I don't think has much impact on margin. Now, again, we're not providing forward margin guidance beyond what Bob's prepared remarks said about Q4, which we expect to be approximately where we are in Q3. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Alan, the only thing I'd add to that is, and it goes to the question of labor rates and pricing. We have seen, obviously, some pressure on that. So, the 1.5%-ish increase in house costs that we've said is probably likely a little bit higher this year, as a result of that. Offsetting that is a relatively benign commodity market. So, you can see it in our margins this quarter sequentially, being up 30 basis points. Now, there's interest benefit in that, but the homebuilding margin has stayed flat, and it's our expectation that, based on the backlog, we see that through the end of the year. So, it doesn't necessarily translate to margin compression, just because we've got time extension. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it. Thanks and good luck. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Mike. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Mike. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question on \u2013 just going back to the gross margins for a moment. A little bit better, I think, than we were looking for, perhaps than what you were implying in your guidance last quarter. And I just wanted to get a sense of, number one, to the extent that's true, it was maybe a little bit better, what was driving that? And as you look into 2016, I know you don't want to give guidance at this point, but, just strategically, you've talked in the past about not going too far down the rabbit hole, chasing the entry-level buyer, given that you feel that the absorption isn't there yet, to justify the lower gross margins. If that's something that as you kind of balance margin versus, perhaps, incremental segment in that area, is there a balance? Are you willing to kind of increase that by a little bit? I know the Centex piece, which you consider more entry-level, is more focused on that segment and seems to continue to shrink. Just how to think about that segment's influence on gross margins going forward? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Mike, this is Richard. I have a couple thoughts in that regard. First of all, we're not going to give specific margin targets for next year. I would suspect that most of our margin performance will be driven by whatever costs are coming through the pipeline with regard to land and house. And, obviously, offset by whatever the revenue side is from a selling environment. The reason I point that out, is we do not intend to kind of change our strategy with regard to our focus. You pointed out the declining focus on entry-level. I'll just point out that the first-time buyer, as reflected in some of these urban projects, we are ramping up some investment in overall. But it's really going to be largely dependent on what happens when we get into the spring selling season, in terms of what kind of margins we deliver next year, along with the land costs coming through. And just lastly, I will tell you that our Centex margins continue to be strong, even though we're driving a combination of pace and price there. So, again, I apologize for not providing details for you in terms of guidance going forward. I think the most relevant thing you can take away is, we're not intending to change our strategy. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And just so I'm clear on that question. Was the gross margins maybe a little bit better than expected in 3Q \u2013 and then my second question is \u2013 and if that's so, what was driving that? And my second question is, the interest expense amortization continues to come down. Directionally, should we expect that to continue in 2016 as a percent of sales and on an absolute basis? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So, on Q3 margins, obviously mix matters, Mike. The margins were in line with what we expected. The relative mix of it moved it a little bit. But, we don't have complete vision of what our margins are going to be. So, when we said 23.3%-ish (34:23) that is reflective of what we saw actually in the third quarter. On interest expense, no commentary yet on next year. Although, our cash spend has been less than what we're expensing, so you can expect it to go down more. We'll give some color on that towards the end of the year. But, as a percentage of sales, you'd have to look at what your model projects for volumes. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is actually Matt (35:01) on for Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just with respect to the challenging production environment, you were very clear that labor was the bulk of that. But was it all labor issues you're referring to or is there something else on the land development side, or even lingering weather delays that we should be thinking about? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Matt (35:27), we indicated in our prepared remarks, it was primarily labor, but there was also some community delays, primarily from earlier in the year, that impacted our ability to get homes begun on time, and then ultimately get closed on time, that had a portion of it. So, the way to read it is, the majority was labor, some of it was community opening delays, and I think Bob indicated in his prepared remarks, some of that was driven by weather from earlier in the year that got us started slower than expected, and we were not able to make up as much ground as we anticipated. But the majority of it was labor. Unknown Speaker : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, you disclosed a very balanced mix of a first-time move-up and active adult. So, just wondering if you could provide some historical context. How has that looked year-over-year? And then, maybe the relative strength of each one currently? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, this is Richard. I can speak to a couple pieces there. We just began the break-out of first-time move-up in active adult last quarter. So, we don't have a huge amount of historical data at our fingertips. Perhaps, we could get back to you later with some detail, if we can find it there. In terms of the demand characteristics for each category, both the first-time category, as well as the move-up category, had strong absorption growth for the quarter. I don't have at my fingertips the exact numbers. And then active adult was relatively flat, it was actually slightly down on a same-store sales basis, from prior. But the other two categories were up fairly strongly. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my \u2013 I guess, my second question. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : There you go. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sorry about that. Too many pieces in the first one. Sorry about that. Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Looks like you caught me trying to be sneaky there. I guess the question I had is a bit on the absorption pace trend during the quarter in each segment, and how it's currently trending. Can you give some color on that? And then a little color on the weakness in San Antonio, please? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Through the quarter, Haendel, if I'm understanding your question, through the quarter, we were relatively sort of normal seasonality there. Didn't see a tremendous amount of variation through the quarter. So, if you are asking sort of sequentially, there was nothing unusual there. We didn't see one month in the quarter spike. In terms of San Antonio, did you ask specifically? We had some weakness in San Antonio, along with Houston, kind of offset by Dallas. It wasn't anything dramatic, but the net combine there had us down 5% in Texas. Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Can you give us a little color on what's driving the weakness, though, in San Antonio, a little bit of market color? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Candidly, I don't have much more because it, frankly, wasn't a big move, one way or another. So, we didn't get real granular on that one. So, we could certainly look for that after the call, if we want to get back to you. But there was nothing unusual driving things in San Antonio. It wasn't a gigantic drop. Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is open. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Good morning. Question for Bob. Looking at the backlog conversion for the fourth quarter, you guys have been in the high-60%s the last couple of years. And I just want to get some clarification. I think your commentary was, it would be better than that, am I understanding you correctly? And are you able to maybe put a sharper point on how we should think about conversion rates into the fourth quarter, given some of the delays? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think what we were saying was not that it was better than that, but we'd be moving towards it, and that we would seek to catch up on the difference for what we've left on the table, to this point this year, through the first half of next year. And you're right. The last two years or three years, we've been 66%, 67%. And so, that is something that we will look to get towards, but I wouldn't say we told you we were going to beat it. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thanks. And then I know you had said earlier, you haven't been incenting to keep buyers in the backlog, but have you seen any change in cancellation rates with the construction delays? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. The sales environment continues to be strong and, frankly, the level of inventory out there continues to be modest. So, those would both indicate not significant cancellation worries, and we certainly are not seeing a spike. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, actually, third quarter versus third quarter, it's 17.1% this year, it was 17.6% last year. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good morning. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Bob. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I noticed in new orders, it looks like your average selling price rose from $331,000 last year, to $358,000 this quarter, and that's an 8% year-over-year increase. And that's one of the better trends we've seen out of the homebuilders that are reported. What's driving the big uptick in order growth ASP? And is that something \u2013 and I know you're not giving forward guidance, but how critical is that in terms of offsetting higher labor costs and sustaining a 23% gross margin? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Bob, this is Richard. It's reflective of a couple things. One is just the shifting mix from the prior investments that we've made in the Pulte category, the move-up category, primarily, which would have been our 2014 and early 2015 investments beginning to sort of come through. And then secondly, obviously, the pricing environment. In terms of its overall impact on margins and profitability, again, we're not trying to give any projections for 2016, but ASPs matter. I'll just point out, it's one quarter, and we have to see what ASPs develop like, say, in Q4, as it reflects into our next year's backlog, et cetera. But it was a pretty significant move, you're right. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's nice momentum. And for Bob, I was surprised by the SG&A which looked a little bit elevated versus what I was thinking. I know you had a reversal of a charge in there, as well. Is this kind of like a transitory situation with lower revenues, when you convert your backlog you're going to get very good revenue growth? How should we be thinking, not just this quarter, because I'm not that concerned about it, but longer term about normalized SG&A levels as a percentage of revenues? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Bob, certainly the volume of the business impacts our ability to leverage our overheads, and as we've talked about before, because commissions don't flow through our SG&A, our SG&A is much more fixed than others might be. Certainly, we've got start-up and we've talked about the fact that, with all the community turnover this year, our start-up expenses are up. So I think, actually, about 25% of the increase year-over-year relates to community-related spend. But, certainly, we think that it is leveragable, because so much of it is fixed on a relative basis. And just to highlight, with the $6 million net benefit, if you exclude that, we were $165 million of spend for SG&A, and as we had said at the beginning of the year, we predict to be between $160 million and $165 million every quarter. So it was consistent with what we expected to spend. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : But, I'm just trying to understand, next year you are expecting to get better operating leverage off the SG&A line, correct? Like from... Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, we'll provide some color going into the year of what we think our SG&A spend will be. And then, obviously, as Richard talked about, we've been investing to try and grow the top line. So, yeah, we think it's leveragable over time. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Good luck, guys. Thank you very much. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks very much, guys. Your land spend expectations of $2.3 billion this year, just even taking or adjusting for the delays on closings in this quarter, it seems like you're sort of targeting around 38% or something in that vicinity as a percentage of revenues, which is quite high, particularly given the fact that you already have close to 100,000 lots owned. So, I was wondering, are you implying a geographic or price-point repositioning that's forthcoming? Just given the fact that you have a very significant amount of land-owned already. You are forecasting a fairly elevated level of land spend now. Just wondering whether or not there's maybe certain areas that you feel your current land base can't provide you the opportunity to go into, and so that's some of what is driving the increased land spend? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Steve, this is Richard. I'll offer three or four different pieces, there. First of all, roughly a third of our total lot count is still tied up in Del Webb positions, many of which are long-lived positions, and that trend is going to take years to modify. There's only so much we can drive out of each existing Del Webb position. So, when you look at our overall balance of land, you have to factor that in as a significant chunk, makes our matrix look a little different than others. Secondly, Bob pointed out in the prepared remarks that we are skewing our land investment towards the shorter end, and most of our new land investment communities are roughly around 100 homes each, so at any kind of a normalized absorption pace, that's no more than a couple of year's worth in each land position. So, while our land spend is certainly up, the characterization of it or the mix of it is significantly different than Pulte's habits in the past of investing in very large transactions with long trajectories of six years, seven years, eight years at a time. So, the total health of our balance sheet as it relates to land, frankly, continues to get better and better. And then thirdly, we continue to be very disciplined with regard to the way we're allocating capital, and our risk adjusted return criteria, we believe, is keeping us in check, as evidenced by the fact that our margins haven't fallen 200 basis points or 300 basis points or 400 basis points, which would be indicative, potentially, of reaching. So, we are trying to grow the business. We feel good about sort of the long-term potential for housing over the next few years. But, we are paying attention, and we've seen nothing yet to suggest that over the next, two years, three years, four years, we should be worried, but just to keep our bets safe, we're investing the majority of things in shorter positions. And then finally, I'd just point out that roughly 60% of our total spend in the quarter was development. Only about 40% is new acquisition dollars. So, for what it's worth, that's investing to bring lots on where we already have invested. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Steve, just to put a finer point on that, it's raw land. So, the land we've been buying over the last couple of years, we are now developing, and so the spend is on bringing those lots to fruition. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it, yeah. I mean, your answer's one and three, I resonate strongly with. I would just say that the second point about how you are skewing your investment to smaller communities, I mean, that still would suggest that, let's say, your recent land spend is going to be what you are building on over the next couple of years. It still leaves the question of the existing land bank that's there, so whether you are buying more sort of shorter-dated lots, or whether you are using up kind of a FIFO basis, it still leaves you with a very large land position. But I hear you on the points one and three. I guess my second question relates to the labor issues that we've heard a lot about. I was curious as to whether or not, in addition to some of the other considerations that you weigh when contemplating going out to the entry-level market more aggressively, if, underlying your assessment about opportunity, if the production challenges you're seeing from tight labor makes targeting this segment even less appealing than it did before? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Steve, to be clear, we're focused really on the first-time buyer, as opposed to the entry-level buyer. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And there's a difference. The first-time buyer is typically \u2013 we're seeing a $300,000 to $400,000 urban product serve them. And I'm not hearing or seeing differences in labor challenges there versus any other segment. I just want to comment on your point, too, around land spend. We hear you that we have a large land bank. And I guess the point I'm trying to make is that you can only get so much out of existing communities that have large lot positions, but the total dollars that we have invested in the business are going into shorter and shorter positions, which we feel like is a really good risk mitigation tool and is far different than our prior behavior. So, you have to dig beneath the numbers to really appreciate the way we're running the business. And frankly, we can't be focused on returns so aggressively and not pay a lot of attention to the balance sheet. So, we hear your concern and I want you to know we are paying attention to that a lot. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Well, I appreciate that, and thanks very much for the answers. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Your line is open. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Susan. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : You mentioned in your comments that you're at about 60% of your closings are commonly managed. That's up pretty considerably year-over-year. Given all of these issues that we've talked about on this call, how do you think that that has helped you, or how do you think the commonly managed plans have helped with that? And maybe are there any changes in the way you are rolling it out, given what you are facing? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Susan, I would say, if anything, the commonly managed plans give us an advantage in two regards. One is our absorption pace. The commonly managed plans are all consumer tested. We have a warehouse facility here in Atlanta that we bring buyers through to test all of our plans before we put them out into the field, and I think our absorption rates per community are being helped by designs, candidly, that our consumers tell us they really like. And then specifically, we believe it's helping to hold up our margins. That, along with the pricing data that Bob gave are the two components that we feel are helpful, so those are the benefits from commonly managed plans, and we're really pleased that it's this big a portion of our total production. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then at the beginning of this month, we finally had the implementation (50:58) of TRID that came in. Have you seen any disruptions related to that or anything that has changed meaningfully? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, certainly for us, I would tell you we were ready for it. We have loans in production under the new process. Actually some of them are slated to close in October. I think it's too soon to tell from an industry perspective. I'm hearing that people were generally ready, smaller mortgage lenders might be having a little bit more systemic issues with it, and so time will tell. But we haven't seen it as an impediment to this point. So, so far, so good. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Following up on Susan's question about the new mortgage rules. With their initial proposed implementation being right at the beginning of the fourth quarter, was there any volatility around your order flows, or trying to get contracts and mortgage applications in? And, really, I guess the question there would be, was there any pull forward of orders from 4Q into 3Q, as a result of that original implementation date? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Certainly not for us, Nishu. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Great. And I know there has been a lot of discussion about the cost issues. Just taking a step back. I think the broad-level concern that investors have is that, with labor and then, obviously, land as well, prices running the way that they have, that the dynamic is if they would threaten \u2013 and it would threaten to overwhelm pricing power, which has obviously slowed from where it was a year or two ago. And, therefore, threaten the longer-term profitability of the business. I know, obviously, you're not, and you've said this many times, giving forward guidance; but Richard, as you sit back and look at the dynamics that are in place right now, would you share that concern? Is that a legitimate concern? Or do you see a situation in which it's a healthy dynamic which is driving those cost increases, and therefore, there should be the pricing power longer-term to match those cost increases. Or do you share that concern about the unhealthy dynamic? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Nishu, I'll say it this way. I understand people's concern about it, overall. I can simply tell you that, given our visibility into our backlog, we have not yet seen it manifest itself in terms of significant pressure. Given our Q4 closings that are upcoming, as we've indicated, we expect margins, frankly, to be about what they are in Q3, which is a very robust level. Again, I won't comment on margins going forward. We don't have enough visibility to really do that. We'll try to give you as much as we can each quarter regarding kind of the next quarter, overall. So, I certainly understand it, but I do think that the normal tendency in this industry that I've seen in my time, has been for us to be able to get price generally to offset costs. I can't guarantee that that's the case going forward, but that would be an expectation that would be reasonable based on what we've seen throughout the industry. I do think that there is an acute shortage of some trades today that have not come back as quickly into this business after the last downturn, and I think it's been elongated more than many, including us, in the industry would have expected. Having said that, we'll work our way through it, and live to fight another day, so to speak. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Morning, gentlemen. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Ken. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Ken. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So, your gross margins, at the 26% level, pre the interest, have been steady. I wonder, could you highlight some of these components? Because your commonly managed plan, which obviously was part of your redesign process, in addition to just being very steady and focusing on a more, capital-return model. Could you highlight how much that community, you said, Richard, that you think it's helping. I assume you have some metrics around that? Talk about the labor, how much that's going up? And have you considered paying the people more to get more labor on-site? Because some larger builders haven't really highlighted this labor issue, but they've done more. So, I'm just trying to figure out the different components, as you think about your very steady gross margins? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, well, certainly, our margins, we think, are a factor or are impacted by lots of things. First of all, the land we're buying, the process we're using, the value creation efforts that we've talked about. So, you've seen lot premiums increasing, options increasing. Maintaining low discounts because we're not doing a lot of spec building. Clearly, things that will influence our margin going forward are; land prices are going up, so we'll have an increase there, and labor rates will change depending on different markets. So, I don't think you can point to any one thing, commonly managed plans or anything else, that says this is why margins are what they are. It's the way we're approaching the business and all those different things that we think will allow us, over time, to generate higher gross margins than we historically would have. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And Ken, this is Richard. Just to add one other quick thing. Higher relative to what others may be doing with their business. To Bob's point, our business model is such that we believe the commonly managed plans, the pricing, et cetera, help us to stay at the high end. We are obviously subject to market conditions. We're subject to labor pressure. We are paying more for labor than we have. But on a relative basis, we continue to outperform on the margin line, we think, because of all the pieces that Bob ran through. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. You obviously, at your Analyst Day talked about capital allocation, but you're sitting on quite a bit of cash. You're starting to buy back. You're having measured spend on your land more geared to developments, which means you can obviously harvest that land. Have you got a little more comfortable around, perhaps, liquidity levels that we should target? I mean, you're at about 30% now. I mean, as we model rising cash, can we just always assume you're going to be largely putting that back into sales, given your moderate view on how the housing recovery is unfolding? I mean, you guys have bought back... Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, as we highlighted, we like leverage between 30% and 40%. We were underlevered coming into this quarter, obviously, you saw we borrowed some money late in the third quarter, and you'll see in the Q that we actually were borrowed on our revolver at a point in time during the quarter. So, most of liquidity that we had we spent during the quarter. Obviously, as closings start to ramp up and with the borrowings, we ended the quarter with a fairly sizable cash position, but we're working with that too. So, we highlight that we have a pretty big spend on land and development in the fourth quarter, roughly $800 million. We've talked about the dividend, we've obviously been buying back stock. So, we're looking out over the next 12 months and looking at the capital profile, and we like where we sit today, at 30% or 31% debt-to-cap. So, it's not as much about managing what's the dollars that we want to keep in the bank, because those move every day. It's how do we keep liquidity sufficient to do the things we want to do. And our capital market activity will help to drive that, offset, obviously, by closings. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee CRT : Morning, everyone. First question I had, could you give us a sense of what percentage of closings have been spec versus dirt over the last couple of quarters? And then also maybe the gross margin differential between those two that you've seen? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Jay, I'm not sure... Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Jay, we're digging to see if we have that... Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So, just for perspective, we... [Audio Break] (1:00:06-1:00:23) Operator : Participants, please stand by. This is the operator. I apologize that there's been a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold, and the conference will resume as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience. [Audio Break] (1:00:34-1:02:30) Thank you again for your patience on today's call. We are still experiencing a slight delay in the call. Please hold, and the conference will resume momentarily. [Audio Break] (1:02:39-1:03:43) And thank you for your patience today. We're now ready to resume today's conference. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Jay, are you on the line? Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee CRT : I am. Can you hear me? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We can. Sorry. Did you get any of our answer? Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee CRT : No, I didn't. Sorry. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Can you repeat your question? We'll start all over again. I apologize to everybody else on the line. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. No problem. Was just trying to get a sense of the gross margin spread between spec and dirt and what percentage over the last couple of quarters have been spec closings versus dirt closings? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Jay, I don't know exactly what the closing profile is, but what we can tell you is that for the last couple of years, we've been between 15% and 20% spec starts. And what we've talked about for a couple of years now is we don't mind spec starts at all, because you don't see much margin degradation, as long as you sell it before it finals. The other thing I can tell you is we have very little spec final on the ground. We were at 340-ish units at the end of September, and that number has held pretty constant over time. So, again, we are not uncomfortable with spec. The margin differential isn't big, unless you have three or four of them on the ground at one point in time, in which case, oftentimes, you have to discount the homes. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee CRT : Got it. I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should model a little bit more spec coming in in 2016. The other question I had, with you guys taking out the term loan, should we expect you to redeem the 2016 notes, the, I think it's $480 million. Should we expect you guys to redeem those at maturity and then look to refinance the term loan? Or how are you thinking about the debt structure at this point? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, we've talked about it for a couple of years now, in terms of how we're looking at maturity profile. Obviously, we went short on this particular one. The rate is very attractive, the market was very supportive, and it happened to be at a point in time when the capital markets were a little bit unsteady. So, we really like the execution on the term loan that we did. Looking forward, obviously, a lot of it will depend on capital needs, timing of that. Obviously, the big maturity is the one that's next year. And that obviously factors into every or any decision that we're going to make over the next nine months before we get there. So, no firm commitment on how and when we'll deal with that, but it's sort of next in the queue. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee CRT : Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I know we're way over time, so I appreciate you staying on to answer a couple more questions. Going back to the comment about the active adult segment, and I think you said that absorption there was slightly down year-over-year, on a same store basis. I was wondering if you could just give us some commentary about, are you surprised that the active adult segment is not seeing maybe a stronger lift or better absorption at this stage of the cycle? Is there anything in particular about the Del Webb product that's notable about, or maybe location-wise, that's affecting that absorption trend? And have you thought about maybe introducing a different kind of Del Webb product? Could you go more urban or maybe high-rise with the Del Webb brand as well? Any thoughts on that? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Buck, this is Richard. The active adult buyer is obviously continuing to read sort of the broader signals overall, and they typically do lag more than the other categories. Having said that, we did close out several positions in the Southeast part of the country that were Del Webb, that probably had as much to do with it as anything. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And maybe I missed it earlier in the call. Did you guys give the net order comparisons by brand in this quarter? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think we did. Although, I indicated that both the first-time category, as well as the move-up category, were up nicely, and then Webb was down some... Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay.

I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 2015 PulteGroup Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Sean and good morning to everyone participating in the conference call to discuss PulteGroup\u2019s fourth quarter financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President, and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller. A copy of this morning\u2019s earnings release and the presentation slide that accompanies today\u2019s discussion are posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We will also post an audio replay of today\u2019s call to the site later today. Let me remind all the participants that today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup\u2019s future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by any comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. With that said, now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard? Richard Dugas : Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m extremely pleased to \u2013 with PulteGroup\u2019s fourth quarter earnings which show significantly improved results across key business metrics. In addition to ending 2015 with very strong results, our fourth quarter operating and financial performance provide a foundation we can build on in 2016. As we capitalize on opportunities to accelerate the growth of our homebuilding business. Bob, will go through a detailed review of our Q4 financials in a moment. But there are a couple of numbers and points that I\u2019d like to highlight. Order rates in the fourth quarter were up 13%, which is the biggest year-over-year percentage jump we have realized since 2012. As solid as this number is, what I view even more encouraging is the 9% gain in absorption pace that we realized in the quarter. We\u2019ve always said the generating higher sales within our existing footprint is the most efficient way for us to grow volumes and ultimately earnings. Pulte\u2019s disciplined approach to acquiring the right land positions over the past several years is having a positive impact on our results. Along with order rates, the average sales price we\u2019re able to realize for our homes continue to increase. In the fourth quarter closing ASPs were up 6% to $353,000, while backlog ASP is gained 10% to $365,000. Between market opportunities, mix shifts and ongoing implementation of our strategic pricing programs, we expect ASPs will continue to move higher in 2016 versus comparable quarters in 2015. Our recently closed purchase of assets from John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods will further our pricing gains given their higher price points. I also want to highlight our gross margins, which at 23.5% is up 40 basis points over last year and remains arguably among the highest in the industry. As we have discussed for the past several years, we have implemented a number of programs from product and purchasing zones and commonly managed plans to \u2013 should costing and strategic pricing. As an example, almost 60% of our fourth quarter closings were from commonly managed plans that have the benefit of increased consumer feedback and more efficient floor plan design. The goal of all this work has been to improve sales paces and gross margins in support of delivering higher returns on invested capital. A lot of time and effort has been invested in implementing these initiatives and the gains are evident in our results. Given that the financial improvements we realized in the quarter were so broad based, I can highlight a number of other metrics in my comments. I purposely picked order rates, ASPs and gross margin because there is at least one common element which I believe is an important factor in all three metrics. That common element is land. In 2011, we launched the value creation strategy, with its focus on delivering higher returns on invested capital over the housing cycle. By 2013, we had raised returns to the point where they exceeded our cost of capital. Since that time, we have purposely increased investment into the business, because it makes economic sense to do so. While we have raised investment, we have done so while adhering to the guidelines and disciplines we put in place back in 2011. These disciplines include underwriting projects to a defined 13 point risk rating scorecard that helps ensure we select the highest returning projects, focusing in on land positions that are closer into job centers and located in the better markets and sub-markets, prudently using options which now account for 31% of all lots and 34% of our more traditional Pulte and Centex land positions to help enhance returns and/or mitigate land risk. Even though, we are having to develop over 70% of the lots we use, we have systematically expanded the percentage of option lots we maintain. We continue to emphasize investing in shorter, faster turning projects with an average investment cycle of 36 to 48 months from acquisition to completion. By focusing in on shorter duration projects, we help to minimize risk should a housing downturn emerge sooner than expected. As an example, we expect to recruit the capital we invested in the John Wieland assets in less than four years. And we expect the purchase to be accretive to company returns by year two. By strategically investing in land over the past few years, we have assembled a robust land pipeline that should allow PulteGroup to grow at a rate consistent with or ideally ahead of the overall housing market. Our just completed Wieland transaction will certainly support this effort. The John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods brand is highly regarded in the Southeast particularly within the luxury buyer category. Beyond the opportunities we see to expand this position, we also see the potential to deploy our Pulte brand on to certain Wieland land positions as we work to increase volumes and accelerate future absorption of the acquired lots, again enhancing returns. By focusing as intently on the quality, not just the quantity of the land assets we acquire. We put ourselves in the best position to maximize sales pace, pricing, margins and most importantly returns on invested capital while working to mitigate excess market risk. Through our value creation strategy, we have now put the company in a position to grow. While continuing to generate better financial performance and consistently returning funds to our shareholders. And we have done all this while taking a more conservative lower risk approach to our business. Growth, stronger returns and properly managed risk. We think this is a great combination. Now let me turn over the call to Bob, for a more thorough review of the quarter. Bob? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Richard and good morning. The gains demonstrated in PulteGroup\u2019s Q4 financial results are direct reflection of the meaningful improvements we\u2019ve continued to realize in our homebuilding operations. As I will detail, these gains can be seen throughout our fourth quarter financial savings. Fourth quarter homebuilding revenues totaled $2 billion, which is up 12% from prior year revenues of $1.8 billion. The increase in Q4 revenue is driven by a 7% increase in closings to 5,662 homes, combined with a 6% increase in average sales price $353,000. Although not a metric, we managed against, the 5,662 homes closed in the fourth quarter, equates to a backlog conversion rate of 65%. As we addressed in our most recent calls, we are working to close the year-over-year performance gap we\u2019ve experienced with regard to getting homes delivered. We are pleased with the progress we made in the fourth quarter. Having said that, the challenges we and the industry face with regard to labor resources and extended land development timelines are not likely to improve in the near-term. We believe however, there are decision to prudently increase spec production, should help us to maintain a more consistent build cadence going forward. In the quarter, closings by brands were as follows : 19% of homes were from Centex communities. 55% were from Pulte communities and 26% were from Del Webb. In the fourth quarter of last year closing from Centex, Pulte and Del Webb were 24%, 46% and 30% respectively. Given the profile of projects we are investing in, coupled with the projected impact of assets acquired in the Wieland transaction, we believe that describing our customers by buyer group, rather than by brand will better represent the makeup of our business. As a result beginning in Q1, we will address buyer groups rather than brands. In the fourth quarter, closings by buyer group were as follows : 31% were first time buyers, 40% were move-up buyers and 29% were active adult buyers. In 2014, closings by buyer group were 34% first time, 33% move-up and 33% active adult. The company reported gross margins of 23.5% in the fourth quarter, which is up 40 basis points over the prior year. As it\u2019s been an ongoing trend, fourth quarter margins were enhanced by higher option and lot premium revenues. In fact, option revenues in the quarter increased 10% or $4,976 per closing, while lot premiums gained 16% or $1,868 per closing. Sales discounts remained modest, it just 2.2% or $8,026 per home, compared with 2.1% or $7,040 per home last year. This implementing our strategic pricing programs and 2011 as part of our value creation strategy, option revenues per home have increased by $19,800 or 58%, while lot premiums per home have increased by approximately $7,100 or 107%. We believe our more strategic approach to pricing has been a key contributor to the high gross margins we continue to maintain. Reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $139 million or 7% of home sale revenues, included the benefit of a $30 million reversal of construction related insurance reserves. Reported prior year SG&A expense of $146 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues, reflected at $15 million reversal of construction related insurance reserves. Looking at the full-year, our reported SG&A of $590 million, which was 10.2% of homebuilding revenues, includes the benefit of $62 million or 110 basis points, associated with certain legal settlements and reserve reversals. PulteGroup\u2019s financial services segment reported fourth quarter pre-tax income of $29 million, which includes the reversal of $12 million in mortgage repurchase reserves. The decision to reduce reserves is based on probable settlement of various repurchase requests and current conditions. Mortgage capture rate in Q4 was 83%, up from 81% in the prior year. I would like to take a moment to highlight the efforts of our financial services team, including Pulte Mortgage and PGP title and meeting the challenges in the new regulatory environment under TRID. Our teams did a tremendous job closing Pulte Mortgage loans, without missing a beat and supporting our customers under the new rules. Deb Still, our President and CEO of Financial Services and her team are recognized leaders in the industry and did a fantastic job, implementing the changes needed to operate within the new TRID guidelines. Looking at net income for the fourth quarter, we reported $228 million or $0.64 per share, which includes $0.07 per share of benefit from insurance and mortgage reserve reversals taken in the quarter. Our per share earnings were calculated using approximately 352 million shares outstanding for the quarter, which is down 6% from last year, largely as a result of our share repurchase activities. As part of our income statement review, we wanted to provide some thoughts about 2016, given our backlog in anticipated land, labor and material costs. We expect 2016 homebuilding margins, inclusive of the diluted effect of the Wieland transaction to remain high and be in the range of 21.5% to 22%. This annual margin guidance includes a negative impact of the Wieland transaction of approximately 100 basis points, in the first quarter 80 basis points in the second quarter and 50 basis points, in each of the third and fourth quarters. Looking at our projected SG&A, we expect our full year spend will be approximately 10% of homebuilding revenues. Consistent with prior years, this will be impacted on a quarterly basis, by the seasonality of our closings. Based on the margin and overhead guidance we just provided, the calculated operating margin we expect to generate in 2016 is between 11.5% and 12%. The operating margin we reported for 2015 was 13.2% but this was enhanced by the 110 basis points impact from the construction related insurance reserve reversals we recorded during the year. When you consider that our 2016 operating margin guidance of 11.5% to 12% is being negatively impacted by roughly 70 basis points from the Wieland transaction and factoring the 110 basis point enhancement to 2015 operating margins. You can see that operating margins will actually flat to slightly improved in 2016 compared to 2015. Given headwinds the industry is facing on land and labor costs, we\u2019re very proud to be able to maintain our strong operating margins. Putting all this together, the combination of expected higher closing volumes, higher ASPs and overhead leverage have us positioned for strong earnings growth in 2016. Moving past the income statement and reviewing our homebuilding operations, we ended the fourth quarter with a total of 6,494 homes under construction. Spec units accounted for 30% of the homes under production, which is up from 26% at this time last year. As discussed, we have purposely increased the amount of spec homes we have in the pipeline to help maintain a more even construction cadence. In the fourth quarter, we approved approximately 7,000 lots for purchase excluding the Wieland assets, as that deal close to mid-January. We ended the year with 138,000 lots under control, of which approximately 42,000 lots or 31% were controlled via option. We continue to seek out opportunities to increase our use of land options in an effort to enhance returns and/or lower our overall risk profile. Of our controlled lots, approximately 23% are finished and 18% are currently under development. As Richard discussed, we continue to use the defined and disciplined approach to our land investment. Consistent with our land acquisition guidelines, we invested $485 million in land acquisition in Q4, and an additional $304 million for development of previously acquired lots. These investments brought our full year land related spend to $2.3 billion. For the year, we invested approximately $1.2 billion to acquire new land. Looking ahead to 2016, including the money invested to acquire the Wieland assets, we have authorized $1.6 billion for land acquisitions. As always, this level of investment is predicated on our continuing assessment of the market, and on our ability to identify suitable high returning projects. Looking at our capital allocated to shareholders in the fourth quarter. We distributed $28 million in dividends and did not repurchase any of our stock. The lack of share repurchase activity was due to trading limitations resulting from work to close our previously disclosed term loans and to acquire the Wieland assets. We expect our share repurchase program to become active again beginning in the first quarter of 2016. Based on our fourth quarter activity, we ended the year with $775 million of cash and the debt to capital ratio of 30%. As Richard noted at the start of this call, we realized strong new order growth in the fourth quarter as orders were up 13% over the last year to 3,659 homes. Higher orders for the period were driven by 9% increase in absorption paces, as all three buyer groups realized higher prices. It should be noted that we expect absorption paces in the first half of 2016 to be lower as we integrate the Wieland communities with their typical operating model, of higher ASPs, and slower absorption paces relative to Pulte averages. Breaking down orders by buyer group, on a year-over-year basis, our first time buyer business was flat, while move-up an active adult orders increased 35%, 3% respectively. Adjusting for community count, our absorption paces were up 16% from first time buyers, 11% from move-up buyers and 9% for active adult buyers. On a dollars basis, orders for the fourth quarter gained 24% to $1.4 billion, helping to raise the average sales price and backlog to $365,000. It\u2019s important to remember the normal business seasonality and its impact on the mix of closings will typically result in lower delivered ASPs in the first quarter of each year. The company operated out of 620 communities during the fourth quarter, which is up 4% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we currently expect community count growth versus comparable prior year period to be in the range of 8% to 10% in the first two quarters of the year, increasing to 10% to 15% growth in the back half of the year. This will be our largest year-over-year increase in community count since the housing recovery began. Supported by our strong orders in the fourth quarter, we ended 2015 with a backlog of 6,731 homes, valued at $2.5 billion. The growth in our year-end backlog up 15% in units and 26% in dollars compared to last year, gives us great momentum heading into 2016. Now let me turn the call back to Richard. Richard Dugas : Thanks, Bob. As Bob, detailed the company realized meaningful improvement in our operating and financial results for the quarter. Given the strength of our operating metrics and the expansion of our land pipeline, we are in an excellent position to grow earnings in 2016 and beyond. As has been our practice, let me provide a few comments on the market conditions which drove our fourth quarter results. Consistent with our Q4 increases in orders and absorption pace, we experienced generally higher buyer traffic to our communities, a pattern we realized throughout 2015. Further, many of the trends we experienced earlier in 2015 continued through Q4, with stronger demand in the better located and on average closer end communities. Specific to the fourth quarter, buyer demand remain positive up and down the East Coast with notable strength in the Southeast from the Carolinas down to Florida. We\u2019ve talked about positive demand trends in the Southeast for a number of years. It is this trend and our expectations for long-term growth in the Southeast markets, particularly the bigger markets of Atlanta, Charleston, Charlotte and Raleigh, which made the transaction with John Wieland so compelling. Looking to the center of the country, demand conditions remain favorable, although we continue to experience volatility in the performance of underlying markets. Demand in the Midwest showed some positive gains, as we benefitted from an expanded community count in several markets. Our Texas business in Q4 was slowed by having roughly 10% fewer open communities, available for sale versus the prior year. In addition, our Texas numbers were impacted by ongoing demand softness in the higher price communities in Houston, resulting from the prolonged weakness in the energy markets. Given current conditions, we are being very thoughtful about deploying additional capital in the region and we\u2019ll continue to carefully monitor demand throughout the state. The Western third of the country continue to realize excellent demand from Washington through California and through our markets in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico. Overall, we were pleased with our demand conditions developed in the fourth quarter. We have seen a continuation of good traffic and demand trends through the first few weeks of January. So we have every reason to be optimistic heading into the spring selling season. Consistent with our long held expectations for a gradual but sustained recovery, 2015 new home sales of approximately 500,000 units for the country were up 15% over last year. Given the favorable market dynamics of strong job growth, accelerating household formations, supported demographic trends and continued low interest rates, we expect new home sales will continue their slow and steady path higher for the next several years. All that being said, we are well aware of the volatility in the world today. From concerns of our global economic conditions to the swoon in oil prices, to gyrations in the stock market, the day-to-day swings can be violent. The reality is however that we can\u2019t control any of these factors, what we can do is focus on running our business, consistent with the goals we have established and disciplines we\u2019ve demonstrated. This means acquiring well-located communities that we believe can deliver high returns on investment. It also means hedging our bets by using more land options, where possible and focusing in on smaller, shorter duration projects, where we can get our capital back quickly. It also means, not over leveraging the balance sheet and keeping one hand on the lever to slow investment if housing demand begins to change. And finally, it means having the discipline to systematically give excess funds back to shareholders, rather than trying to force investments in the system. We ended 2015 with a strong fourth quarter performance. I\u2019m confident that we can build on these results in 2016 and further capitalize on the excellent market position, I believe PulteGroup maintains today. Our market position has been built by our exceptional group of employees, who work hard every day to build great homes and deliver an unmatched home buying experience to our customers. Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? Jim Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Richard. We\u2019ll open the call for questions. So, that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Sean, if you\u2019ll explain the process, we\u2019ll get started. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Bob Wetenhall : Interesting year, I just wanted to touch on \u2013 you guys have really robust order growth and you also noted 7.5% decline in deliveries in Texas and orders were also soft. Can you give us a view on what you\u2019re seeing in the Texas market and specifically, is it broad based or is it and what\u2019s going on with price points there? Richard Dugas : .: Bob Wetenhall : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. As a follow-up, great execution it seems like you\u2019re on track with deliveries and surmounting some of the labor bottlenecks. Trying to understand the setup for 2016, when we\u2019re thinking about pacing and absorption and your expectations for ASP performance, you said that there is some volatility, but then you look at some of your trends and they seem very strong. How should we be thinking about pricing trends versus cost? You touched on that gross margin 21.5% to 22%. What gives the confidence on the ASP growth you can get there? Thanks and good luck. Richard Dugas : There\u2019s a lot of stuff in that question, Bob. I think in terms of ASP growth, we don\u2019t factor that into our expectations. But we\u2019ve got \u2013 a third of the year in backlog, we\u2019ve got an expectation that we\u2019ve got relatively benign input costs this year. So lumber is trending positively, basically all the other input costs, we see about 2% increase, maybe in our house costs construction that\u2019s largely labor. We\u2019re obviously working through that in all the different markets. So we have visibility into a good part of the year, and at least in terms of input costs, we think that we\u2019re in relatively good shape coming into the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much, guys. Yes, strong quarter and impressive results. Richard Dugas : Thanks, Steve. Stephen Kim : I wanted to ask you a little bit about your break-out of the first time move up in active adult. Just one, two clarifying questions on that. So first of all you said that, in 4Q, I think it was 31% first-time, 40% move-up and then you gave \u2013 some numbers about a third, third, third for 2014. I just want to make sure that was full year 2014 versus fourth quarter of 2014. If you could remind me again, the definition of first-time versus move-up. I mean are you actually just asking them? Is it the first time you\u2019ve ever owned a home or you just sort of \u2013 putting that sort of a demarcation based on price point or what you think a typical first-time buyer would be buying? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Stephen. To the first question is \u2013 that is Q4 data, not full-year. And to the second question, we actually have, what we call targeted consumer groups and so it\u2019s based on the type of product we\u2019re building and the location of it, that tells us who the buyer groups are. And so, the first time designation is just an aggregation of the targeted consumer groups that serve people that are buying, their homes first time as opposed to move up. Stephen Kim : Yes. That\u2019s what I thought. And what\u2019s interesting is that we\u2019ve been sitting\u2026 Richard Dugas : Stephen, just to clarify, I think we had talked about this on a couple of calls. The flagging of those differs somewhat. So there are \u2013 for that millennial buyer that\u2019s closer in typically higher price point, we flagged them Pulte, but they are really first-time buyers. So that\u2019s the primary difference there and then there are certain active adult penetrations that we have historically and will continue to flag Pulte not Del Webb that will get caught in the active adult categorization as opposed to, again being a Pulte flagged. Stephen Kim : Right. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s obviously an important distinction to make because, obviously we\u2019ve been \u2013 will not obviously, but we\u2019ve been seeing a pickup in first-time buying activity that doesn\u2019t seem to really have manifested in entry-level product per se. But \u2013 if that would be consistent with an idea that the guy who let\u2019s say, was a 26, 27-year-old, six years ago, is now older and probably in the market maybe buying a slightly different product than he would have six years ago. I guess my question generally would be, as you lay out your community count growth, as you think about how you\u2019re going to be utilizing the Wieland land with some of your product. And just generally as you position your business in 2016 and 2017, how specifically or discreetly are you targeting a first-time buyer who may be looking to sort of buy a product which historically might have been considered a little bit more of a move-up, the first-time move-up kind of a product? Like, how much are you actually positioning yourself for the emergence of that kind of a buyer into the marketplace an increase in that demand? Richard Dugas : Yes, Steve. This is Richard. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. As an organization, I think we\u2019ve talked about the millennial study that we completed in 2015 which showed what we believe to be significant opportunity for a buyer that is probably in their early to mid 30s who hasn\u2019t owned a home before. So they\u2019re called a first-time buyer, but they\u2019re spending $300,000 to $400,000 on urban townhome product. So, overall our categorization that Bob described, we think more accurately depicts how we\u2019re attempting to serve the business, because those buyers will be captured in that first time category. And we are investing in several of our major cities in that buyer category, and that\u2019s part of the contributing change in ASP that you see in our backlog and in our continued guidance going forward. That\u2019s a part of the Pulte story here. Jim Zeumer : Just to follow on that to add, Steve point, Richard, the average selling price of the first time home is about $264,000, and when you compare that to the historical pricing that we've disclosed for Centex that entry-level business that roughly $200,000, there is a definite difference in the product we are offering, the location we're offering in it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nishu Sood : Thanks and, yes, let me add strong results in the fourth quarter. So congratulations on that. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Thank you. Richard Dugas : Thank you. Nishu Sood : First question I wanted to ask was \u2013 the absorption trend was very nice in the fourth quarter and counter to what we\u2019ve seen generally I think from the industry. 9% absorption growth, now that was on a lower level of community count growth. You\u2019re expecting quite strong community count growth 10% to 15%, I believe you said year-over-year by the end of the year. So typically with new community openings that might dampen absorptions at first. How would that trend then carry through or how would you anticipate that strength carrying through into 2016? Is it going to be diluted by a lot of these new communities are going to be coming on or do you think there is enough momentum that you might be able to sustain that? Richard Dugas : Nishu, this is Richard. Just a couple of comments. To be clear, our 13% sign-up growth was driven by 4% community count growth and 9% improvement in absorption rates on like stores. So we are very pleased with that and before I answer to your question, I just want to point out that we believe that underlying strength and absorption rate is primarily driven by excellent land positions, and we\u2019ve been talking for several years how we believe we\u2019re doing an excellent job of positioning our communities, not just growing for growth sake. Having said that, with regard to our 2016, two things, number one, we\u2019re going to have nice community count growth this year, but it will be a little less in Q1 and Q2 as Bob indicated and then more in Q3 and Q4, although strong, really all four quarters. So that factor, we would expect absorption rates in Q1 to be impacted there. But probably more notably, as we work to integrate the Wieland business, that business is typically a higher price point, slower absorption model, and that as we integrate, it will impact our results, particularly earlier in the year. So just try to make sure that everyone\u2019s expectations factor that into their overall model. So we\u2019re very pleased with the way the trends are playing out for 2016, particularly as it relates to earnings growth overall, but those factors will play in. Nishu Sood : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then second question, on the margin outlook which Bob, I think you laid out pretty well. The capitalized interest that is flowing through the gross margin line, has been an important tailwind for the overall gross margins, that\u2019s certainly the case in 4Q as well as for overall 2015. How do you expect that to trend in 2016? Should we take the percentage of revenues that are represented in 4Q and maybe carry that forward? Could you give us some \u2013 your thoughts on that? Richard Dugas : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. And essentially if you think about it, we\u2019ve got a lag between when we incur cost and expense it. And we\u2019ve had the benefit over the last few years of the debt paydown. That obviously is mitigated in most recent year, if you look at our current full year 2015 our cash interest expense was about $128 million, the expense that we\u2019ve recognize through the income statement was $138 million. So they\u2019re getting closer together. So there will be a much smaller Delta, I think in absolute terms we were $57 million benefit for interest in 2015. That number will be smaller in 2016. And again reflective of the fact that basically where costing off what we\u2019re expensing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Richard Dugas : Good morning, Mike. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Good morning, Mike. Michael Rehaut : First question I wanted to delve in a little bit around the gross margins as well. And appreciate the insights there, and I think if I understand you correctly Bob, you\u2019re saying that the amortized interest for 2016 will trend closer to that $128 million, is that fair? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, we haven\u2019t given any detail. But it\u2019s going to be a much smaller delta than it has been. Michael Rehaut : Right, right. So you\u2019re just trying to get into the components then, of the pre-interest gross margin. And get some of your sense of the puts and takes there 4Q 2015 down about 100 or 90 basis points year-over-year. What were the key drivers of that, and it was also down sequentially I just wanted to get your sense if, labor was a big part, if there was a mix shift, if there was land cost, what were the kind of drivers. And also as we think about 2016, I know you highlighted the Wieland acquisition being about a 70 basis point drag, but what would the other components of that \u2013 of the year-over-year change be? Richard Dugas : Yes, Mike, I think you summarized it well. There is about 70 basis points of detriment that we expect in 2016 from the Wieland acquisition. And then if you look at it, the margin profiles business thinking about it from consumer groups is, as has been the case for years, the most, the highest margin is going to be our active adult. Interestingly when you look at it, the first time business actually enjoys very high margins for two reasons. One, that millennial business that we talked about is a very strong margin business for us. And for the historical Centex business, since we haven\u2019t been investing many of the lots that were running through now are older so they enjoyed strong margins. And then that move up business which is where we\u2019ve done most of our investment over the last three or four years, still enjoying very good margins, but because of the higher land cost and labor costs that we are seeing, is today of the three, although still strong, the lower margin business. And so the mix shift towards that has implications to our composite margin. So 70 basis points from Wieland, mix shift and labor cost, probably the biggest driver of margin otherwise in 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. John Lovallo : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. First question I had is, you gave a lot of detail on the purchase accounting effect from the Wieland acquisition on gross margin. Just curious about how you are expecting kind of SG&A to trend through 2016 given some of the integration costs and then moving past that, once it\u2019s fully integrated, is the $165 million kind of quarterly run rate still a good number or do you think that will actually go up a bit? Richard Dugas : We actually are \u2013 instead of targeting dollars, we are putting trying to get things more aligned with industry and say, okay relative to sales this is what we think. So we think 10%. Obviously the seasonality of the business with lower closings in the first half of the year, higher closings you can and should expect to see be a richer number being higher than 10% in the first couple of quarters and lower much like we did in the fourth quarter of this year. You know, certainly there will be some integration cost associated with Wieland that we would expect overtime to be able to narrow out of the business. But the 10% that we had projected for 2016 is inclusive of that. Richard Dugas : John. This is Richard. And little color also. The 10% guidance Bob provided, when you factor in the construction reversal impact in the 2015 number, you can see that we\u2019re getting substantial leverage in 2016 as we expect to grow. John Lovallo : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, in terms of, maybe can you just give us an update on kind of your spec strategy and how that progressed in the quarter. I think you ended the third quarter with something like 340 finish spec homes and we did you close of the year? Richard Dugas : So finished spec at the end of the year was 471 units which is actually down about 2% from prior year. We started that spec really in the third quarter, so they weren\u2019t finished at the end of year. So you\u2019ll see that come through in our first quarter and second quarter results. But totals spec we talked about, at about 30% of our starts compared to 24% historically. So it\u2019s not a big change, and I think what you can and should expect to do is manage against not letting finished specs get really heavy. Bob O'Shaughnessy: And John and everyone else, just to remind everyone, the reason that we\u2019re increasing our spec production a little bit is to help us with the quarterly cadence of closing, not trying to run quite as tight as we were with pre-sold inventory, and we think that\u2019s going to help us moving forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Alan Ratner : Hi, guys. Good morning and nice quarter. Congrats. Richard Dugas : Thanks, Alan. Alan Ratner : Richard, just on your comment on January, it seems like it\u2019s holding up pretty well. Curious if you\u2019re \u2013 what you\u2019re hearing underground from your active adult buyers given all the stock market volatility? Has there been any \u2013 have you noticed any discernible trends there versus more of the first time or maybe first time move-up product. Because it is a very discretionary buyer I imagine, they\u2019re looking at 401(k) portfolios, as they might be a little bit skittish. So just curious what you\u2019re seeing from that subset of buyers currently? Richard Dugas : Alan, it\u2019s a great question we\u2019ve been paying attention and so far we\u2019ve not seen a change. Alan Ratner : Great, that\u2019s good to hear. Second, on the spec strategy, is there any contemplation within the gross margin guidance next year for specs to represent a greater percentage of your sales? Assuming that is the case, what\u2019s the margin differential are running at currently between your spec and to be built sales? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Certainly, Alan, we factored that into our guidance. As we put together our plans for the year, people knew what they were going to try and start in terms of spec. In terms of actual performance, I would tell you that, recent activity we would tell you that there is a very consistent with historical trend where you are, your dirt sales have the higher margins, we\u2019ve actually seen that people are contracting before framing that the margins hold up and stay consistent, and then we have a couple of 100 basis points of degradation on spec that is finished. So again, I think one of the things we\u2019re really focused on is, let\u2019s not get that finished spec to be a big drag on our margins going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Your line is open. Megan McGrath : Good morning. Richard Dugas : Good morning. Megan McGrath : I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the absorption pace. The nice improvement you had in the quarter, in your commentary you stated that you feel like that driver is primarily because of \u2013 the location of your communities. But I assume that location didn\u2019t change too much quarter-to-quarter. So was there anything specific in the fourth quarter that you think drove that sort of incremental increase? It doesn\u2019t feel like overall new home sales accelerated, in fact, maybe decelerated a little bit. So what specific do you guys changed, let\u2019s say third quarter and fourth quarter, which help that absorption pace in your view? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Megan, there is volatility typically quarter-to-quarter. But I would point out, this is a third or fourth quarter out of the last maybe four or five that we had improved absorption paces. So I believe that\u2019s a factor. I would also say that as our commonly managed floor plans continue to grow as a component of our total, those are very well designed and frankly sell better than the non-commonly managed floor plans, so that\u2019s a factor. But I would continue to highlight that well place land, we\u2019re focused on quality of land, not just quantity of land is the primary driver in my opinion. These will \u2013 maybe what some others in the industry have talked about. Megan McGrath : Okay. Thanks. And I wanted to follow-up on SG&A a little bit too as well. I apologize if I missed part of your answer before. But I know there\u2019s a lot of moving parts here and some of the numbers. So it looks like you\u2019re looking for, if we ex-out the benefits this year, a pretty meaningful year-over-year improvement in SG&A, it looks like about 100 plus basis points. If I have that right. But also looking for a pretty good increase in gross and community count, which I would usually associate with maybe some accelerating SG&A levels. So if you could maybe talk us through your confidence and being able to sort of growth SG&A the slower rate even though you are accelerating your community count growth that would be great, thanks. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Well, it\u2019s interesting, Megan, a big driver of the community count growth is Wieland. And so we opened 200 communities this year and will open some number similar to that next year. So there really isn\u2019t a significant driver there. It\u2019s in terms of community count growth a lot of it is going to be Wieland that we get one big chunk. Richard Dugas : And Megan I think you highlighted \u2013 this is Richard, I think you highlighted it inappropriately. We are anticipating growth in earnings and certainly in volume this year and that provides leverage overall. So we\u2019re not giving any SG&A dollar number but we do expect to leverage our overheads and you are right with your guidance or your commentary if you will on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Mike Dahl : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Why don\u2019t you go back to the margin discussion and I think you addressed it with both Mike Rehaut\u2019s question and Alan, but in terms of some of the mix shift, you\u2019ve got two things going on. You\u2019ve got selling through some of the legacy Centex stuff that was higher margin and transitioning both to move up product and the recent vintage, so just wanted to get your sense of this margin erosion that you\u2019re seeing in 2016. Do you think you are fully run rating what the kind of go-forward mix will be or is there still some to kind of transition out this is still being lifted a little bit by 20% or so of the communities that are still legacy Centex? Any additional detail you could give there? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Well, honestly, we will as the year goes on share what the breakdown is by consumer group. I don\u2019t know that we would want to give quarterly forward guidance that would be community specific Mike. So I think there certainly continues to be a mix shift we\u2019ve invested largely in that move up category. So you will see that continue to play out. Richard Dugas : And Mike this is Richard. I think it\u2019s worth noting that we are extremely pleased with our margin projection for 2016. When you factor in the known headwinds from a new acquisition. We are pretty pleased with how margins are holding up when you combine that with what we expect to be good SG&A leverage and strong growth. Our operating margins we continue to be very pleased with. So yes there are certainly some anticipated core declines from higher input cost that Bob mentioned, but our relative basis we like our margin position a lot. Mike Dahl : Right, I mean, clearly coming from a point of strength. I guess then Richard on that last point on the acquisition, once we get through the \u2013 I mean this is for Bob, once we get to the purchase accounting headwinds which I believe you said 70 basis points drag for, the full year, how should we think about that margin relative to what your legacy business has been producing? I think that was understanding was that may have been a competitive deal so as this once we get through the purchase accounting of 20% margin business or is it really closer to what we\u2019ve seen out of your legacy business the past year or so? Richard Dugas : Yes, Mike, we haven\u2019t given anything beyond 2016. I would tell you, we see opportunities to reduce costs and enhance cases to drive higher returns and that's what we're going to work towards. When we get to 2017, we\u2019ll share what our total margins are and to the extent that, it's relevant we\u2019ll share what the impact of Wieland this season. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Stephen East : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Richard, maybe, the first one. With John Wieland, could you talk a little bit about what drove your decision process here? I know you all are always looking at acquisition this land buys, but more extensively, what was the attraction and how specific was it to John Wieland versus, are you all still actively engaged in looking for more acquisition opportunities that type of thing? Richard Dugas : Steve it\u2019s a great question. Let me first confirm your comment that all acquisitions are looked at through the lands and we\u2019re pleased with the economics of the deal overall and as Bob mentioned the ability to put some Pulte efficiency if you will and to what we saw there. And a part of that, you might have noted in our script, we\u2019re intending to take some Wieland assets and put Pulte product on it to help accelerate absorptions and drive returns. So we feel really great about that. Beyond that, this particular transaction had significant brand value in our mind. For buyers in the Southeast, the John Wieland named commands a premium. And when you factor that into the strategic pricing programs, the focus on option revenue and lot premium revenue, it's a really nice fit into the way we've been driving margins in the business. And we feel like it's a real consistent approach toward driving high returns. So the brand value there is exciting, and candidly, even the value of the Wieland name from an entitlement standpoint, we feel very good about going forward. We want to grow our business in the Southeast, and the Wieland reputation is excited and allowing us to get into some of these core infill locations, millennial locations. So a very, very strong recognized consumer brand in the Southeast that gives us opportunity along with the strong land positions. And then potentially, lastly, I\u2019ll mention the Southeast, Steve, we like vis-a-vis some other markets, we think the Southeast is not overheated. We think the Southeast has got a lot of runway in front of it. And complimentary assets that are not cannibalizing anything else we felt good about. And then just on your last point, we continue to stay actively looking at any transaction come that our way. We\u2019ve been very, very disciplined to make sure the economics work. Stephen East : Okay. Thank you. And then Bob did I hear you right, did you say land spend in 2016 would be $1.6 billion or were you just talking about acquisition side of it? Can you give me a little clarity there? And where you would be, are you reallocating more toward this first time buyer I know not active adult but first time buyer away from the move-up buyer? And just maybe a bit broader on your net debt targets comfortable where your debt is now or do you want to take it lower versus repo that type of thing? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, so to your first question that $1.6 billion that we highlighted was just land acquisition. We will obviously have development spend on top of that. In terms of where we are spending that money, we are still agnostic. Over time we\u2019ve told folks go find the best deals, what that has yielded over the last few years is mostly move-up and that millennial core business that we\u2019ve talked about. I don\u2019t see anything at the moment that tells me it\u2019s going to be anything different in the future, but certainly as and when for instance if that true entry level buyer becomes more robust in terms of paces and the returns make sense we\u2019ve always talked about a willingness and desire to do that. And then to your last point on net debt, 30% to 30.5% at the end of the year. We are very comfortable with that. We have laid out a target range of 30% to 40%. So, yes, very comfortable with our balance sheet position and liquidity. So we\u2019ve got plenty of choice candidly we\u2019ve increased the dividend starting here in the first quarter. We didn\u2019t get to do any share repurchases during the quarter, but you can expect to see us do some of that going forward, and obviously we think we can do that all in the context of the land spend that we outlined. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Will Randow from Citigroup. Your line is open. Will Randow : Hey, good morning guys and congrats on the progress. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Will Richard Dugas : Thanks Will. Will Randow : I just had a question on the mortgage business in regards to how are you thinking about normalizing underwriting standards if possible what levers can pull, and if you could talk about the difficulties and implementing to know before you owe, in terms of more mortgage closings are elongated et cetera. Richard Dugas : So I\u2019ll take the first one, Will, in terms of overall underwriting standards, if they remain fairly consistent. They continue to be tight, and we are governed by the same rules that everyone else is. So no real change in outlook there, may be on the margin it continues to ease just very, very slightly, but overall not much change and then Bob maybe on the TRID rules? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: And with respect to all the rules, again I think we\u2019ve got the best team in the business. They think about change long in advance sort of problematically, systematically. So I don\u2019t see it being an impediment and I know they\u2019ll say, gosh, a lot of hard work behind that, but they\u2019ve got a very clear calendar of the things that are coming at us. Think about strategically so again, I don\u2019t want to make it sound easy, but the TRID, that affected this fourth quarter, it really did not impact our closings and that\u2019s testaments of the work they do that from\u2026 Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS Securities. Your line is open. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Hi, Susan. Richard Dugas : Hi, Susan. Susan Maklari : In terms of the labor side, can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing there? It seems like with the progress you made in closing homes and the talk around your spec strategy, are you seeing any incremental using there? Perhaps some of the contractors are gaining a bit more confidence and what\u2019s going on in the market? Richard Dugas : Susan, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing a real easing. I think we\u2019re getting a little bit better at managing through it by not being quite as tight with our spec inventory change if you will. We give ourselves a few more targets to shoot at each quarter to account for any up and downs that may occur in the market. But labor continues to be tight. There\u2019s not a lot of new labor that\u2019s flowing into the space. So I do think the industry and that\u2019s particularly we are getting a little better at managing through it. But it\u2019s going to be with us for a while. Susan Maklari : Okay. Bob O'Shaughnessy: But the ability to give that to labor markets, the cadence and a consistent view that says \u2013 we\u2019ve got the following work, we\u2019re going to keep our crews busy, we\u2019re not pulled off \u2013 on off the sites. We think we\u2019ll have real benefit in terms of our ability to produce timely. Susan Maklari : Okay. And then, as we look to your, obviously the improvements in the option revenues that we\u2019ve seen and we think 2016, the continuation of the value creation efforts there. Can we see that continue to come up or how should we think about the trends with this? Richard Dugas : Susan, this is Richard. I would never say we\u2019re done in that regard. We certainly taken a lot of price in the last few years, and I would say, the low hanging fruits have been picked overall, but that\u2019s a big focus for us as an organization. And every new job, we open we tend to push, it\u2019s actually been extremely pleasing to us that we\u2019ve been able to continue to make progress quarter-over-quarter there. So, no specific guidance there, clearly there is headwinds from higher cost land and labor pressure as Bob talked about influencing but that helps us to mitigate it. I can\u2019t really give you much more detail though in terms of what we expect there. We\u2019ll have to see how the quarters play out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Jay McCanless : Good morning. First question, what was the can rate in the quarter and what was last year? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Can rate was 18.1 that's about 100 basis points over the last year. Jay McCanless : Okay, and then the second question I had is just with Richard\u2019s commentary earlier about maybe shifting some of the Wieland land to the Pulte nameplate, we had expected an ASP growth of roughly high single-digits for this year as you guys were Wieland in, is that what you\u2019re expecting internally or should we be a little more muted and what you expect for average price growth, if you are going to shift some of that land to lower price Pulte product? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Jay, we\u2019re not given specific guidance on ASP, overall you can kind of see what\u2019s happening in our backlog and project out the next quarter or two in terms of what\u2019s happening with overall ASP. I would point out that Wieland in total will make a modest percentage of the company\u2019s total. So when you factor a portion of that, only a portion of that being Pulte, that specific impact is probably not significant on our overall ASPs. And later in the year can [indiscernible] by the time you actually launch the new product, get the community open, start building houses, that doesn\u2019t happen overnight Jay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is open. Jack Micenko : Hey, good morning. I\u2019m curious about how to think about your lands strategy, obviously the option components correct up to about a third of the inventory now. But then I think in the prepared comments you had said, around 70% of the land spend was for undeveloped. Can we think is that the option percentage is going to continue to creep up or is this a signal that maybe to maintain those margins going to be go out give more on the development side. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes Jack what we really are trying to say is we are really paying attention to managing the risk side of the land component. The fact that we\u2019re having to develop 70% plus is just a factor of the way the land comes to us in the market, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t break those takes into two or three or four takes with options to mitigate risk. And we want to highlight that on Wieland candidly because some of the reports I saw showed people talking about buying eight years, or ten years or 12 years worth of land and we expect to recoup all of our capital in less than four years on that deal. So we\u2019re very, very focused on mitigating risk from that perspective. So in terms of option percentage, I would hope that we can continue to drive that forward the market will take that but agnostic to options or development or not the key is we\u2019re managing risk very differently than we did in the past. Buying 10 or 12 years worth of land at one time is very, very rare event today for the company and will continue to be going forward. Jack Micenko : Okay, so consistent strategy of sort of more efficient balance sheet around the land piece. Richard Dugas : I think that\u2019s right. Jack Micenko : .: Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes and just to clear, it\u2019s really not a margin management exercise, to Richard\u2019s point it\u2019s what comes to us in the market and we underwrite transactions against returns not against margins. So they may drive higher margins, at some point in time, but we are really focused on what the characteristics of the return obviously we have to hold the land for too long that doesn\u2019t seems much good. Jack Micenko : Okay. And then, adding on to the Alan\u2019s earlier question about the marketplace I mean the risk between what, I guess, the equity markets are pricing and around the domestic picture and what companies across many industries are now spring selling season, I mean, and you had some bullish commentary on January. I mean does anything absent Houston is there anything you are seeing a broad footprint that would suggest that there's any kind of creep in [indiscernible] from what\u2019s happening in the broader markets to traffic or demand based? Richard Dugas : Jack, we are watching it very carefully, candidly we haven\u2019t seen the impact yet. And it is interesting to kind of understand that, but I would say it\u2019s really too early for 2016. Now spring selling season kicks off, typically Super Bowl will get a good read on it. But look we can only say we like what we see so far. So we are optimistic, you factor in the combination of low supply in the space in general still five months supply plus or minus, low rates, a jobs picture that I would say is good not great, yes, there is some macro volatility, but so far we like what we are seeing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Mark Weintraub : Thank you, first could you let us know how many active communities are at Wieland? Richard Dugas : Approximately 40. Mark Weintraub : 40, great. And then I think the original expectation was going to be earnings and cash flow accretive in year right from the back. I think today you indicated by next year, is that \u2013 can you just clarify that first? Richard Dugas : Yes, we still believe its earnings and cash flow accretive the year one. It is return accretive year two. That was the comment that we made today. So, yes, we\u2019ve laid out significant cash position and we\u2019ve talked about. We need to start up some of these activities that we think drive higher paces and margin and it will take us some time. So we think it becomes accretive in year two. Mark Weintraub : Great. Then lastly, can you bracket expected land development spend for 2016? Bob O'Shaughnessy: I think you have seen from us over the last two years that it is roughly 50/50. And that is probably not out of the range of reasonable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Gilbert from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ryan Gilbert : Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my questions, most of them have been answered. But just really quickly on the backlog conversion year-over-year improving the gap, in the year-over-year decline. Can you talk, I guess, specifically about the processes or specific steps that you took in the quarter to generate that improvement? And then how you expect that to trend in 2016? I think, just given that, it seems like your growth rate is going to accelerate. Interested in hearing how you think that you can continue to close the gap? Thanks. Richard Dugas : Yes Bob go ahead with that. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: I\u2019m sorry, just the first and the only comment I wanted to make to that is our spec strategy is going to help there. We shifted starting in late Q3 into Q4 building a few more homes on spec, in order to give us an opportunity sort of mitigate some of that decline. Having said that, it\u2019s going to be a gradual process of as Bob indicated on one of the questions earlier, more even production cadence giving the contractors better visibility into what\u2019s coming at them. Overall we think that\u2019s the primary vehicle that we are going to use to help. Clearly, we are paying market rate, Bob indicated that we\u2019re going to expect a little bit of cost inflation this year on the labor side and that\u2019s to be expected. So those are the primary areas, Ryan. Ryan Gilbert : Okay great and you are seeing positive feedback from your sub-contractors on the increased spec levels? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, what they like, we already have quite a few lots in front of them, they like visibility into the production side. So, yes, to the extent that we can build on a more even cadence sprinkling and specking inventory as we have, that\u2019s more predictable for them allowing then to keep the cruise dedicated to our jobs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Alright, thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted to get drill down, I think you kind of addressed it a little bit with Wieland, about 40 communities, which would kind of suggest that at least in the first half for the year will be the bulk of the community count growth, but maybe you are expecting a little bit on an organic basis, is that fair? And then the organic growth ex-Wieland would check in a little bit more in the second half. Is that the right way to think about it? Richard Dugas : I think it is Mike, yes. Michael Rehaut : Okay. And then in terms of the absorption impact of Wieland in the first half, obviously you had a nice acceleration into this most recent quarter, in terms of sales pace. Are you talking about maybe expecting overall company-wide absorption to be down low single-digits or would it be a greater type of number than that? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Mike, we didn\u2019t give any specific commentary on that. We just wanted people to appreciate the fact that absorption rates are going to be slowed by the impact of all these new Wieland communities and their typical model of, say selling one or two a month in each community versus three or four in typical Pulte community. How many \u2013 exactly what that impact is overall on absorption rates is hard to tell. We just wanted people to factor that in. We don\u2019t forecast overall sales as you know. We just wanted you to keep that in mind in your models. Michael Rehaut : Okay, all right great thanks. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open. Buck Horne : Sorry guys, I know the call is going long right now, but I wanted to talk just minute about Del Webb and just the active adult business. I think the absorption rates in active adult seem to be improving, but still lagging some of the other buyer groups. And just wondering if you noticed any performance differentials between say, newer Del Webb communities versus kind of the flagship communities and what else you can do to improve or accelerate active adult absorption? Richard Dugas : That is a good question, this is Richard. The flagship communities if you will, we have really maximized the opportunity there some time ago. So those are kind of our steady run rate basis. The newer Del Webbs that we bring on though, typically are closer to the core center 500 to 1,000 lots, I would say overall better locations and we are really pleased with the results there. So the way I look at it Buck would be as active adult communities cycle over time for us to be concentrating on opportunities that are closer to city core vis-\u00e0-vis the larger kind of big cruise ship Del Webb operations of the past. Those are probably not going to happen again. Having said that, we are pleased with the absorption rates we continue to see. You are right, they are typically lagging the others, but not by much. And we love the financial performance of those communities with strong margins and good returns. Buck Horne : Okay thanks, and on the West Coast, you see in the strength in the west. I mean is there any noticeable differences between maybe California versus some of the other West Coast markets. Any granularity you can give on just the west region will be helpful. Richard Dugas : Buck it was pretty broad based, strong, candidly some of that\u2019s given community count changes, for us overall. But we like our position, our northern California operation, as an example has fantastic land positions, we are continuing to show strength. We\u2019ve got a relatively small business up in Washington, but it\u2019s getting better. And Phoenix is doing quite well for us. So we have a big position in Phoenix and we have an excellent team in Phoenix and they do a great job. We\u2019re driving quite a bit of volume at very good margins there. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Q&A portion of the call. Mr. Zeumer I will turn the call back to you. Jim Zeumer : Thanks John, thanks everybody for your time this morning. We are certainly around all day, if you have any follow-up questions and we look forward to talking to you on our next quarterly call. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Carol, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2016 PulteGroup Inc. Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn today's call over to Mr. Jim Zeumer. James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications : Okay. Thank you, Carol. And let me welcome everyone to today's conference call discussing PulteGroup's first quarter financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Joining me for today's call are Richard Dugas, Chairman and CEO; Ryan Marshall, President; Rob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slide that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We'll also post an audio replay of today's call later this afternoon. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert everyone, all the participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. Some of you may have seen the letter issued yesterday by Bill Pulte over his grandson's performance on CNBC yesterday. As there is nothing new in Bill's letter, we will not be responding to these attacks or otherwise be discussing the Pulte's on this call other than to say that we stand by the completeness and accuracy of our previous disclosures. We run this company for the benefit of all shareholders and we'll continue to do so. I've had the opportunity these past few weeks to speak with many of our largest holders; and it's encouraging to hear your support for our entire leadership team, our board of directors and our value creation strategy. I want to take this opportunity to assure all investors that we are busy running this company and remain squarely focused on continuing to deliver value for you. To that point, we're extremely pleased with the strength of our first quarter results. Consistent with our strategy and our efforts to enhance returns on invested capital, for the past few years we've highlighted strategic pricing, construction productivity and balance sheet efficiency as drivers of our performance. Our financial results over the past few years reflect these drivers, as we realize significant gains in pre-tax profitability despite only modest gains in production volumes. Many of you have seen the graph in our investor presentation, which we've included in today's conference call slides, which was our pre-tax income improving by $1.1 billion over the past five years on just a 12% increase in closings. We have communicated that 2016 would be an inflection year, with increasing volume being delivered through a much more efficient homebuilding operation. The combination of rising unit volumes, increasing average sales prices and the more efficient homebuilding machine can translate into significant earnings growth. Add in the benefit of consistently returning funds to shareholders, and you have a business that can produce high returns for its investors over time. As Bob will detail in a moment, the business is beginning to turn in that direction with sign-ups increasing by 10% to almost 5,700 homes; closing volumes gaining 17% to almost 4,000 closings; average selling prices expanding by 9% to $353,000; and our backlog value climbing 31% to $3.4 billion. These metrics obviously resulted in the strong quarterly performance in the first quarter; but equally important, they position the company to deliver continued growth over the balance of 2016. While our Q1 numbers and our expectations for 2016 point to increasing scale, we have not and will not lose our focus on our primary objective : to run a business that can deliver better returns over the housing cycle and do so with less risk. We have believed since the outset of this housing recovery that it would be more gradual than the V-shaped rebound, typical of most housing cycles. Our thesis is unchanged as we expect an extended recovery will continue to unfold for the next several years supported by improving economy, favorable demographics, years of relative under-building and a supportive mortgage rate environment. Given these dynamics, we've been increasing our investment in the business, but have done so in a disciplined manner by emphasizing smaller projects while expanding our use of options when possible. This has served to shorten our years of land supply helping to mitigate market risk. We've also focused our land investments on closer-in locations where we think demand is more sustainable when the market ultimately takes a breather. We have accepted the trade-off of having to pay a little more for certain positions, but where we can be more confident in their future performance. As evidence of our focus on driving returns and reducing risk relative to prior business practices, consider that our supply of owned lots has fallen from approximately 8.5 years in 2010 to roughly 5.5 years in 2015. Based on our land acquisition discipline, expected sales paces, as we work through some of our longer and older communities, we look for our own supply to continue trending lower in the future. Among the reasons for the decline is that approved land deals over the past five years have averaged roughly 125 controlled lots per community; and this includes 31 new Del Webb projects over that timeframe that have averaged just over 500 controlled lots each. Along with how we manage land, our more disciplined approach to the business extends to the management of the company's entire balance sheet. Bob and his team have done an outstanding job reshaping our balance sheet and giving us the financial strength to run our day-to-day operations and the flexibility to seize on opportunities that develop in the market. As I mentioned earlier, we remain in the camp that this housing recovery has several more years of growth in front of it. At just north of 500,000 new home sales, unit volumes remain 30% below the historic average; and with millennials beginning to buy homes, the leading edge of that demographic is now impacting the market. These factors, along with a growing economy, modest wage inflation and a favorable outlook for jobs, keeps us optimistic about the near and long-term opportunities for PulteGroup. Let me turn over the call to Bob for more details on our quarterly results. Bob? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Richard, and good morning everyone. Consistent with Richard's comments regarding the positive market environment, our first quarter financial results show significant gains in key operating metrics. In addition to delivering strong results in the quarter, our Q1 numbers have the company well-positioned to deliver outstanding full year results as well. Looking at the business, we experienced excellent demand in the first quarter with sign-ups increasing 10% to 5,652 homes. The year-over-year increase in the dollar value of sign-ups is even greater, climbing 24% to $2.1 billion. Breaking down sales by buyer group, unit sign-ups increased 2% among first-time buyers and 37% among move-up buyers, while sales decreased 12% within our active adult communities. The decrease among active adult buyers was due in part to the closeout of several selling efforts. Looking at buyer groups, our absorption pace has increased 8% among first-time buyers and declined 4% and 5% respectively among move-up and active adult buyers. Excluding the impact of the Wieland assets, which typically have slower absorption paces and largely influenced our move-up buyer group, our overall absorption paces were flat. During the quarter, home sale revenues totaled $1.4 billion, which is up 28% over last year. The significant increase in homebuilding revenues was driven by a 17% increase in closings to 3,945 homes, combined with a 9% increase in average sales price to $353,000. The 17% increase in closings resulted from the increased sales activity we've experienced over the last few quarters, coupled with a slight increase in our conversion rate. Our Q1 conversion rate improved over last year, but it is still running below recent multi-year averages. We expect this pattern to continue in Q2 and throughout 2016 as we make gradual progress on conversion rates versus last year. However, elongated construction cycle times will prevent us in the near-term from reaching the levels we realized a few years ago. Looking at the mix of our closings in the first quarter, 29% were first-time buyers, 41% were move-up buyers and 30% were active adult buyers. In Q1 of last year, closings by buyer group were 33% first-time, 34% move-up and 33% active adult. As I noted, our ASP increased 9% in the first quarter reflecting our continuing mix shift towards the move-up business, coupled with increases from all consumer groups, including: an 8% increase to $252,000 for first-time buyers; a 7% increase to $425,000 for move-up buyers; and a 5% increase to $353,000 for active adult buyers. I would like to point out that in addition to the increased selling prices we realized from our Q1 closings, we also realized notably higher sales prices from current sales that resulted in the ASP in our backlog being up 14% over the prior year. These pricing gains are primarily driven by the mix shift to move-up that I mentioned a moment ago, coupled with higher sales prices at Wieland communities. Given our expectations for backlog conversion rates and the longer build times associated with the large Wieland products, the higher backlog ASPs will translate it to higher closing prices on a gradual, but sustained basis over the remaining quarters of 2016 and into 2017. In the first quarter, we reported gross margin of 21.9%, which includes approximately 80 basis points of decrease associated with our acquisition of the Wieland assets. Excluding the impact of the Wieland transaction, margins were consistent with last year. It's worth noting that in addition to the impact of the Wieland purchase, our Q1 margins reflected anticipated higher land, labor and material costs, offset by lower interest charges. Offsetting some of the cost pressure has been our continued success in systematically increasing the amount of option dollars and lot premiums which provide richer margins we realized on each home. In the first quarter, option revenues per closing increased 6% or slightly more than $3,000 over the prior year, while lot premiums increased by 4% or just under $600 per home. Sales discounts in the quarter increased 40 basis points over last year to 2.6% per home, which is consistent with results we've seen over the past several quarters. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to address some questions we've gotten over the past few quarters related to our gross margin. Specifically, over time we've been asked about the influence on our gross margin of longer dated assets that had basis adjustments during the downturn in the market. In response to this, you may recall that we provided an analysis of our Del Webb assets and related margins which we've included in slide 11 in our webcast deck that provided comparisons future of our older, much larger legacy Del Webb communities who are our small newer positions. As you can see on that slide, we enjoy strong margins on that entire book of business with the more recent investments also enjoying strong return. Based on continuing questions from investors around our entire land position, we've prepared some additional analysis which is included in slide 12 of the deck. That slide provides details comparing the margins and income statement impact of our newer and never impaired land with that of our land that was either impaired by us or adjusted through the fair value process as part of the Centex acquisition. Looking at the slide, there are a few things I would like to highlight. First, if you look at the bottom row of the chart, you will see that the legacy lots were actually detrimental to our margins in 2011 through 2013. This is due to the fact that our impairment and fair value processes typically resulted in gross margins in the low teens; and it is only after the benefit of several years of ASP growth that closings on those lots represent a slight benefit to our performance. As with any legacy lots, the margin profile improves over time assuming their home selling prices are increasing even modestly each year. Second, if you look at the second row of the chart, you will see that the legacy lots are decreasing as a percentage of our overall closings. In fact, closings on legacy lots represent 72% of our total closings in 2011, but had fallen to 38% in 2015 and will drop even further in 2016 and the years beyond. And finally, I would highlight that the margins on our unimpaired land purchases remain almost as high as our legacy positions, reflecting the benefit of the investment discipline we instituted as part of value creation. Given the margin profile of our total land portfolio and our ongoing value creation initiatives, we continue to target gross margins in the range of 21.5% to 22% for the full year. Moving past gross margins, our SG&A in the first quarter was $191 million or 13.7% of home sale revenues, compared with $161 million last year or 14.8% of home sale revenues. The increase in our total spend is due primarily the hiring of additional field resources to manage a 41% increase in the number of homes we have under production, plus approximately $4 million of charges associated with the Wieland acquisition. Given that Q1 is a seasonal low point for our deliveries, SG&A spend will certainly decrease as a percentage of revenue over the course of the year, but we also expect that dollar spend will gradually trend lower in subsequent quarters. As such, we expect full year SG&A spend of approximately $730 million or approximately 10% of home sale revenues. Turning to financial services, first quarter pre-tax reported income was $10 million, which compares to $5 million last year. The increase is due primarily to the higher closing volumes generated through our homebuilding operations. Our capture rate for the period was 81%, compared with 82% last year. Looking at our income taxes, our first quarter expense of $35 million represents an effective tax rate of 29.5%, which is below our guidance of 38%. During the quarter, the company realized approximately $10 million of net favorable adjustments related to the settlement of certain state tax matters. Going forward, we expect our normalized rate for the remaining quarters in 2016 to be consistent with our previous guidance of 38%. Finishing up on the income statement, our Q1 net income was $83 million or $0.24 per share, compared with prior year net income of $55 million or $0.15 per share. $83 million is our highest reported first quarter net income in a decade providing further confirmation that we've gotten off to a very good start to the year. Looking at our controlled lot positions, we approved approximately 7,000 lots for purchase in the quarter, which represents an average of roughly 160 lots per community approved. We continue to focus on smaller, faster turning communities. However, given that most of the land positions we're putting under control are raw, we still estimate it will take 12 months to 18 months before a community will typically come online. At quarter-end we had approximately 146,000 lots under control, of which of 30% were controlled via option. During the quarter, we spent $262 million on land acquisitions, which does include our purchase of the Wieland assets. Based on our Q1 land acquisition spend, we're on track with our prior guidance of investing approximately $1.2 billion, excluding Wieland, from land acquisitions in 2016. This estimate assumes we can continue to identify projects that meet our disciplined underwriting guidelines and return thresholds. Consistent with our value creation priorities, we continue to return funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. After curtailing stock repurchases in Q4 of 2015 because of activities surrounding the Wieland transaction, we reinstated our buyback programs and look to be a consistent and systematic participant in the market for our shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares for $50 million or $16.36 per share. We ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash, which includes funds raised through our February senior note offering. We plan to use approximately $465 million of our cash to retire bonds which would mature in May of this year. Our debt-to-total capital ratio at quarter-end was 39%, compared with 30% at the end of 2015. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the May bond repayment, our debt-to-capital ratio drops to 35%. For the quarter, we operated from 709 communities, which is up 16% from the same period last year. The increase is higher than our guidance range of 8% to 10%, but reflects a slower closeout rate for our existing communities as opposed to an acceleration in new store openings. As such, we expect the year-over-year change in community count will come back in line with our previous guidance as we move through the year. And finally, our quarter-end backlog of 8,755 homes is valued at $3.4 billion, which represent increases of 15% and 31% respectively over the prior year. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall for some additional comments. Ryan R. Marshall - President: Thanks, Bob, and good morning. As both Richard and Bob have mentioned this morning, our financial results demonstrate that 2016 is shaping up to be an inflection point for the company. Reflective of actions we've taken over the past several years, we've transitioned the business to deliver more growth, but without introducing excess risk. For the past five-plus years, we've been methodically altering our risk profile by selling off unproductive land parcels and moving through long-lived assets that have been a drag on the balance sheet. Over the same period, we've reinvested in shorter duration, high-margin communities that have generated high returns and driven the financial gains over the past few years. Having been in the field for over a decade and now part of the senior leadership team for the past few years, I fully appreciate the change we've undergone in pursuing the value creation strategy and the benefits we've captured. As we transition to responsible growth, my focus is on ensuring we capture additional operating efficiencies while continuing our disciplined investment process. This means delivering more volume in a profitable, responsible and risk-adjusted way, and avoiding the trap of chasing growth for growth sake. During my field visits, I have and will continue to drive on the point that we're running a business designed to deliver through-cycle returns; and this demand is efficiently growing pre-tax income while intelligently investing in the business. Now looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 7,909 homes under construction at the end of the quarter, of which 27% were spec. Consistent with our previous guidance, we purposely increased spec production heading into the spring selling season to help manage and smooth our overall production cadence. With spec sales tracking to plan and finished specs continuing to average well below one per community, we're right where we wanted to be during this busy time of the spring selling season. After several months of strong spec starts and now having a large and growing backlog of sold homes, we've already started reducing the number of specs we put into production. Looking at demand conditions for the quarter, we are very pleased with activity in the marketplace these past few months. As you might expect, with the 10% increase in sign-ups for the period, we generally saw positive traffic and demand conditions across the country during the quarter; and I would add that this trend has continued into the first few weeks of April. In summary, the feedback I've received from our operators during my recent market visits is consistent with what we see in the data. The selling season has gotten off to a very good start. Taking this down to a regional level, on the East Coast overall demand was solid in the quarter and gotten better as you move from North to South. Consistent with the trend over the last several quarters, we continue to see stronger demand in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida. We are excited about the long-term opportunities we see in the South, particularly in the Southeast, given the migration trends, buyer preferences and land availability. It is one of the reasons why we were interested in the Wieland assets. Looking at the middle third of the country, we saw broad-based improvement in demand through the Midwest. With sign-ups climbing over 30% for the quarter, winter weather conditions were a little easier at the start of this year compared with 2015, but we are optimistic that the higher sign-ups for the quarter reflect a more fundamental improvement in demand. Dropping down into Texas, on a year-over-year basis, sign-ups were essentially flat as exceptional strength in Dallas was offset by softer demand in Houston and San Antonio. Houston demand improved as we move through the quarter and the market has performed better than I think many were expecting. And finally, looking out to our Western markets, we continue to experience good demand, particularly in some of our bigger markets including Northern California, Phoenix and Las Vegas. We have some new communities open in Las Vegas; and it is great to see the market responding favorably to these new locations. Given the differences and market dynamics that can exist at the local level, it can be tough to generalize, but we would say that demand continues to improve and that communities located closer to the city center fair better in terms of sales prices and paces. The inventory of homes available for sale remains tight in most of our markets; and at least on the new home side it will likely remain that way for a while given the limited supply of finished lots available. I've already met some of you at conferences earlier this year, and I look forward to meeting more of you as the year progresses. Let me turn the call back to Richard. Richard? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Ryan. In summary, we had an excellent quarter. And given our strong backlog and growing production pipeline are well-positioned to have an excellent year. The work we've done since value creation began in 2011 has responsibly positioned PulteGroup to be a through-cycle performer, which is why we look forward to the future with optimism. I want to close by thanking our terrific PulteGroup employees who despite the public distractions these past few weeks have and continue to do a fantastic job staying focused and delivering for our customers. You're the best team in the business and I could not be more proud to work side-by-side with you. Let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications : Hey. Thanks, Richard. We'll open the call for questions, so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Carol, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started. Operator : Thank you. Your first question this morning comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Your line is open. Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Susan. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Susan. Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : I just wanted to start off by talking a little bit about the conversion rate. You clearly did see some improvement in the quarter there, but it sounds like there's still some more that we could see coming through as we move through the year. Can you talk a little bit about sort of what were the puts and takes that allowed you to get the incremental move-up and yet what's still sort of holding you back? And how should we think about the trends for the year? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We've talked about that as something we're striving to do. We still have a challenging entitlement process. And so, as we go through the year it's our expectation we'll continue to see improvement relative to last year, but that we won't get back to historical averages, at least not during 2016. Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then I also wondered if you could just give an update on the Wieland acquisition. Clearly, that's starting to come together, but just a bit more detail on how that's progressing? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Susan. It's Richard. The Wieland acquisition is progressing well. The teams are moving through the integration process as expected. We had, what, about two-and-a-half months in the quarter of total activity from the brand, but it's going well. We have an excellent team focused on integration; and we're pleased with the way it's going so far. So it's early yet, but so far so good. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone; and nice quarter. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mike. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mike. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question I had was just going back to the order trends and by component, community count and sales pace. I believe you said that community count was better than expected due to lower closeout rates during the quarter, but you expect 2Q to get back to original guidance. So just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right that the original was for the first half community count to be up 8% to 10% versus 4Q end? And also from a absorption standpoint roughly flat year-over-year, and I believe you had expected Wieland to maybe have a little bit of a negative impact and a slight overall decline in absorption. If being flat versus that original slight decline was also related to the slower closeout of the older communities, then could we expect that original expectation to reassert itself in the second quarter as well? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : A lot there, Mike. I think to answer your first question, yes, your memory is correct. So we were 8% to 10% Q2 year-over-year and then 10% to 15% year-over-year in the back half of the year. And what we're saying is we think we'll get back to that range of growth period-over-period. As to absorption paces, we did say coming into the year that Wieland would likely have an impact on our absorption paces, because it moves a little bit slower than our traditional Pulte business; and in fact that's what we saw. So we highlighted that you had an 8% increase in first-time and 4% and 5% decreases in move-up and active adult. And if you take Wieland out \u2013 and that's a net 5% down, 8.4% to 8.0% in terms of absorption paces \u2013 if you take Wieland out, we go up to 8.4%. So essentially we're flat ex the Wieland business. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Also on the gross margins, a little bit better than we were looking for, but you reiterated your full year outlook on a net basis. So just wanted to make sure that we're thinking about it the right way in terms of the interest amortization, how should we think about that for the year, as well as any moving parts that were maybe better than expected pre-interest? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think we've given guidance, 21.5% to 22%. We're reiterating that. Coming into the year we had said Wieland would influence our margins by about 70 basis points for the year. We still think that's a pretty good number. We had given quarterly estimates on that; and it was 100 basis points in the first quarter, 70 basis points in the second, 50 basis points in the third and fourth. And we were a little bit less impactful, in the first quarter it was only 80 basis points, but we think through the year that it's still about 70 basis points. So coming into the year, we said, look, we've got higher land and labor construction costs and that will be offset by interest increases. That's exactly what we saw in the first quarter. I think you can expect to continue to see that through the balance of 2016; again, within that annual range of 21.5% to 22%. Obviously the financing we did here in the first quarter took our leverage up, took our interest spend up. So for the first time in a long time, our cash spend is a little bit higher than our interest expense. That won't influence 2016. It will have some influence on 2017 and beyond. But I guess the only thing I'd point out to that end is, paying down the debt that we'll do in the second quarter, there's a net add of about $500 million year-over-year. That's roughly 5%, 5.5%. So it's not a huge incremental interest increase as we go forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. The first question is on order pricing; pretty strong here. I was wondering if you could give us a breakout of how much of that was mix and how much of that was organic price increases? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : John, this is Richard. Most of it was mix. We certainly got some price in the quarter. Bob indicated that we had improvements in both option impact as well as lot premium impact. So certainly some of it was price, but the majority of it was mix, reflective of the investments that we made over the past few years. We've been quite clear that the majority of our investments have gone to that move-up category. So that was the majority of it. There was also a little impact from the Wieland backlog coming in. So you see the backlog ASPs expanding pretty dramatically; and that's primarily due to mix with a little bit of Wieland and some price. John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up I think you guys indicated that the Houston market seemed to improve somewhat throughout the quarter. Was there a particular price point where you saw most of that improvement? Ryan R. Marshall - President: Hey, John. It's Ryan. We actually saw the Houston market recover probably better than expected the further that we moved through the quarter. The lower price points certainly performed better and we saw a little bit of slowness in the higher end price points in Houston. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open. Trey Morrish - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is actually Trey on for Steve. So my first question is on your gross margin in the quarter you definitely did a lot better than we were looking for, with you almost reaching 22%. And we're wondering how with your year-end margin guidance remaining the 21.5% to 22% range, how you're expecting a quarterly cadence to develop when normally we'd expect lowest gross margin in the first quarter and the highest gross margin at the end of the year? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Trey, this is Richard. I'll answer that. We're not providing quarterly margin guidance. We're very pleased with our margins. I think the takeaway is that we continue to run the business focused on high returns, but margins are holding up; and we're pleased to reiterate the guidance that we started the year with. Trey Morrish - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So you would expect obviously the 21.5% to 22%, everything to stay within that range for the year though? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That are expectation, yes. Trey Morrish - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, got it. And then secondly, what was your land development spend in the quarter? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It was about a little over $300 million. So pretty consistent with historic spend patterns where we've been spending roughly dollar for dollar land acq and land development. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Matt A. Bouley - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. This is actually Matthew Bouley on for Mike. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask about the legacy land beyond what you're planning to deliver. So just how are you thinking about bringing specifically your inactive legacy land back? Have you seen signs that demand is pushing out a bit into outer locations? And then how should we think about potential margin impacts from that? For example, would there be any more interest capitalized into the older land? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : To the final question, the answer is no. The answer is, it doesn't get capitalized into older positions that way. But I guess the way I would answer that is we don't have a tremendous amount of what I would characterize as outer ring assets. If you think back, we certainly have a large lot position associated with some of the larger, older Del Webb positions. It's that slide 11 in the deck. And we've talked about that for years that it will just take us time to work through that. Good news is strong margins on that business, good return on incremental investment. We own the land (34:52) now we're just development dollars, sticks and bricks. So we do okay on that. It's also worth mentioning that over the last, gosh, I guess it's five years now, we've been pretty active in selling some of those older, what I would characterize as, challenged assets. So if you think about it, over the last four years or five years, it's certainly more than $400 million probably of land sales that moved a lot of those, again what I'd characterize as, challenged assets. So our book today doesn't have a lot of that. Matt A. Bouley - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, got it. Thank you. And then secondly, just on SG&A, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the work force investments that you mentioned? So just geographies and which types of labor were you targeting? Thank you. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Matthew, this is Richard. Primarily that's field resources to get home some production field managers or superintendents that manage our business. We had a very large increase in homes under production, 41%; and that takes incremental people to help manage the process. So most of it was related to construction resources to get those homes into production for deliveries later this year. And geography agnostic. We've had a fairly significant ramp-up in land spend in the last few years. And as we've indicated, 2016 would be a pivot year for volume for the company and you're beginning to see that come through the system; and that's what those dollars are for. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Thank you. Good morning, and congrats on the solid quarter. I'm not sure... Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Ivy. Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates: ...if Deb Still is in the room or not, but I was hoping for an update on Pulte Mortgage with respect to trends related to the (36:50) headwinds, because we're hearing concerns about closings that might be impacted in future quarters because of uncertainty around the rules, especially in the secondary market, as opposed to those loans being sold directed to Fannie/Freddie they don't seem to be as problematic or accepting it and not pushing back. So any concern about 2Q and 3Q closings? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, Deb's not here, but I'll take that one, Ivy. We do sell direct. And so I would tell you we are not seeing that as an impediment to our closing process. More broadly for the market, I can't comment on. Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Got it. All right. Great. And, Bob, just in terms of my follow-up, if you can give us an update on some of the higher price points around the market, if you're seeing any change in activity? We've heard depending on the city obviously high-end is defined differently. So I don't know if you see that, for example, in Atlanta about $600,000 or $700,000, are you seeing changes in absorption paces for that higher-end price point? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ivy, this is Richard. I'll take that one. We are not. We're seeing good activity in the higher price points around the system. Again, we have a modest number of really high price point homes, $600,000, $700,000, $800,000, relative to our ASPs in the mid-to-high $300,000s overall, but we're seeing good demand. And most of that for us is in Northern California, some in D.C., excuse me, some of the higher-priced markets in general. But overall, so far so good in that area. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Przybylski from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Paul Przybylski - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Thank you. This is Paul Przybylski on for Stephen East. First, you mentioned the Del Webb orders were down on community closeouts. I was wondering if you had heard anything from the field though about equity market volatility negatively impacting that buyer? Ryan R. Marshall - President: Hey, Paul. This is Ryan. Yeah, we've seen a little bit of traffic slowdown at our Del Webb communities, which we think is directly related to the market volatility. We saw that lessen as we move through the quarter and some of the market volatility started to come back into normal ranges. We're quite pleased with what we're seeing out of our Del Webb markets right now. Paul Przybylski - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Okay. And then you spoke to Houston improving through the quarter, but now Houston has its own weather problem. What kind of impact do you think that would have on 2Q conversion rates? And then how long after we have a significant weather event like that does it take demand to rebound? Ryan R. Marshall - President: Yeah. Great question. Houston's obviously dealing with some weather challenges right now. We haven't gotten a full assessment of the extent of the damage. Many of the communities are still underwater and having to struggle getting out of their homes. We don't expect it to have much of an impact at all on our Q2, probably it's fairly a small impact as we move into Q3. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And, Paul, just to add to that, remember, Houston is roughly 4% or 5% of our total company volume. So when you add it collectively, obviously we're paying attention to it, but we're not too concerned about it. And we do still have seven months, eight months to watch that for the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is open. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey. Good morning, everybody. First question, looking at some of the regions, Northeast down a bit more than last year, strong Midwest, strong Southeast. Relative to absorption, is it okay to think that that's generally sort of moving in line with the community count or is there any more pronounced demand swing in any of those sort of outside move regions in the quarter from an order perspective? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Jack, we're seeing our Western markets do quite well. We think this is reflective of some of the places where the local economies are strong, as well as where we have great investment. We've also seen the Midwest perform very well year-over-year. So those are the two spots that I would highlight. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then a follow-up on the G&A guidance on the dollar. I think, Richard, you had said a lot of that is field-type labor. Is the significant improvement or implied improvement in the G&A ratio into the end of the year, is that more a function of sort of flexing the overhead spend around the construction and then maybe bringing that back down, or is it all conversion rate improvement or is it sort of a mix? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'll speak to the first part of that and maybe ask Bob to comment a little bit more. From an overall absorption perspective, we're definitely going to get a conversion rate improvement as we go through the year, as you might expect, with all the homes in production that will be flowing through. There is also, however, a little bit of a total dollar improvement. Maybe Bob can speak to that. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We've talked about this in the past, and for the most part our dollar spend is relatively fixed. We don't run sales commissions through SG&A, and so we have other than production level and footprint expansion. So if we're opening a bunch of new communities, there are costs associated with that. So as we look at the balance of the year, the guidance would imply another $540 million of spend, which translates to about $180 million a quarter; and I would suggest that's kind of how we'll spend it. It's not going to be largely variable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Will Randow from Citigroup. Your line is open. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Will. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Will. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): In terms of going back to \u2013 this was asked a couple of different ways \u2013 variances in your gross margin expectations. Can you talk about how your expectations for lumber inflation, as well as labor inflation from, again, a gross margin expectation have moved since you reported your last quarter? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We had said coming into the year that with a relatively benign commodity market, but a relatively tight labor market that we saw our construction costs up about 2%; and that was largely labor and we still see that. We've got pretty good visibility into six months of costs. And so, in terms of our backlog, we have, like I said, pretty good visibility into what our cost structure is going to be on that. So we haven't seen that move materially since we last talked. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And, Will, just to be clear, I'm not sure I heard you correct at the end of your question there, but we are not changing our gross margin expectations. We're reiterating them in the same range. So just to be clear. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Understood. Thank you. And then just want to follow-up in terms of backlog conversion. What's your confidence level going into kind of the peak production season for closings in the second quarter and third quarter that we don't have any more, I'll call it, disruption? I know you guys have ramped up spec count. Can you talk about some other preventive actions you may have taken to improve that confidence level? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Will, this is Richard. I'll take that. Certainly, spec count is definitely helpful to us. We've also paid a lot of attention to the overall labor market in total when we saw some of the disruption last year, and have done our best to add incremental vendors where we could overall. So we're pleased with the progress we've made. And just to be clear, Bob mentioned this earlier on the answer to a question, we expect improvement relative to prior year conversion rates, but not back to old historical levels; and that's primarily due to the fact that our cycle times are extended. We indicated on one of our calls last year that they were up eight days or nine days in total, and we're still seeing that. So we've improved our processes overall, but we're not expecting to get back to historical ranges even though we will be improving relative to prior year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Ken. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Ken. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Slide 12, very interesting. I have two questions. Related to this slide, what can we infer from the outlook I guess, or how do you guys kind of balance where you think \u2013 if you're talking about gross margins, which we can see on the non-adjusted side, having peaked in 2014. Could you kind of talk about the deltas that are associated with each of those pre-interest? I mean, do you have higher interest expense in the legacy or is there any accounting nuances that we should be familiar with there if we think about the mix aging through time as you deplete those legacy land positions? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Ken, fair question. The answer is no. Our interest gets applied across our entire production portfolio. And so, when we manage the business, these are the numbers we're managing against. So this is sort of book value, historical cost versus selling price for each. So as you look at this, interest doesn't really influence it. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And, Ken, this is Richard. I would just add I think what you should take away is that the investments we've made the past four or five years are at really nice margins. We're very pleased with that. And that even though it will be declining as a percentage of total production, the legacy lots will continue to be a tailwind for margins going forward. Those are the two key points we're trying to drive here. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Understood; and I think you guys did very well by presenting it this way. My next question is a bit more regional, specifically about California. It's not the biggest market for you guys, but could you talk about the trends you're seeing in San Francisco given perhaps slowdowns we're seeing in VC funding and how that might impact kind of your points that you have up in San Francisco? And if you could, describe a rate of foreign buyers, if that's an item that you have been tracking in California or Seattle in general? Thank you very much. Ryan R. Marshall - President: Hey, Ken. This is Ryan. We've actually seen exceptional strength in our Northern California market, and it's really reflective of the wonderful investments that we've made. Really focused on the core employment areas in the East and South Bay. We've got a lot of infill opportunities in infill communities that we've invested in; and we're seeing excellent demand that is being driven by what's been a strong labor market, as well as very tight supply. So we're obviously watching some of the things that are going on in the technology sector, but we've stayed away from some of the outer locations. As you move further away from the Bay Area, we think those are some of the areas that will obviously be hit first if the labor market there tightens. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Eisen - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. This is actually Michael Eisen on for Bob this morning. I just had a quick question about the pace of ASP growth and your order growth. They both were very strong. Wondering how much of this is attributable to community count shift and how much is price appreciation? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Mike, this is Richard. The majority of it is the continued mix shift that we've had in the business. ASPs are rising strongly because of our investments over the past couple of years with mix shift. We are also getting some benefit out of the Wieland business integrating into our backlog which raises our ASP some. But the vast majority of it's from our core business continuing to move higher. So, as you note, our ASP in backlog is over $380,000 now. And as Bob indicated, we'll be delivering into that number slowly and steadily through this year and into next. Michael Eisen - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And then when you guys talk about the delayed closure of some community counts, are any of these at significantly higher or lower price points that would cause fluctuation quarter-over-quarter as we look forward into the rest of the year as those close out? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. This is Richard again. No, and this is one of the reasons we don't love community count as a metric. We've explained this before. You might have a handful of legacy communities that had one or two sales that drifted from Q4 into Q1, and those get counted as a new \u2013 or excuse me, a community in our convention. So no, there's no significant impact on either ASPs or anything else related to the few closeout communities that we had some activity in, in Q1. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Kim from Wellington Management. Your line is open. Gabriel A. Kim - Wellington Management Co. LLP: Morning. Excellent results. Thank you. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Gabe. Gabriel A. Kim - Wellington Management Co. LLP: Thank you. My question is on slide number 11, and this is a slide that we've looked at for a couple of quarters now; legacy Del Webb versus new active adult investments. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Go ahead, Gabe. Gabriel A. Kim - Wellington Management Co. LLP: Okay, super. So what I'm looking at here \u2013 so I appreciate the purpose of the slide. On the left-hand side we have low older Del Webb and then on the right-hand side we have newer Del Webb; and newer is always better than older. So the gross margin is 10% higher. And then when you sort of look at the bottom of the table, it says estimated remaining lot supply, 12 years for the older; estimated remaining lot supply for the newer is five years. If we were to translate this slide to a dollars basis, how would that 12 years versus five years look, do you think? The turnover, not in relation to the units, but the dollars of inventory. How does it look? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm not sure I'm following you, Gabe. Are you talking about the total balance sheet investment on the left side versus the right, Gabe? Gabriel A. Kim - Wellington Management Co. LLP: Yes. Thank you. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't know if we have that at the tip of our tongue. We could certainly work on that and potentially get back to you. I think it's... Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Gabe, it's complicated because you've got options lots in here versus owned lots. So are you talking about committed capital, spent capital, in particular the newer Del Webbs. For the older ones typically we own them, but for the newer ones we've tried to structure them with option takedowns. So let us give that some thought. And maybe when we present this either at the next investor conference or next quarter, we'll try and get some color in there for you. Gabriel A. Kim - Wellington Management Co. LLP: Okay. But the question really is the dollars because we've heavily written down the stuff on the left; and the stuff on the right, maybe not so much. But the turnover expressed not in years, but in dollars. That's kind of what I'm interested in getting a sense for. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Gabe, I think it's fair to say that the dollars associated are not gigantic for the company based on the total investment. And to your point the write-downs, which is reflective on the following slide, slide 12, which shows the sort of legacy lots, which many of these Del Webb lots would be included in that as a margin tailwind going forward. Gabriel A. Kim - Wellington Management Co. LLP: Okay. It'd be good to see that number. Nice numbers. Thank you. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I realize you guys are hesitant and restricted in what you want to say about the Pulte family's recent letter, so I'm going to be careful how I word this. But if the board were to identify a CEO candidate before next year, could we expect to see a transition before the expected or the previously announced retirement date for Richard? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Buck, this is Richard. The board plans to undertake a thorough review, as we talked about in our public disclosures. Sometimes CEO searches can be lengthy. So it's certainly expected that I'm going to fill out my announced term through May of 2017, but we'll keep you focused as that develops. And I think the board's been real clear that they're going to take a deliberate process here, and they intend to follow it. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And I understand the current situation is a little complicated, but would the board seek to consult with the Pulte family on the next potential CEO candidate? And also are there any allowances that are in the new SG&A guidance related to your expected retirement? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : There's nothing in our SG&A guidance related to expected retirement, I can tell you that. And I'll just reiterate that the board has a special committee of independent directors that they formed to look for my successor. And I just want to ensure every investor until the day I walk out of here, our entire team is focused on continuing to successfully execute value creation. And our board has a really good process underway; and you can expect that will be revealed over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. And I really do appreciate the slide 12, it's helpful and interesting. Was hoping to get a sense of how many of your total existing lots now would be legacy lots? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, looking at the portfolio, it's relatively modest outside of Del Webb. And in the Del Webb position, you can see there's 36,000 lots. If you look at slide 11, there's 36,000 lots in that book that we would characterize as those legacy assets. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Not wanting to get too technical, but I noticed that was prior to 2012. This is somewhat different date frames, but... Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It is. But they're pretty close to the same in that context. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Okay, great. And I think you answered this question when you said that the legacy lots would continue to be a tailwind. But the legacy lots that have been sold more recently, would they be meaningfully different than the remaining lots that you would have as legacy lots? Have you been selling much better legacy lots as opposed to those that are less well-positioned? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but we're not cherrypicking which lots to sell. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And, Mark, this is Richard. To add to something Bob said earlier, there's not a big block of legacy lots that are sitting and waiting to be sold off. There are a lot of positions that are primarily Del Webb that have eight years, 10 years, 12 years of life left that will be worked through at a reasonable pace over the next eight years, 10 years, 12 years that will continue to impact in a positive way, as you can see, margins going forward. But there's not going to be a big slog (57:15) coming through at any one time. To Bob's point, we've been very deliberate with regard to the way we're managing those assets; and we've done a nice job with. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. There's been some pretty good discussion already about your delivery schedules and what you're doing to manage those and the additional field personnel and how we should expect improvement. I wanted to dig in a little bit to the labor market itself, the subcontractor pool and what you're seeing out there. Are those issues gradually easing over time? Are pay scales rising? And is that helping to solve a problem? Do you see new sources of labor coming into the subcontractor pool? What are you seeing out there? It doesn't seem to be showing up in the macro data in terms of higher wage rates. So what are you seeing out there and how do you expect that to trend over the course of the year? Ryan R. Marshall - President: Nishu, this is Ryan. We've seen stability in the labor market. Certainly, labor supply is tight. It has been, and we expect that it will continue to be tight as we move through the year. We have not seen a huge influx of new labor come into the industry. And we're going to continue to run our business much like we have in the past; and we don't expect a significant change. So it's going to be stable. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And in terms of its impact on your cost structure, obviously there were some pressures last year for you folks and I think for a number of builders. How has that trended more recently and has that cost profile come back in line? And are you able to recover any cost increases through the pace of home price appreciation? Ryan R. Marshall - President: Well, certainly we've seen labor rates up. We've talked about that. We've seen input costs, commodity costs generally down or favorable; not necessarily down, but favorable, so not increasing. And obviously we are seeking to maximize price across the buying spectrum in all cases. And so, we have seen price appreciation. I would suggest it was certainly enough to cover the incremental input costs. Operator : And our final question today comes from the line of Alex Barr\u00f3n from Housing Research Center. Your line is open. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC : Yeah. Thank you. Sorry if I missed it, but what was the interest rate on the new debt you guys issued? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We did two tranches, a five-year piece and a 10-year piece. And the 10-year piece was 5.5%, but through five-year it was 4.25%. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC : Okay. Yeah. I think that's all I have. Thanks. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Alex. Operator : And I will now turn the call back over to the presenters for any concluding remarks. James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications : Great. Thank you, Carol. Thanks, everybody, for your time today. We're certainly available if you've got any follow-up questions; and we'll look forward to speaking with you on the next call. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference. James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications : Great. Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone participating on today's call. I want to welcome you to PulteGroup's conference call to discuss our second quarter financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Joining me for today's call are Richard Dugas, Chairman and CEO; Ryan Marshall, President; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Vice President-Finance and Controller. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompany today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We'll also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Over the five plus years, we have been operating under our Value Creation strategy. The company has moved through several different stages as our operating and financial results progressed. When we started back in 2011, our initial focus was on fixing our fundamental business performance along with strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing overall returns on invested capital. Having made significant progress toward achieving these initial operating and financial objectives, in 2013, we were in a position to begin materially increasing investment in the business. Our land acquisition spend on an annual basis the last few years doubled from $600 million or 11% of revenue in 2013 to $1.2 billion or 21% of revenue in 2015. While the dollars grew, our underlying discipline has not wavered. We have continued to invest in higher- returning, shorter-duration projects that are closer to city centers, allowing the company to maintain high margins and returns through this timeframe. As we have talked about on recent calls, 2016 is the year this increased investment begins to pay off as we have now reached an inflection point toward higher growth in the business. The earnings release we issued this morning demonstrates this point as our second quarter results show another quarter of strong year-over-year growth across a variety of important business metrics including sign-ups which increased 11% in units and 21% in value, closings which increased by 27%, revenues which increased 41% to $1.8 billion, earnings per share which gained 21% on a reported basis and was significantly higher when you adjust for the charges and benefits in the respective reporting periods and with our backlog value up 21% to $3.7 billion, our highest since 2007, we are in an excellent position to realize further growth over the remainder of 2016. It is clear that after three years of increased investment in the business, we are driving meaningful growth across the operations. While our increased land investments should bring growth for several years to come, we have not forgotten that homebuilding is a cyclical business which is why we are already planning for the future. Value Creation was designed over five years ago to help maximize shareholder value through an entire housing cycle. With this in mind, in addition to announcing our strong second quarter financial results, this morning's earnings release highlighted additional actions we are now taking as we move through the housing cycle. After four years during which our investment in new land grew significantly, we plan to slow the rate of growth in our new investment in 2017 and beyond. With 143,000 lots currently under control, we maintain a very strong land pipeline on which to operate over the next few years. Our stated capital allocation priorities of first investing in high-returning land and then returning excess funds to shareholders have not changed. As such, given a moderated level of land spend in future years, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to allow us to increase our share repurchase activities. As stated in the release, our board has approved an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $1.5 billion. As also stated, we expect to utilize that authority over the next 18 months through repurchases of $250 million in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and an additional $1 billion in 2017. Along with looking to create value through our allocation of capital over time, we are also taking action to create value through maximizing efficiencies within our operations. Over the past several years, we have worked extremely hard to raise our operating margin from the bottom quartile of the homebuilding peers to among the industry leaders. We want to maintain and as possible enhance our relative position. To help realize this objective, we plan to lower our SG&A spend from an estimated 10% of revenues in 2016 to 9% of revenues or lower in 2017. While we expect to realize a portion of this leverage benefit from increased revenues, we are also working to take unnecessary overhead out of the business. The fact is that after five years, many of the core homebuilding disciplines put in place at the outset of Value Creation are now part of the company's standard operating practices and are embedded in our muscle memory. As such, there are opportunities to remove some of these costs. As I wrap up my initial comments, let me say that I'm very proud of the excellent second quarter results and pleased with how well we are positioned for the future. Furthermore, I believe the additional actions we are announcing today with regard to future capital allocation and overheads will help ensure we continue building value for shareholders going forward. Now, let me turn over the call over to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Bob? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Building on our strong Q1 results, PulteGroup's second quarter financials are highlighted by significant growth and performance gains in the business. Looking at the second quarter's homebuilding operations, home sale revenues were at $1.8 billion, which represents an increase of 41% over last year. The significant increase in revenue was driven by a 27% increase in closings to 4,772 homes, combined with an 11% or $35,000 increase in average selling price to $367,000. The 27% increase in closings was due to the strong orders we reported in recent quarters coupled with our previously discussed actions to put additional homes into production at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. As a result, our conversion rate for the quarter was 55%, which is up roughly 600 basis points over last year. I'd like to point out that although our conversion rate improved on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, tight labor resources, elongated build cycles and development and permitting delays remain meaningful challenges across many markets. As such, we continue to target conversion rate improvement versus last year, but don't expect we will return to the rates of several years ago in the short term. As a result, we currently project a conversion rate of between 51% and 54% in the third quarter this year. This compares to the 48% conversion rate in Q3 of last year. The 11% increase in average selling price for the quarter reflects the ongoing shift in the mix of our business towards move-up product. In addition to the shift in our mix, we also realized higher prices in each buyer group, including a 5% increase among first-time buyers to $270,000; an 11% increase in the price of move-up homes to $438,000; and a 4% increase in the average price of homes among our active adult buyers, $357,000. During the quarter, closing percentages by buyer group were as follows : 29% first-time, 44% move-up and 27% active adult. In Q2 of last year, closings by buyer group were 34% first-time, 35% move-up and 31% active adult. Given that our backlog ASP of $387,000 is up 13% over last year and up 5% for Q2 deliveries, we expect ASPs will continue to gradually move higher over the coming quarters. Our second quarter gross margin of 21.5%, which includes approximately 70 basis points of drag associated with our first quarter acquisition of the Wieland assets, was in line with previous guidance. Adjusting for the impact of the Wieland closings, gross margins were down approximately 110 basis points from last year, primarily as a result of mix, higher land and labor costs. The company remains on track to deliver full year margins of approximately 21.5%, and we expect margins over the remaining two quarters to be in the range of 21.2% to 21.7%, which is down slightly from prior guidance of 21.5% to 22%. Based on our current backlog, we see higher labor and material costs continuing to put slight pressure on margins. Offsetting some of the margin pressure, we continue to have success with our strategic pricing programs. In Q2, our total option revenues and lot premiums increased 5% over last year to approximately $67,000 per closing. In addition, sales discounts totaled 2.7%, which is up about 50 basis points from last year but consistent with our first quarter of this year's results. Second quarter SG&A was $192 million or 11% of home sale revenues. Prior-year SG&A spend of $130 million or 10.5% of revenues included a $27 million benefit or approximately 210 basis points resulting from a legal settlement. Increased SG&A spend in the quarter reflects ongoing growth in support of the company's 26% increase in units under production, combined with costs associated with higher healthcare insurance and professional fees incurred in the period. Although the absolute dollar spend is higher than forecast, we still expect full-year SG&A will be approximately 10% of revenues, allowing PulteGroup to maintain its operating margins among the industry leaders. At 10% of revenue, SG&A expenses are certainly within historical ranges, but as Richard discussed, we believe there are opportunities to drive greater overhead leverage. Based on our current targets, we expect to drive SG&A spend lower by at least 100 basis points in 2017 to 9% or lower of home sale revenues. Continuing down the income statement, we reported other expenses net of $13 million. This includes approximately $7 million of deposits and other pre-acquisition charges associated with the termination of several pending land transactions, as well as the final $7 million of costs associated with the relocation of our corporate office. Turning to financial services, we reported pre-tax income of $17 million, which is up from $10 million last year. These results benefited from the higher closing volumes in our homebuilding operations, as well as the favorable interest rate environment given the decline in rates experienced during the quarter. Our mortgage capture rate for the period was 81%, down from 83% in the second quarter of 2015. Consistent with company guidance, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38%, yielding Q2 net income of $118 million or $0.34 per share. EPS for the quarter was calculated on approximately 348 million shares, which is down 4% from last year, resulting largely from share repurchase activities. Moving past our income statement and looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 8,687 homes under construction at the end of the second quarter, of which 23% were spec. Consistent with our Q1 comments, after increasing spec home production in the back half of 2015 and into the first quarter of 2016 to help ensure a more consistent construction cadence, we have slowed spec starts somewhat as we build the backlog for the selling season. With an average of less than one finished spec per community, we remain in a very favorable inventory position. In the second quarter, we approved approximately 5,800 lots for purchase and ended the period with 143,000 lots under control. Consistent with recent quarters, about 29% of our lot position is controlled through options as we work to manage our land risk and drive higher returns on invested capital. Of our controlled lots, approximately 25% are developed. During the quarter, we spent $379 million on land acquisition and generally remain on track with 2016 plans to invest approximately $1.6 billion, including the purchase of the Wieland assets in new land positions. Consistent with Richard's comments and after several years of significant growth, we expect the rate of growth of our land acquisition spend to slow as we head into 2017. Recognizing that the current housing cycle is maturing, we are decreasing our land investment as a percentage of revenues, and could ultimately reduce the absolute dollars we spend depending upon our assessment of economic condition and their potential impact on the housing industry here in the U.S. Looking at share repurchase activity during the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for $48 million or $18.51 per share. This brings our total repurchase activity for the first half of the year to $98 million. Expanding on Richard's earlier comments about capital allocation, we've invested significantly in land-related development over the last few years, and we expect those investments to drive volume growth and strong cash flows for the next few years. We have also indicated that the growth in our investment is expected to moderate going forward. As a result, we feel we are well-positioned to increase the return of funds to shareholders, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities through the expanded share buyback program Richard outlined. We expect to take on a certain amount of incremental debt in connection with the outlined share repurchase activities, but we expect to be able to maintain a responsible and certainly very manageable debt-to-cap level throughout this process. As a reminder, our target debt-to-cap range remains unchanged at 30% to 40%. While we may have leverage rates outside this range at points in time, we continue to believe our targeted range is appropriate and will strive to operate in that range over the long-term. I'll just provide a couple more data points before turning over the call. Sign-ups for the second quarter were 5,697, which represents an increase of 11% over the prior year. On a dollar basis, sign-ups increased an even greater 21% to $2.1 billion. Sign-ups by buyer group break down as follows. First-time increased 12%, move-up increased 21%, and active adult declined 3%. Adjusting for changes in community counts, absorption pace has increased 23% and 5% for first-time and active adult buyers respectively, but were lower by 8% among move-up buyers. As we talked about on our prior call, given the higher price points among Wieland communities, absorption paces are slower than traditional Pulte communities, which impacted the move-up buyer results. During the second quarter, we operated from 700 communities, which is up 11% over last year. The 11% increase is in line with prior company guidance for year-over-year growth in community count of 8% to 10% in the first half of the year, expanding to 10% to 15% in the second half of 2016. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall for some comments on market conditions. Ryan? Ryan R. Marshall - President: Thanks, Bob. While there has been a lot of volatility in the global economic and financial markets, U.S. housing continues to move along the slow recovery path it has been following for the past five years. Government data as of May showing new home sales of 550,000 puts U.S. housing on track to deliver another year of roughly 10% growth. The trend is certainly positive. But after five years of recovery, we still remain well below the 50-year average, which is why we believe the recovery has a few years left. And while there is a lot of noise in the surrounding environment, there are certainly positives to be seen in the underlying economy, the job market, consumer confidence and the low mortgage rate conditions that are important drivers of ongoing demand. The demand conditions we realized in Q2 are consistent with those suggested by some of the broader housing stats which point to a sustained recovery, but with pockets of stronger and weaker demand, depending on geography and buyer segment. On a regional basis, demand conditions in the quarter were as follows : consistent with comments made on many of our prior calls, demand on the East Coast generally gets stronger as you move from north to south. Florida, Georgia and parts of the Carolinas continue to experience solid buyer demand as we benefited from strong local economies. Getting homes sold in some of our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, however, is a little more challenging as demand appears to be softer than at the start of the year. The middle third of the country covering our Midwest and Texas operations continue to experience strong demand conditions. All of our Midwest markets have been performing well, with notable gains in our Ohio and Kentucky operations as we continue to build on the Dominion positions we acquired in 2014. Our Texas markets are generally performing well. Dallas continues to experience exceptional strength, although maintaining the needed pace of land development in the market is challenging. Houston is still showing great resilience as demand continues to exceed expectations. Excessive rains earlier in the year have us behind on land development for Houston and Austin, but our teams are working hard to catch up on some of the delays. And finally, looking out west, demand remains solid throughout the area with good traffic and sign-up paces in Arizona, Nevada and California. Although it is among our smaller markets, Seattle has realized a nice jump in buyer demand as we get new communities open and new product on the ground. Overall, we are certainly pleased with the selling season for PulteGroup, as we realized good absorption paces and built a sizable backlog of sold homes. Our Q2 backlog is the highest in almost a decade, which sets us up well for the remainder of 2016. Having a large backlog allows us to provide a consistent flow of production, which is helpful when it comes to working with the trade base that we expect, will be stretched for the foreseeable future. In closing, I want to recognize the entire PulteGroup organization with special thanks to the sales and construction teams which are doing an outstanding job capitalizing on the market opportunities and managing the challenges that develop. Thanks to your efforts, we have tremendous momentum heading into the second half of the year. Let me now turn the call back to Richard for a few final comments. Richard? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks, Ryan. Before we open the call to questions, I want to take just a couple of minutes to comment on the other press release we issued this morning regarding the addition of three very talented executives to serve as independent directors on PulteGroup's board. For those of you who have followed homebuilding over the years, you will likely know the name John Peshkin. John spent much of his 30-year homebuilding career with Taylor Woodrow, including serving as the company's CEO for six years. John has also served on the boards of Standard Pacific and WCI Communities. I am also pleased to welcome Josh Gotbaum to the PulteGroup board. After spending more than a decade in investment banking at Lazard, Josh held senior level positions in the U.S. government and has recently served as Acting Chief Operating Officer of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Josh's extensive Wall Street and government experience will be a great add to the collective experiences of our board. Also joining our board will be Scott Powers, a financial services executive with over 30 years of experience. Scott, who was most recently President and CEO of State Street Global Advisors, has a long track record of success with some of the industry's premier asset managers including Old Mutual, Mellon Financial and Boston Company. We look forward to having the experiences of three such proven executives added to our board. I would also note that in addition to joining the board, John and Josh have both been added to the search committee which was recently established to identify PulteGroup's next CEO. The committee's work is well underway as they evaluate internal and external candidates. John and Josh will go to work immediately to get actively engaged in the process. And finally, I want to confirm that over the past several weeks, we have had conversations about broad business strategies and practices with Elliott Management, one of the company's shareholders. We certainly appreciate their perspectives about PulteGroup and ideas for creating long-term value for shareholders. I would also tell you that from our very first conversation, we were in agreement with many of their thoughts because we had already been evaluating these same opportunities to enhance the business and potential returns for our shareholders. As an example, PulteGroup's efforts to supplement its board with direct homebuilding and additional Wall Street experience were already underway. The final candidate selection was the result of a fruitful collaboration and discussion with Elliott. In short, all our discussions with Elliott were constructive and productive. Beyond just speaking with Elliott, we've had extensive conversations with many other large shareholders over the past several weeks and months. The feedback has been very consistent in terms of investor support for our Value Creation strategy and the tactics we have been implementing. We view the planned actions we announced today on capital allocation, land spend, SG&A and corporate governance as appropriate next steps in our Value Creation work as we work hard to drive even greater shareholder value from here. Now, let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications : Great. Thank you, Richard. We'll open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Scott, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is open. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi. Good morning, guys. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Good morning, Jack. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Jack. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah, busy morning today. I guess the first question, Richard, on the land spend versus the buyback, 143,000 lots. Should we think about your lot inventory declining? Should we think about the pipeline of land moving under the eight-year number as you redeploy that cash into buybacks? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Jack, we definitely discussed before we would like to get the total land number lower for sure. We have been over the last five years buying much shorter positions, but as we moderate the rate of growth in our land spend, we will have quite a bit of free cash flow. And we intend just as we outlined as part of our Value Creation strategy that any dollars not going into land will be returned to shareholders. So that's why we're up on the buyback today. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then on the cadence I think you had said $250 million a quarter. Is that a pretty reliable number we can work with? In the model I'm sort of looking at the new earnings run rate and book value numbers. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: It is, Jack. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Hi, guys. Good morning and a nice job in the quarter. Appreciate also the disclosures or the guidance on backlog conversion and some of the extra guidance there, so thank you for that. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: You bet. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: First question just on the expected cash flow from operations. I know you mentioned it sounds like you're not expected to cut the amount you're going to be spending on land, the rate of growth will slow. Is there any land sales contemplated over the next several quarters that's going to be a source of cash? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Alan, we have sold about $400 million worth of land over the last several years, and we're continually looking to prune unproductive assets. So that will continue, probably not in any great rate, not a big slug at any one time, but slowly over time you'll see that number continue to flow through a little bit. But to be clear, with all the investment we put in over the past four years, which as you know has been in the 30% to 40% annual range in terms of increases year-over-year, we'll have substantial cash coming off the business just from that investment for at least the next few years. So as we begin to moderate the rate of growth, we're still going to have substantial growth over the next few years, but the rate of cash coming in vis-\u00e0-vis the incremental cash going out for land will free up quite a bit of capital for repurchases. So to be clear, we're not intending on huge land sales to fund the buyback. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Understood. Thank you for that. And the second question. Just you made the comment that even with the slowing growth of land spend you still think there's several years of growth in the business. So I was hoping you might be able to frame that for us within the context of your comments about the cycle and where we are. It sounds like you used some different language this quarter just as far as maybe coming a little bit closer to the end of the cycle, or at least shifting the strategy a little bit. So, I think there's this view that the market is in a pretty steady growth phase, call it, 10% plus or minus and there's several large builders that expect that type of growth to continue for the next several years. So, A, would you agree with that as far as the market is concerned? And, B, within the Pulte specific camp, how do you see you trending versus the market as you move out beyond 2017? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Alan, Richard here again. A couple things. So we do agree with that statement, this slow and steady path for the next several years overall. The fact is we've been stepping on the gas pretty hard the last few years with regard to land spend and we're just going to moderate that a bit which will free up quite a bit of cash from operations. But that's our view collectively on the market. The second pieces is we realize that we have a large land base that we need to monetize and we're going to work really hard to have that continue to drive business for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning. A lot of stuff to digest today. Just wanted to start, Richard, when you're thinking about 2017 and maybe to Alan's question, is the right way to think about how you're planning for the business that 2017 is going to be the peak year for deliveries relative to the fact that land spend is going down? So deliveries like peak out in 2017 but you have a lower capital base and a more efficient balance sheet? Is that the strategy? Or am I missing something here? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Bob, I wouldn't necessarily say that 2017 will be the peak year for deliveries. The reality is, is that land that we put in place today it's 24 plus months before it comes on line. So when we began increasing investment back in 2013, we knew that 2016 would be a big year and we're expecting growth from here. So I can't comment on exactly when that growth peaks. And I'll point out that we're talking about only moderating the growth rate of land, not necessarily cutting the rate of land. So we're still projecting solid growth over the next several years and I want to be clear about that. So I wouldn't call for 2017 to be the peak. The reality is though we should be getting more and more efficient as we monetize this large land base we already have. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's an important distinction and a helpful one. Thanks for clarifying that. Can you walk me through, and maybe the ball goes to Bob's court. You're slowing the pace in land, it's partially calling the cycle, it's partially an effort to get better financial performance through the balance sheet. But what's the logic behind levering up to buy back stock given the fact that the stock's now trading at close to two times book and obviously that's a positive thing which shows the Value Creation plan has worked. So from my standpoint, I am trying to understand, if the cycle is further along than we'd anticipated, does it make sense to run to 40% to 50%? Why do you want to reinvest back on a systematic buyback program given the fact that the underlying land in your existing balance sheet's already appreciated, and the market recognizes the good work? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Bob, it's worth remembering, if you go back to, call it, December of 2014, I think, when we had our Investor Day and laid out what our uses of capital were going to be, this is really the execution of that. So we highlighted we want to invest in high growth or high return opportunities, and when that, as we've talked about, has moderated not stopping to Richard's point, but moderating the growth of it \u2013 so we'll still be investing a fair amount of money \u2013 using that excess cash flow to return to shareholders. And the important thing and you've asked the question, is around that it hinges on debt-to-cap between 30% and 40%. Today, we're at 35%. We're talking about incremental leverage over that next 18 months that isn't really terribly significant. Again, we highlight that we might go a little bit above 40%, but not a lot. And again, what we've indicated is that we would seek to get back down under 40% as time goes by because that's what we've outlined in terms of our priorities. So we've not tried to make a determination of market. So when we've been buying back equity over the last two or three years, we have a view about market values. But typically, we're buying on a relatively consistent basis with the cash we have available. And other than trading what we think is intelligently as the market price changes, we're not saying we think the stock is expensive or inexpensive; we're just returning shareholder funds. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and also a lot to digest and I think a lot of good stuff. Just wanted to try and get a little bit more clarity as we think about 2017, and I know that it appears that you're not going to give too much in terms of guidance. But maybe just some rough ways to think about the upcoming year. I think a lot of people are trying to figure out \u2013 and I think you've given some talking points to it in terms of when you talk about slowing growth in land spend, what does that mean for closings growth next year? Certainly, you've reiterated your community count guidance for the back half of the year. How should we think about community count in 2017? And it would seem that you should still be able to do some amount of closings growth but maybe sub-10%. Is that fair? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Hey, Mike. This is Richard. I want to be crystal clear for everyone on the call. What we're doing today will not impact our 2017 volumes. When we buy land in this space, it's for at least 24 months out. No one should model or change their view on what our growth should be relative to 2017 here at all. That's why we commented extensively in our release that we will be growing for the next several years. And I also want to point out, we're talking about moderating the rate of growth in our land spend, and we've been growing substantially. So there's lots of growth to come. The reality is we have a large balance sheet, and we're just going to monetize that to a better degree, I believe, than we have in the past and use the cash flow to help buy back equity. And to a comment that was asked on the previous question, no one's talking about leverage anywhere near 50% here. Bob stated very clearly we want to stay within that 30% to 40% range. And if we get outside of it, we'll work hard to bring it back in. So just wanted to clarify there. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No, I appreciate that. And I guess, again, how it affects your 2017 notwithstanding, which you're saying it won't, I think if there's any ability to give any sense of how you're thinking about closing volume growth for next year that would be helpful. And also kind of moving on to the second question, again incremental clarity. I just ran some very quick numbers on some more share buyback and a little more leverage, and \u2013 or a little more debt, and it does appear that you'd at worst be in a perhaps a 40% to 45% range, and again that would be for a brief amount of time. Is that the right way to think about that, Bob? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Let me just \u2013 I'll address both. Typically, to your first question on 2017, we would give color on 2017 later this year, and we would expect to do that, not today. In terms of the leverage rates, like anything else in life, it depends on when we go to market; how the business cash flows are generated over time. But again, I would tell you that our expectation is at the end of 2017, with the buyback levels that we're talking about, we don't think we get much outside of 40%, to Richard's earlier comment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Stephen F. East - Wells Fargo : Thank you. Just, Richard, you talked early on about overhead leverage, generating that. Could you talk about what specific actions you all have in plan and how we should expect this to trend as we go through the next 18 months? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Steve, that is still underway internally. So I don't want to get too detailed here. But we are looking at reducing overhead costs throughout the operation collectively. And I would expect that the actions we take there will be taken in third quarter and that our newly established run rate will be in place for Q4. So we'll have more to say on our Q3 call clearly about the detail there. But we expect to reduce our overhead costs in Q3. Stephen F. East - Wells Fargo : Okay. And then I'm just going to jam in two questions here, if I could. One, some of the organic metrics, excluding Wieland what the orders were, what the community count was. And then do you have any type of timing on the CEO search? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: I'll answer the first, and then maybe Bob or Ryan could comment on the business excluding Wieland. I'm not involved in the search, Stephen, but I do know the committee is underway. They've engaged an outside firm and they intend to get the two new directors up to speed immediately. And I know there's plans to do that like literally immediately. So I can't speak for the committee, but I would hope that over the next couple of months they would be able to wrap up their work. So not specificity there, but sometime in the not too distant future, I would think. And on the other comment - Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Stephen, on Wieland, we're not going to give detail on Wieland versus the rest of the business. What I'll offer is our absorption pace, as we highlighted, were up 23% in first-time, down 8% in move-up, up 5% in active adult. Again, Wieland sits in that move-up space and absent the Wieland business that would have been flat year-over-year. So in total, our absorption paces were flat Q2 versus Q2 last year. They would have been up somewhat instead if we hadn't had the Wieland business. And we did highlight 70 basis points of margin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Good morning. Curious as you look at the business now from a segment standpoint where the demand is or for land costs, or where land costs are or where selling prices are? And what you're seeing in the business that has you evaluating where we are in the cycle is what I'm trying to figure out? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Eric, I think it's fair to say we feel like we're somewhere in the middle of the cycle. We're not in the early stages of the cycle. It is maturing and land costs are up. I'll echo something that Bob put in his script. We're proud of our operating margin performance and we are taking some SG&A action to help keep that. As land prices and labor prices are not allowing quite as much pricing power as we've had in the past on account of the gross margin side. So it's a very healthy housing market, we're really pleased with our absorption paces and we project the next few years are going to bring more of the same. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Just to follow up. That's helpful. I can understand the land and labor influence on the cost side of the gross margin equation. I guess on the selling price side of that, where within the markets are there segments of the market where, or segments of demand where it's harder to raise price to earn a really attractive gross margin that makes you feel a little bit different about volume? Ryan R. Marshall - President: Eric, this is Ryan. What I would tell you is that the first few weeks of July have continued to show typical seasonal selling patterns, and we continue to see local economies drive pockets of strength and/or weakness as we move across the country. One great example that I'll give you is our Dallas market. That's a market where the local economy continues to do very well and we're seeing nice pricing power throughout all of the segments. And the other thing that I would just point out to you, Eric, is we continue to say through our Value Creation strategy there are focuses on driving high returns. Margins are certainly a component of driving high returns but it's not the only thing that we focus on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Will Randow from Citigroup. Your line is open. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Hi, Will. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I guess in terms of \u2013 you gave some regional color on Florida and the Northeast, which I found interesting, because markets like the Mid-Atlantic for resale were quite strong. Can you talk about where you saw the pockets of softness in the Northeast, as well as the pockets of strength in Florida? Ryan R. Marshall - President: Yeah, Will. Where we've seen pockets of relative weakness over prior year were in the Northeast market specifically, New Jersey, and our Boston area markets. We saw nice strength in D.C. and throughout Florida was very strong. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for that. And then I hate to beat a dead horse, but in terms of reduced land spend, should we anticipate that's mainly targeted at, I'll call it, non-Pulte Homes brands, specifically probably more like Centex? And I guess, as a side note, in terms of cash flows, does this mean that you're not necessarily pursuing an investment-grade rating over the next, I'll call it, year and a half? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Will, this is Richard. We're not giving color on where exactly our moderation in land spend will affect it. As Bob indicated, as we get closer to the end of the year, we'll provide additional color going forward, but I want to be clear, that won't be affecting the next couple of years' worth of volume. And then with regard to investment grade, I'll just make one opening comment and then turn it to Bob. We are intending to maintain our investment discipline and our debt to capital discipline, which we've outlined five years ago as part of Value Creation was our target range. So with that, Bob, do you want to talk about the rating? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I would just make two comments. One, on the capital. To your question, I don't think it would change our perspective. Our land teams have \u2013 we are agnostic to what land they're buying, so we're not going to say \u2013 we're not going to spend as much and we particularly don't want you to buy entry-level or something like that. So the teams have the capacity to make the investment decisions. And then with respect to the agencies, and I think Richard said it all, we will maintain the discipline we have. We think we've got a business that is supportive of an investment grade whether they get there or not. This will introduce some more leverage but certainly within the guidelines that we outlined. And if not, we'd seek to get back inside. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Hi, Ken. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Ken. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: In regards to the gross margin for the back half, I wonder if you could explore that a little bit. I see the order pace is going along with how we would expect, but I wonder, because you've had this really strong growth in closings, especially in the first half in general. What was the factor or region that is causing that modest trim down, realizing you're obviously taking cost actions on the G&A side to offset that structurally. But could you go into that a little bit? Is it labor? Is it the land? Is it the pricing wasn't as strong and within regions? Thank you. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Ken, I think the answer is all of the above to some extent. Certainly, Wieland is impacting our margins consistent with the way we thought they would. Mix matters. If you look at our second quarter of this year versus second quarter of last year, Del Webb, or active adult I should say, is less of a contributor and it is our highest margin business so that on a mix adjusted basis takes our margins down. And to be clear and we've said this over time, land prices have gone up over time and that more expensive land cycles into our mix. Labor costs are up. We have a generally positive or favorable commodity market, so the input costs there, but labor is expensive. We've suggested or we've guided that 1.5% to 2% growth in our house cost, and again, a lot of that is labor. So all those things factor in as we look at what we've had occur in this quarter and what's going to happen over the next couple of quarters. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: And Ken, this is Richard. I'll just add one thing. We are committed to operating margin excellence regardless of what gross margins are doing, and we're pleased with where our gross margins are. They're still on a relative basis quite strong, but we just want to be clear that we want to maintain our lead in operating margins. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: No, I understand that. And obviously, you're taking the SG&A actions. In regards to your comments, since you're not talking about 2017 in terms of operational metrics, like closings or community count, and your land actions this year are not impacting 2017, could you talk about the volume assumptions? How are you getting to that 9%? Is it just on cost reductions, efficiency, or how much leverage is occurring due to variables you're not commenting on, I guess? How would you describe that? Thank you very much. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: It's a bit of both. We are counting on revenue growth and volume growth, and we're counting on dollars, actual dollars, coming out of the business as well. We're not providing any more color than that at this stage. As Bob indicated, we'll have more to say a little bit later in the year, but we're pleased with the fact that we'll be getting incremental leverage on the business next year. And the other thing I'll just say about it is our 2017 volumes will be driven by what we invested in 2014, 2015 timeframe primarily. So that's why we know we'll have growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is open. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Not to beat a dead horse here, but the 9% SG&A target, I just want to be clear that you guys think that you can achieve that kind of leverage on volume and also some structural cost reductions and it's not really coming at the expense of community count growth, is that correct? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: That's 100% correct, yes. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then if I missed this, I apologize. But in the press release, you talked about a $0.03 charge from pending land transactions and also a corporate relocation. Maybe if you can give a little bit more detail on that, particularly on the corporate relocation, which I thought would've been well behind us at this point. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. As we highlighted, that's actually what we think of the final costs associated with that and really we vacated the last space we had in Michigan. So it just was dependent on when we actually got folks consolidated in one spot. So we think that one is completely behind us now. As it relates to the pending land transactions, essentially, it's one fairly significant and complex transaction that we've been working on for a number of years, the entitlements were challenging, and as we move forward because of some of the cost elements of it candidly, the deal just didn't make a lot of sense. And rather than push it forward because we had a lot of money invested in it, we decided to walk away rather than make it a long-term problem for us. So kind of a unique circumstance in that one. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Your line is open. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Susan. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Hi, Susan. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : In the last call, you guys went through and you gave some really good information around your impaired land and how to think about the margin impact as those lots come back. And as we're one quarter further and we hear about this newer land strategy or this updated land strategy that's coming together. Is there any change in the thought around those impaired assets and perhaps the timing or the pace at which they may come and you start closing more homes on them? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Susan, just want to be clear, we haven't changed our strategy with respect to land. All we've said is we're not going to grow our investment in land at the 30%-plus rate that we have for the last three or four years. Our strategies remain the same. In terms of our ability to monetize those assets, you heard Richard say we've sold probably $400-ish million over the last four or five years of non-core assets. And so we will continue to seek to do that. Those will be kind of lumpy as things become marketable if they're out there, and there aren't a ton of them, candidly. We've got, as an example, less than $100 million on the balance sheet today of land held for sale which is stuff that we would think would transact in the relatively short-term. And obviously with respect to some of our other longer-dated positions, we've talked about those pretty consistently over time where we're just seeking to drive the best return we can off of forward investment, and so as demand is there we will sell those. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then in terms of Texas, I know that you noted in your comments that you are a bit behind on the operations there just because of the rain that was experienced earlier in the year, but you had some good closings and you had some order growth there, actually. Can you just give us a bit more color on that? Ryan R. Marshall - President: Yeah, Susan, this is Ryan. We're very pleased with what's happening out of our Texas operations including the demand. Certainly, the weather has been a factor. I'll tell you that the weather's probably most greatly impacted our ability to develop land. As the dirt has just become so saturated, we have to wait for it to dry out. We don't anticipate it having a significant effect on our operations and ability to deliver future closings out of our Texas markets. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: And, Susan, the conversion improvement that we had in the quarter, which Bob noted we expect continued improvement vis-\u00e0-vis last year, that's a result of the better pace of inventory management that we put in place over the past six to nine months, and I think Ryan detailed that quite a bit on the last call, and we're pleased. We've got more inventory in the ground that is helping. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good morning. I was hoping to ask one more question about just framing the margin environment. And on the 9% SG&A, how much of getting from 10% to 9% in fiscal 2016 to 2017, how much of that is incremental to your prior, what you would've planned prior to this? And should we think of this as you talked about some of the gross margin pressures, you're obviously focused on holding operating margin, so is it fair to characterize that as we look ahead, your current gross margin basis is roughly that 50 to 100 basis points lower that you're now looking to offset on the SG&A side? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Mike, we're not giving guidance beyond what we have in terms of margin. I think what we're trying to communicate on the expense side is, we're looking to maintain the efficiency of our operations. We think we have an opportunity to run the business with a little bit less cost. And so I don't think there's any correlation necessarily between the margin conversation and the expense conversation. The margins will be what they are depending on market conditions and our ability to control costs. We are going to try and drive better efficiency in our operations to reduce expenses. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. And then secondly, just since there's the new buyback out there and the bulk of it is coming at a point when there's a leadership transition. And so if we think about the search that's going on and the candidates being evaluated, is the board committed to finding someone who is entirely aligned with this current strategy or is there a chance that someone will come in and we'll see another shift in strategy next year? Just any comments around if there's a tie between the two right now. Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Mike, this is Richard. The board is very aligned, as the leadership team is, around this Value Creation strategy. I wouldn't want to comment specifically on what the next CEO would do. But I can tell you that our board members who have spoken with investors have been very clear that they are committed to value creation. So that certainly will influence the next CEO's thinking around this. And it's been successful strategy for the company, so we're pleased with it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Your line is open. Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC : Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups. It sounds as if you're sort of reevaluating where we are in the cycle and shifting your strategy a little bit. I'm curious if that has changed any of the specifics around your land-buying strategy. At this stage in the cycle, do you place more emphasis on some of your risk factors in your model than others? Does your view on growth in the different segments of the market change how, not necessarily the amount of land that you're spending, but how you might spend that land, or do those risk factors and priorities stay the same no matter where we are in the cycle? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Megan, this is Richard. I think I can help with that. We view everything we're announcing today as a continuation and perhaps an enhancement of what we've already been doing, which is shortening the overall length of positions that we're taking on the land side. We gave some good disclosure before that the last several years we've been buying much shorter positions. So that continues. What we are also saying is that with 143,000 lots, we have a lot of dry powder to monetize from here and that we don't need to grow our rate of land spend at 30% or 40% a year, as Bob indicated, going forward. But the care with which we underwrite deals, the focus on closer-to-the-city properties, the discipline to stay away from those tertiary B and C locations, the idea to not take on 10 years', 15 years' worth of land risk on any one deal, that all stays the same going forward. And to be clear, we do think the market's got several years of growth ahead of it. We're just trying to be prudent with regard to recognizing the large land book that we have. Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks. And just there had been some concern in recent weeks about perhaps the market slowing at the tail end of the quarter. Can you talk a little about cadence throughout the second quarter? Ryan R. Marshall - President: Megan \u2013 or this is Ryan. What I would tell you is that the first few weeks of July have proven to be very similar to previous seasonal patterns that we've seen in prior years, and it's very normal. The cadence has proven out to be very normal seasonal type patterns. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I want to maybe follow up on Megan's question just in a slightly different way, going back to that recognition that the cycle is maturing and that maybe you're dialing back the land investments. You still have a fairly broad range of product categories. Does it change how you think about the mix of the brands you have? Does it make you think that would it make more sense to be a more streamlined builder around the move-up categories, or do you want to continue to have a line in the water on all the different price segments right now? Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.: Buck, this is Richard. That'll continue to be driven by what our local operators are seeing with regard to demand in their business, and that's candidly fluid all the time. So as an example, if you operate in Southwest Florida, we're doing a lot of active adult business because that's the business there, whereas in Texas, the entry-level's quite strong. So our local operations and what they're seeing will continue to let that land seek its natural place of highest return. So we're not trying to make a macro call on the segment. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And just quickly as a follow-up, the 23% increase in first-time buyer absorption, or those communities for first-time buyers, how much of that is a function of the shift of putting more spec into production? Did that disproportionately affect those types of communities, or is it more of a true market shift in demand? Can you help us add some context to that number? Ryan R. Marshall - President: Buck, this is Ryan. What we're seeing is it's a true shift in demand in the marketplace, doesn't really have anything to do with our spec strategy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weintraub \u2013 Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. On the Wieland acquisition, I think you mentioned, it had about a 70-basis-point impact in the quarter. Is that a similar amount is expected in the current quarter and when might you see that unwinding, do you think? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We had said that it would be 70-ish basis points this year as we work through the acquired inventory. So I think you'll see it for the balance of this year but not into next year. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then in terms of any financing that you might do for the repurchase program, et cetera, are you leaning to short term or would you be potentially going some more longer term debt, or how should we think about that? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think market conditions will help us to make that decision over time. This business, I think, is best served by longer-term capital markets activity as opposed to short term or something of this nature. I think that's still consistent. We'll look at the markets as we get to a point where we're going to issue debt. They're attractive today, so that would be a at-market-time decision. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And just lastly, doing quick back-of-the-envelope math, it seems to me that the majority of the share repurchase program would be financed by free cash flow. You did mention there would be some debt financing. But if you're going to stay in the 40%, maybe a little bit above that, it seems that the majority would be from free cash flow. Is that a fair conclusion? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think we have indicated where we think leverage goes. And again, it can \u2013 within the six-quarter period when we borrow matters; when we earn money matters. And so you'll see some volatility or variability \u2013 better choice of words. But we don't see it getting as much outside of our targeted leverage rate by the time all is said and done. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead sir. James Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Audra and good morning to everyone participating in today's call. I want to welcome you to PulteGroup's conference call to discuss our third quarter financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Joining me for today's call are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; James Ossowski, Vice President-Finance and Controller. A copy of this morning's earnings release and presentation slides that accompany today's calls have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We'll also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later today. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Jim. This morning's press release detailed our Q3 results show the company delivered another quarter of double-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines. And consistent with positive demand trends in U.S. housing, we realized one our largest increases in sign-ups in recent years, up 17% in units and 25% in dollar value as our business continues to benefit from the increased land investments we made in recent years. Particularly encouraging is that we realized higher sales across all buyer groups which is a great sign on the overall health of the market. Along with showing strong demand on the front end, we realized a 16% increase in deliveries for the quarter which drove a 29% gain in top line revenues to $1.9 billion. The top line growth in business carried through to the bottom line as the company generated a significant expansion in earnings for the third quarter. Overall, I am very pleased with the company's very strong third quarter. Before I turn over the call, however, there are a few other thoughts I'd like to offer before we get into discussing our operating results. Since being named CEO in September I've had the opportunity to speak with a number of shareholders including meeting more than 60 investors during my attendance at one of the industry's larger home building conference of several weeks ago. These conversations gave me the chance to exchange questions and comments with investors about PulteGroup, our strategy, about management and board changes and most importantly about the fundamentals of the housing market. The conversations were wide-ranging there were however a handful of questions which routinely came up regarding how we plan to run the business and what if any changes we plan to make. Given the consistent level of investor interest, I thought it appropriate to share a few of my answers with this larger group. First, I\u2019ve been with the PulteGroup for more than 15 years most of that time was spent in our operations running some of our largest businesses and more recently as a senior officer managing many of our corporate staff functions. In other words, I've been deeply involved in and work closely with Richard on the development and implementation of the company's Value Creation strategy. I've seen firsthand the significant operating and financial benefits we've realized from great Value Creation since its launch over five years ago. I certainly remain an advocate of Value Creation and plan to continue operating against the strategy going forward. That being said, I think it's appropriate to state that my background and my career experiences are unique and different from Richard's, so over time you could see us emphasize certain things more strongly than we have in the past. For example, having spent most of my career in the operations, I can tell you that operations is an area of particular focus even passion for me. I am and will continue investing a lot of my time with my staff and our field leaders on finding opportunities to drive greater construction efficiencies and squeeze additional costs from our building processes, programs such as common plan management, value engineering and strategic pricing have been very successful and will be working hard to build on these programs going forward. Over the last five years we have raised PulteGroup's gross margins to be arguably the best in the industry and we certainly want to keep it that way. Beyond the operations, we've also made progress adjusting our land portfolio to match our Value Creation goals of generating higher returns while managing our risk. I believe, however, there is more for us to accomplish. For example, based on our trailing 12 months of deliveries we own approximately 5.2 years of lots which is down from 7.7 years in 2011. Over time I would like to see this number continue to move lower and ultimately get below four years, even approaching three years of ownership. While this will take years to accomplish, there are actions we have implemented which should allow our own land position to decline gradually over time. First, we are focusing our investments on shorter, faster turning communities. Second, we're working through our larger legacy web positions which will allow us to reduce the 7.4 years of active adult lots we own today. And third, we are well-positioned to continue to grow our unit volume which effectively reduces our years of own supply. By focusing on shortening the duration of our land assets, we can accelerate inventory turns, improve returns on invested capital and reduce some of the risks inherent in the business. This will take time to accomplish, but I wanted you to understand the long-term direction for the company. And finally also relating to our investment practices I think the potential exists for us to be a little more balanced in our market position. We've clearly capitalized on the strong demand within the move-up category, but I see opportunities for us to realize a better balance across the buyer groups we serve. Today approximately 45% of our deliveries are to move-up buyers, but at a division level this percentage can be higher. Going forward, I believe we can diversify and expand our business among first-time buyers where market demand appears to be accelerating. We will seek to replicate the success certain PulteGroup markets have achieved by building our first-time business in more markets across the country. On this front I would note that approximately 40% of our land approvals in the third quarter were for first-time buyer communities which is higher than recent quarters. Obviously these are very high level thoughts, but I wanted to provide some insights into how I view the business. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of the quarter. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks Ryan and good morning everybody. As we have discussed on recent calls, 2016 reflects the growth we've expected given our increasing land spend over the last several years. Q3 clearly continues that trend as home sale revenues grew by 29% to $1.9 billion, driven by a 16% increase in closing 5,037 homes, combined with an 11% or $37,000 increase in average selling price to $374,000. Consistent with our prior guidance, our deliveries of 5,037 homes represented a conversion rate of 52% in the quarter which represents roughly 400 basis point improvement over the third quarter of last year. Our conversion rates have improved, but labor resources in many markets remain stressed and will likely continue to be so during the housing recovery. Based on feedback from our division President it's clear that labor availability has gotten even tighter relative to last year and continues to impact production timelines. Our decision last year to put a few more spec homes into production has turned out to be the right one given these market dynamics. Looking at the fourth quarter we currently project our conversion rates to be in the range between 62% and 64%. This represents a meaningful increase over the third quarter and is comparable with the fourth quarter of last year. We're pleased with the improvements we've made to our production cadence especially in light of the challenging trading environment. One item to note however is the potential impact of Hurricane Matthew on our operations. We were fortunate that none of our employees were injured and our communities weathered the storm extremely well, so our recovery time should be quick. This is likely not true for the local power companies which have a lot of work in front of restoring power and rebuilding infrastructure. As that activity will take priority over installing meters or even bringing power to our new subdivisions, it's possible that we may face production and delivery delays in affected areas. Looking at our closings by buyer group during the quarter 29% were first-time, 44% were move-up and 27% were active adult. In the comparable prior year period the breakdown was 33% first-time, 35% move-up and 32% active adult. The 11% gain an average selling price of the quarter reflects the higher percentage of move-up closings as well as higher prices realized in each buyer group. In fact our average selling prices increased 8% to $283,000 from our first-time buyers, 11% to 441,000 move-up buyers and 4% to $358,000 among our active adult buyers. With our backlog ASP showing an increase of 11% to $393,000 compared to last year which is also up 5% from our Q3 deliveries, we expect our average selling prices to continue moving gradually higher in the coming quarters. The company's reported gross margin for Q3 was 21.1% which was 10 basis points below our guidance range. Beyond margin pressure from higher absolute land cost is recycled through our land pipeline we continue to experience labor rate inflation as it relates to both land development and house construction costs. We had anticipated house cost to rise 1.5%, 2% this year, but labor costs are running outside of that band in many of our markets. While we expected cost to rise at this stage of housing cycle market dynamics are not allowing these costs to be passed through to home buyers at the same rate we experienced over the past few years. Assuming these conditions continuing in Q4 and into 2017 we now expect Q4 margins to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Further, we expect this range will likely carry through for the full year 2017. As is our practice we will update you as the year progresses. Our margin trend has been lower, I think it's important to highlight that we're still generating the highest margins among the big builders. As a reminder our convention to include sales commissions and cost of sales, while most of the industry reports commissions in SG&A. As a result on a comparative basis our reported gross margins present lower than our peers. On average our commissions are approximately 350 basis points of revenue, on a comparable basis our reported Q3 gross margin of 21.1% would equate to 24.6%. We believe part of the reason for our strong relative margins is our strategy to maximize the amount of lot premium and option revenues we generate as these are our highest margin revenue streams. In the third quarter our total option revenues and lot premiums increase 9% over last year to approximately $71,000 for closing. Sales discounts in the third quarter were 2.7% of sales which is flat with Q2 this year and up about 70 basis points from last year, but roughly $10,000 per home certainly remain modest. SG&A spend in the third quarter was $183 million or 9.7% home sale revenues. Included in this total are $8 million of severance costs associated with actions taken in the quarter to reduce overhead expenses. Among the actions we took was a reduction in our workforce of approximately 350 people. The majority of those reductions took place in our corporate or area structures. Many of those roles have been established the outside of our Value Creation efforts, but could be cut back as related initiatives are now part of standard operating procedures. In implementing these actions we're obviously very careful to ensure we didn't hinder the ability of our field operations to manage what we expect to be a growing volume of business in 2017 and beyond. Also included in this quarter's SG&A were approximately $4 million of cost with shareholders activities. Having successfully reached agreements with two of larger shareholders, we expect these costs to drop materially going forward. As a reminder on our last call we discuss plan to cut SG&A costs from expected 10% of revenues in 2016 to a target of 9% in 2017. All significant activity related to the actions to achieve our targeted spent level in 2017 were completed during the quarter. Last year's third quarter SG&A spent of $159 million or 10.9% of revenues included a $6 million benefit associated with the reserve adjustment taken in the period. In the third quarter of this year we also reported $20 million of charges within other expenses net. This includes the $15 million charge to the settlement of a dispute over a land transaction that we terminated a decade ago with the collapse of the housing market. In addition to $5 million of lease exit and related costs taken in connection with SG&A reduction.  Financial services during the quarter generated pretax income of $21 million, up from $14 million last year as it benefited primarily from higher construction volumes in our home building operations. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 81% compared to 83% last year. Our tax rate in the quarter was 39.5% which compares to our prior guidance of 38%. The increase relates to adjustments to our deferred tax assets resulting from changes in certain state tax rates, which impacted our reported earnings by $0.01 per share. Reported net income for the quarter was $128 million or $0.37 per share which includes the $31 million pretax charges I detailed that reduced our reported earnings per share by $0.06 per share. Earnings per share for the quarter was calculated using approximately 342 million shares outstanding which is down 3% from last year resulting largely from share repurchase activities. Looking at our home building operations, we have 9,235 homes under construction at the end of the third quarter which is up 18% over last year. Consistent with our strategy to increase specs, but at controlled rate specs were 24% of Q3 homes under construction which is up from 17% in Q3 of last year, but effectively flat on a sequential basis from the second quarter of this year. We ended the quarter with 600 finish specs or less than one per community which is up only slightly from the second quarter of this year. We recorded 4,775 sign-ups during the third quarter which represents an increase of 17% over the prior year. On a dollar basis sign-ups increased even greater 25% to $1.8 million. Looking at our sign-ups by buyer group, first-time increased 8%, move-up increased 30% and active adult increased 9%. Adjusting for changes in community count our absorption pace increased 4% for the first-time buyers and 14% among active adult buyer, so we're lower by 4% among move-up buyers. Beyond the impact from our Wieland communities which has slower absorption paces given their higher prices some divisions have noted move-up buyers are taking longer to sign contracts. During the third quarter we operated from 709 communities which is up 16% over last year. The year-over-year increases consistent with prior guidance for community count growth over the prior year in the range of 10% to 15%. We remain active in the land acquisition arena. During the third quarter we approved approximately 3,100 lots for purchase. At the end of September we owned approximately 102,000 lots and controlled an additional 43,000 lots via option. In total, we spent $266 million on land acquisition during the quarter which brings our nine-month spend to approximately $910 million excluding our purchase of Wieland assets. During the quarter we also repurchased 12 million of our shares representing just over 3% of our outstanding float for $250 million or $20.77 per share. This brings our total repurchase activity during 2016 to approximately 18 million shares for $350 million. As we discussed our Q2 call we plan to continue to return excess funds to shareholders subject to market conditions through repurchase of an additional $250 million of shares in Q4 and $1 billion in 2017. In July we raise the $1 billion of five and 10-year debt to very attractive rate. Proceeds from the transaction were used to repay approximately $500 million outstanding debt as well as to help fund our operations and our share repurchase activities.  We ended the quarter with a debt to cap ratio of 40% which is within 30% to 40% range we seek to operate in. Depending upon timing of future share repurchases we may move above 40%, but expected future earnings should work to quickly delever our overall capital structure. We ended the quarter with $461 million of cash which results in a net debt to cap ratio of 36%. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan for some comments on market conditions. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Bob. While there can be conflicting signals from period to period across the variety of metrics people track, I think most feel that economic conditions are improving albeit at a slower pace than most would like. Recent moves higher by 10-year treasury rates further suggest that economy continues to get stronger, certainly the sizable gain seen in recent U.S. new home sales data supports the position that housing remains on a sustained path of recovery. As has been the case for the past several years demand is being aided by low unemployment, job formations, a low interest rate environment and generally favorable supply dynamics with the 17% increase in units and a 25% increase in dollars, PulteGroup's third quarter sign-up data tracks the move higher in the broader housing market and anecdotal comments from our field reinforce the view that while there can be volatility from point-to-point the overall trend is for modestly higher volume. For example, looking at the demand conditions in the quarter on a regional basis we saw the following; strong demand in Florida and much of the southeast although Charlotte and Raleigh were a little bit choppy during the quarter at some of the higher price points. We didn't see much change in the mid-Atlantic and northeast markets where we're having to compete for each new sign-up. We have our eyes open for any possible acceleration in DC once we get through the election cycle. Our Midwest and Texas operations continue to see strong demand conditions across the markets and throughout the quarter. As we said before Houston has held up much better than expected and given the recent rise in oil prices it could be that the worst has already passed. Finally, in the western third of the country demand was solid throughout the quarter as we continue to experience good sign-up paces in our major markets of Phoenix, Las Vegas and northern and southern California. Through the first few weeks of October demand appears to be on its normal seasonal track. Overall, we are very pleased with Q3 and more broadly the first nine months of the year as we were able to get new communities open and they were met with strong buyer interest. With over 9,400 homes in backlog we are well-positioned to complete a very strong 2016. Let me close by saying it's a positive to have reached a resolution with two of our major shareholders and to have removed any uncertainties related to company leadership as we successfully completed our announced CEO transition. Now we can focus conversations are talking about the business. As you read this morning and you heard in our comments there are a lot of positives to discuss. And finally, I want to say thank you to the employees of PulteGroup, you've done an amazing job staying focused on serving our customers and delivering great quality homes. Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Ryan. We will open the call for questions so that we can speak to as many participants as possible during the remaining time we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Audra, could you explain the process to get started? Operator : Certainly. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Miss Nishu Sood at Deutsche Bank. Timothy Daley : Well, this is actually Tim Daley for Nishu Sood. Thank you for taking my call. My first question is regarding kind of absorption pace that you guys saw this quarter. So, there's a bit of concern out there that pushing volumes via absorption rather than community count could accelerate some gross margin slippage. But that was -- didn't seem to be the case this quarter with most of the order growth coming from community count. So, obviously, the gross margin a bit of the pressure mainly came from the labor. But as you move forward, do you have the communities in the pipeline ready to go or do you expect some gains to come from absorptions going forward? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, Tim, I think if you are asking about over the next 12 to 18 months, certainly we own all the land that we have. We've got production slated for both land development and opening of communities. So I think what you've seen at least in our quarter is that absorptions held pretty firm, you know, they were up 4% in the first-time space, ours are down 3% in the move-up which includes Wieland and a little bit of stickiness and nice pace in the active adult space, you know, being up 14%, 15%. So the market there's some supply out there. So I think at the end of the day -- I can't speak to what others are going to do, but I think you can expect to see the same from us trying to realize return we're going to keep selling communities. Ryan Marshall : Tim, this is Ryan. The other thing that I would just point out on the community count guidance we had provided guidance in the back half of the year to show 10% to 15% growth year-over-year. And as you can see from our reported quarter -- in the third quarter we reported 16% growth year-over-year which demonstrates we've gotten our new communities open. Timothy Daley : All right. Great. Just to follow-up quickly, so you touched on the 40% of land approvals in 3Q being the first-time versus I think you mentioned about 29% of closings for 3Q. So with this low -- the shorter land profile that you guys have on the investment, were these kind of similar to the two-to-three-year investment kind of horizon that you've been talking about recently? And how does that gross margin compare and when should it mix in? Ryan Marshall : Tim, this is Ryan. It does fall in terms of the tenor of land, the averages that we've been running have been just shy of three years with recent approvals and this quarter is consistent with that. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Like everything else, Tim, we don't underwrite to margin, we underwrite to return. And so, you know, everyone of this sort of unique, how many of them are options, how many of them are wrong with development work, but we haven't seen a significant change actually in the margins that we're seeing in the underwriting process. Operator : We will go next to Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I had was on also around the first-time and the margins and Ryan, some of your comments regarding kind of recognizing some of the stronger demand theme for that segment. So how should we think about given that you are increasing proportion of your land spend, I would presume that, that's kind of baked into your gross margin guidance for next year? Just trying to get a sense of what you're on track to do in terms of first-time percent of deliveries for 2016? And if the 2017 guidance bakes in any incremental exposure as may be you do a soft shift increasing towards that segment? Ryan Marshall : Hey, Mike. It\u2019s Ryan. I'll take the first piece of that and I'll have Bob to give you a few more comments. But in terms of our first -- the acquisitions that we've made that are targeted towards the first-time buyer there won't be any impact on our 2017 margins. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah, exactly. So if we're putting land under contract today it's going to be 2018 production and beyond, so in terms of mix shift you won't see anything until then. Ryan Marshall : And Mike the only other thing that I would add to that is that to reiterate what Bob's comment was a minute ago, we don't underwrite the margin, we underwrite the return. Margin is certainly an important component of the equation, but it's not the only thing that we look at. Michael Rehaut : That's helpful. And it's good to clarify because obviously, sometimes the first-time parcels are faster turning and kind of get into the system a little quicker, so thanks for that. Secondly, the community count, going back to that for a moment, obviously solid results this year. How should we think about 2017 in terms of, obviously, what you have in the pipeline and kind of your plans? Should we expect a similar type of 10% to 15% rate or perhaps like some of your peers slowing down a little bit to high single digits? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah, Mike. It\u2019s Bob. We haven't given any color on 2017 yet. We will give that when we release our fourth quarter earnings. Michael Rehaut : Okay. Directionally, do you want to make a pass or just wait until next quarter? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, we will wait for the fourth quarter. Michael Rehaut : All right. Fair enough. Thanks. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Ken Zener at KeyBanc. Ken Zener : Good morning, gentlemen. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Ken. How are you? Ken Zener : Doing well. Ryan thank you very much and -- for your comments. It sounds like you're going to have a different communication approach in terms of your comment specifically around gross margins, which is what I want to explore. It did sound like you're taking those down near term. You haven't given guidance on FY 2017, but the implication seems to be that fourth quarter would have some insight into FY 2017. Now, unlike past cycles you're not able to recover the land or the labor components. Can you talk if that -- how much if that's playing a part of it as opposed to perhaps kind of the regional mix that your -- or pressure that you're seeing? For example, I believe Florida is still your highest margin segment, but that one is down even though demand is good. Just kind of talk about how the regional EBIT is impacting that comment around gross margins coming down? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Ken, here's what I would tell you, I mean we're certainly cycling through newer land that is more expensive and that's a drag on our margins. On top of that, you know, it's widely known that labor is increasing both on the material and specifically on the labor side. We gave you a little bit of color commentary around what we're anticipating in terms of cost increases. So I think those are the -- those are the things that are impacting our forward margins not regional differences Ken Zener : Sorry. Go ahead. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Ken, just to clarify we did give a view towards 2017 which is consistent with that fourth quarter 20.5%, 21% margin. Again, what we'll do is we'll give you color as we go quarter-by-quarter depending on how the year plays out. But based on what we're seeing today that fourth quarter projections actually is through 2017. Ken Zener : Okay. I think that's -- gentlemen, I think that's obviously a very good approach that you're taking. And obviously, there's implications I think to the extent you want to flush that out more by region because they're such different regional components. That will be useful over time, but thank you for giving us that guidance. Operator : We will go next to Ivy Zelman at Zelman and Associates. Ivy Zelman : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. With respect to the broad-based growth -- hi -- the broad-based growth that you experienced in the strong orders across your price segment was impressive and it's obviously very good and you chose the health of the market. Could you just help us walk through each of the segments on where -- maybe you're seeing an increase in selling incentives within your markets as you move up price point, if at all? Maybe just differing the various level of concessions in the markets that you're contending with, and what your strategy around margin versus volume -- or volume at the expense of margin, if you give us your thoughts around that? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Ivy, it\u2019s Ryan. I think the easiest way to look at it frankly is that discounts remain relatively flat with where they were in the prior quarter. We did not see a material change. As Bob mentioned in some of his comments they are running right around $10,000 a unit which we think is very reasonable. Certainly in some of the move-up price points things have gotten to be a little bit more difficult and we have seen, you know, accelerating demand on the first-time buyer which I think is reflective of some of the comments that I gave to you about where a lot of our land investment when in the third quarter Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: And Ivy, one of the things I would add to that is as we look at the business and we don't necessarily look at it regionally or by segment the way you talk about it. But we've invested a fair amount of money over the last couple years and we are focused on getting return out of that investment. So our absorption paces we were pleased with them. They were consistent with what we've seen over the last year or so. And the margins are still really strong on it. We're guiding down a little bit -- to the Ryan's points it's a little bit harder to get price -- margins a little bit harder to come by, but at these margins, you know, you'll see us continue to sell to actually realize the return on investment. It is really important to remember it it's not just margin, margin and pace how quickly can we work through it. We made good investments. We like the margins we're getting from them and we like the return we can get if we can keep continue to sell against that. And so we're playing in the market. So you can see year-over-year we've got a little bit of creep in our discounts, that's almost community by community though, what open nearby what our competitors up to. But we want to make sure we do is take all the money that we have invested and get the return out of it. Ivy Zelman : No, Bob, that's extremely helpful. So, it's really a focus on return and getting that pace and getting your money back basically, which is different than other builders. So I think it's important that people understand that strategy and I appreciate the follow-up on that. Thanks, guys. Good luck. Ryan Marshall : You know, Ivy, the only other thing that I'd add to your last comment there is that that's really what's at the heart of the Value Creation strategy from the very beginning was a focused on return on investment. Ivy Zelman : Great. Thanks, Ryan. Good luck with everything. Operator : We will go next to Stephen East at Wells Fargo. Stephen East : Thank you. Ryan, first of all, congratulations on the CEO role. And just -- could you expand a bit as you prepared -- in your prepared comments, you talked about the vision for the company and operational changes, your land bank, et cetera, could you give us maybe a little bit more detail on how you're thinking about it? How long may be some of your plans take to implement, et cetera? Just whatever things you've been grinding through since you've taken over? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Stephen we haven't provided any details and I probably wouldn't want to get into it today in terms of, you know, specifics around implementation. What I'll -- what I will elaborate on as I did in some of my prepared remarks is that I am a very big supporter of our Value Creation strategy. The company has realized great financial benefits from that strategy and will continue -- we're going to continue to run that play book. My experiences in the operations of our organization over the last 15 years are certainly a little bit different, unique from Richard's and you'll see heavy emphasis and focus from me is the leader of our organization on driving the efficiencies out of our home building operations.  That's where we made substantial -- both substantial and sizable gains over the last four to five years and becoming a more efficient builder. I believe that we can continue to drive that well into the future. The other piece that I talked about is just being more balanced in terms of where we're investing our land we are brand agnostic and we've talked about that quite a bit. We have an entry-level first-time of business today and will continue to have that business well into the future with our Centex, Pulte, and Del Web brand construct. I am quite encouraged by the fact that we are becoming more balanced than what we've been as represented by the, you know, 40% of our land acquisitions in the third quarter going to the first-time buyer. Stephen East : Okay. Great. And just a quick compound question, if you will. Bob, could you tell us the way you all define returns, tell us where you are now? And maybe what type of longer term target you all have out there? And then as you look at buying back shares, I guess a couple quick message -- a couple of mixed messages. You want to get to investment grade, but you have added significant debt and with the equity trading at 1.5 times book, how do you reconcile that versus land opportunities, et cetera? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: I guess Stephen for to the second question investment grade, what we've said is that we think we are behaving like an investment grade credit we have over time. We have strong credit metric new offering that we did in July I think are directly supportive of that view. What we said as we won't jump through hoops to try and get somebody to say that we're investment grade. So I think, you know, we were running a very, I think disciplined and healthy capital structure. So within that we've laid out for the last couple of years what we're going to do with our capital including to buy back shares, and I apologize I forgot the first question. Ryan Marshall : Returns? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Returns, sure. Well, if you look at our returns over the last couple of years what they've been is relatively flat as we've grown the income statement, but we're growing our investment at the same time. Going forward I think yeah we've highlighted that we would be not growing at the same rate in terms of investment, but that we can do expect to be able to yield return on the investment of making. So I think feel the improvement there. And what I think you can expect from us is later this year to layout sort of what we think the target might be over time. Operator : We will go next to John Lovallo at Bank of America. John Lovallo : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call as well. Ryan Marshall : Hi, John. John Lovallo : Hi, good morning. First question would be, Bob, you guys laid out 20.5% to 21% gross margin and you talked about SG&A as a percentage of sales at around 9%. It would seem to imply that there's a decent chance that operating margin can be flattish to actually down next year. I know you're not giving explicit guidance, but directionally, am I thinking about that correctly? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: So, I think, you know, I don't want to be pithy, but the math is the math. Again, we think the margins are strong. We think the operating margin will be strong. And what we're trying to do is manage just like Ryan talk about we're managing against return is the total return of our income stream that's really important to us and we certainly seek to maximize gross margin. We are trying to be as efficient as we possibly can all with a goal for striving strong operating margin. And, again, not trying to be cute, that if you if you use 21% or 20.5% and 9% that's still a strong relative operating margin compared to historical norms. John Lovallo : Okay. That's helpful. And then just thinking about the cycle here, I mean, growth is arguably -- or the rate of growth, I should say, is arguably decelerating on an industry-wide basis. Your first-time community seemed like they won't be up and running until 2018. I guess what is it that gives you guys confidence that the buyers are going to be there and that the market is still going to hold in? Ryan Marshall : John, I think a couple things here. Don't lose sight of the fact that we've got a very healthy first-time business today and we have for a number of years. This isn't a new -- this isn't a new focus for us. We certainly are seeing additional opportunities as of late and we've allocated some incremental capital toward that space and we will continue to realize the benefits from the business that we've always had there in addition to the more recent investment. So that would be the first piece of it. The other piece in terms of kind of overall demand we like where the housing market is quite a bit. When you look at overall new home sales this year somewhere in the 575,000 600,000 range we believe we're still under historical norms and historical equilibriums and with an economy that is healthy and low interest rates, low supply we see demand still being quite favorable and we liked how that shapes up for our business John Lovallo : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : We will go next to Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much, guys and let me also say I really appreciate the detail you guys have given. And I agree with you also, Bob, about your operating margin being pretty good where it is already. In that vein, I wanted to ask you for a little bit of clarity about your land spend. First of all, I don't think I got the development numbers, if you can just give a -- the specific, what the land spend was in the quarter? And then with respect to this 40% of the spend that was on first-time buyers in the quarter, can you help us understand, how much of this stuff is the land that you're buying, is what you might consider a stereotypical -- stereotypically located first-time community more sort of out in the outer fringe versus maybe some of the stuff that's a little closer in, maybe different kind the first-time buyer community? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah, Stephen, again a couple questions there, but LD in the quarter was $374 million total spend with 640 when you add into 266 of land acquisition. That brings us to for the year to about $1.9 billion and that excludes Wieland, so pretty much right on track with the $1.2 billion that we have projected for full year 2015. And then to your question on that first-time buyer, yeah, we've been pretty clear that we're not out in the excerpts chasing volume in that space. So we are typically going to be a little bit closer and we're typically going to be a little bit higher price point that more affluent millennial first-time buyer who's a little bit older partnered, might have two incomes. So I don't think we have changed at all what we express that first-time business means to us. It's just that with the acceleration of that business, we're seeing more opportunities to invest. And so of the approvals and that's not necessarily cash flow, that's just approvals so the cash will be spent at some point in the future you're seeing more than that in that first-time space. Stephen Kim : Got it. Okay. That's helpful clarification. Thanks for that. And then the second question I had related to your gross margin commentary. Obviously, a lot of things embedded in your outlook for 2017. I am sure some of the folks have touched on some of those. I wanted to see if you could comment a little bit specifically on two, however. One is what you're seeing in lumber? We've seen the random lengths have moved up pretty noticeably. I was wondering if that is factored into your thinking. Also, the Fair Labor Standards Act seems to have the potential to raise labor cost for sort of lesser skilled laborers who have to put in more than 40 hours in a given week, and then you had alluded to Hurricane Matthew possible delays. Is any of that embedded in your outlook in 4Q 2016? Thanks. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, you know, Stephen, for the fourth quarter and even for next year it is our best estimate today. So it encompasses everything we know. I think the reality is that Matthew is more likely a production and cost issue. Time will tell about on the labor side, but the folks that are working on the power lines aren't the folks that are building our home, so it's not an absolute labor issue, it's just will we be able to get power turned on. Ryan Marshall : And Stephen the other thing that -- this is Ryan -- and the other thing that I had mentioned about Hurricane Matthew we actually -- we feel quite fortunate that there wasn't a huge human -- a factor of human damage as a result of storm. Our employees are safe. The majority of the residents that live in the affected areas came through the storm safely. Our properties in particular fared quite well. We had minimal damage. It's mostly some landscape type clean up that we're going to be dealing. Bob mentioned the power companies, there's a lot of work that they've got to do to restore the existing infrastructure. And what will see likely happen based on past experience and I lived in Florida for a long time I am quite familiar with what happens post-hurricane storms as they rebuild infrastructure new meter sets and getting news new communities energized will take last priority. We do believe that we've factored the best information into our Q4 estimates that we can. But as you can certainly appreciate we don't have total visibility into what the backlog is for the power companies. Operator : We will go next to Susan Maklari with UBS. Susan Maklari : Good morning. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Susan. Susan Maklari : First off, you talked a lot about the longer-term trends in terms of SG&A and getting set targeted 9% level next year. But it seems like you also made a bit of progress this quarter relative to where we were. Can you just talk a little bit about the benefits maybe that you're already starting to see from some of the changes that you've made? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Susan, this is Ryan. When we -- at the end of our Q2 call we talked about -- we've got targeted run rate of 10% in 2016, we're going to reduce that by a 100% or 100 basis points going to a targeted run rate of 9% in 2017 and any of the actions that we plan to take toward that target would be taken in the third quarter. Bob laid out some of the details of how we have affected that and how we've effectuated that rather. We are already seeing the benefits of that and feel that we are very much on track toward that target of 9% for 2017. But to be put a finer point on it, yes we are already a benefit -- benefiting from the actions that we've taken. Susan Maklari : Okay. And then perhaps slightly bigger picture, recognizing that it's a perhaps a -- or is a very different election cycle than what we've seen historically. But can you talk a little bit to any impact that has on consumer psyche or demand as we get closer to the election and perhaps maybe the DC markets, specifically, but even just broader thoughts? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Susan. My experience from spending a number of years in the field in our operations is anytime we're this close to the end of an election cycle. I think the general public is trying to calculate and figure out what the impact will be of a change in power moving from one side of the political power grid to the other. What that will do to their earning power potential? What that will do to job growth? What that will do to the stock market, et cetera? My general sense is that folks maybe pause and wait and see. We actually -- as you saw from our sign-up growth in our absorption paces, we're quite happy -- very happy, in fact, with what we saw in the third quarter. So, I don't know that we saw any kind of noticeable impacts. I think I probably speak for the collective country and say I think it will be nice once this election cycle is over in a few short weeks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Megan McGrath at MKM Partners. Megan McGrath : Good morning. I guess my first question is sort of a chicken versus egg question. You mentioned a little bit in one of your answers before about being generally product agnostic, although it's certainly -- although you talked about going to 40% and it sounds like you're -- Ryan is excited about that. So, I guess, are you starting to talk about getting more diversified because you saw that your underwriting was pushing these first-time buyers or was there something proactive you did in your underwriting to shift towards the first-time buyer in the last couple of months? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Susan -- the way that I would answer that is we don't necessarily want to be over indexed toward any one specific buyer. I think what you heard in my prepared remarks is that we'd like to run a balanced business. We feel that we have that today. We'd like to continue to ensure that we have it. And what you'll see overtime is that as there are opportunities with a particular buyer group, you may see our spend flex ever so slightly towards that particular buyer group. And as we've seen a recovery with that first-time buyer, paces have been accelerating. I think that you've seen us spend a little bit more money toward that opportunity. On the whole though when we look at the entire enterprise, the goal is going to be maintain balance. Megan McGrath : So, you didn't really shift anything in your underwriting criteria in the quarter to purposely go after more first-time buyers? Ryan Marshall : No, we did not. Our underwriting criteria has stayed the same. Megan McGrath : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up on the SG&A. Are you done with the bulk of the low hanging fruit there or is there still more to come? Ryan Marshall : We're done. We're going to -- we'll always work to be as efficient as we possibly can, but all of the actions that we plan to take, we have taken. And we're done. Megan McGrath : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll go next to Jack Micenko with SIG. Jack Micenko : Hey, good morning, everybody. Bob, I wanted talked about the G&A number versus the percentage. You took about 350 FTEs out of the mix. You did a 183 number, so I back out the 12 in one-time items, we're back to sort of like a 165 kind of number. I think in the past, you've talked about 160, 165 run rate. I guess the question is, does that number come down from here going forward or how do we think about the dollar level of G&A? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Jack, there's variability based on volume, right. And so I don't want to start hanging targets on dollar levels. What we've indicated is 9% revenues for next year will be -- our projection is 10% for this year, and we think we'll get there. So, rather than turning it into an X dollar per quarter, because there are -- while many of our costs are relatively fixed over time, because sales commissions aren't in SG&A. There are model and start-up cost that comes through the SG&A line in connection with opening new communities. And so it really does flex and I don't want to put unrealistic or bad targets out. So, the 9% is where we'd like you think about. Jack Micenko : Okay. And then in the financial services business, the capture rate looks kind of in line, but it looks like you did a much better margin there. Is there anything different about the mortgage business over the last quarter that would have driven that? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: No, it's -- I mean its -- candidly its mostly volume-drive. We're operating in an environment where we have pretty strong margins today and have with little fits and starts over the last few years, been operating in a pretty strong margin environment. Our team does a great job, take captive lender so they're working with our customers. We seek to be competitive on price and so we are out there battling against all the other originators. They do a fantastic job and the margin environment has been pretty good. Operator : And we'll go next to Buck Horne at Raymond James. Buck Horne : Hey, good morning, guys. Ryan Marshall : Hey Buck. Buck Horne : A little bit of color on the geographic mix of where you're making new land investments right now in terms of just where you are thinking you would want to allocate more dollars regionally or by state? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: It\u2019s Bob. We go through a process annually that we update, candidly, quarterly, where we look at the capital allocation and we give our field teams three years of visibility in terms of what their expectation can be for capital availability and candidly, we are buyer everywhere. We certainly look to demand and demographic considerations when we think about it. We think about the team's historical ability to get money invested where they are indexed. To Ryan's point about balanced business, obviously, if you look at Texas and Dallas, in particular, we've committed a lot of capital there because the market is so strong. But on the whole, there are no markets where we're saying, you don't get capital and there's none where we said you get twice as much as you used to. Buck Horne : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. Curious about John Wieland as well. Just -- maybe how you would evaluate that segment performance so far? And maybe you gave this earlier, I was curious about what the change in the move-up segment absorption pace was without the effective Wieland? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Buck, it\u2019s Ryan. And I would tell you thus far we're very pleased with the John Wieland acquisition and the related integration efforts. Our team frankly has done a phenomenal job in bringing the Wieland platform onto our platform and we're quite happy with the results that we're getting there. And it's in line with our underwriting criteria. One of the things that we really look to with that acquisition was margin opportunity by becoming more efficient on the cost side and we're continuing to work through that. When -- as to your absorption comment, ex-Wieland, our move-up absorptions were flat. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jay McCanless at Wedbush. Jay McCanless : Hi. My questions have been answered. Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Thanks Jay. Operator : We'll go next to Will Randow at Citigroup. Will Randow : Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Will. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hi, Will. Will Randow : In terms of the price increases and absorption paces you've mentioned for the three segments first-time, move-up, and active adult, can you talk about the absolute price increases as opposed to -- I'm not -- I don't believe you excluded out mix or I don't know if you can quantify that or qualify that? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Sorry, those are absolute increases, though I'm not sure I understand your question. Will Randow : Okay. I wanted to make sure that was the case and then my follow-up was, if you're seeing that type of strength in move-up relative to the two other segments, what is driving your emphasis towards the first-time buyer? I know you highlighted a few different comments there, but I would love to hear a little bit more detail in terms of -- Ryan Marshall : Yes, Will, I just -- I probably just want to clarify the comment. We're -- the focus is on running a balanced business and we're going to get over-indexed toward any one particular buyer group. We like the recovery that we're seeing the first-time buyer. They were noticeably absent in this recovery, as this recovery was predominately led by the move-up buyer. And I think as the economy and frankly, the housing recovery cycle has continued to progress, we're seeing strength from the first-time buyers and thus additional opportunities for us to put capital to work. As Bob highlighted in detail, our strategy has been to stay closer to the job core, closer to the city center. We're not going into the [Indiscernible] and chasing volume for volume sakes. So, well, we like what we're seeing and we're seeing opportunities to be a little bit more balanced and how we're allocating capital. You won't see us become over-indexed toward any one buyer group. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Weintraub at Buckingham Research. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. It's actually just a clarification. There has been a question earlier on operating margins given what you've indicated on SG&A and preliminarily on gross margin. I just want to make sure that I understand because I believe given your 4Q guidance in gross margin that your gross margin in 2016 is going to be about 21.2% or 21.3%. And if that's right, then I believe if you're going to be reducing SG&A by 100 basis points, then if you're going to be in that 20.5% to 21% range for gross margin preliminarily for 2017, that actually indicates a modest increase in operating margin. I just want to make sure I wasn't missing something. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: You're not. That is the math, Mark. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Michael Rehaut at JP Morgan. Michael Rehaut : Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted to point of clarification and also just a little bit more color perhaps on the gross margin. First off, there was an earlier question that kind of talked to the potential, with the guidance for 2017 operating margins to be down year-over-year, and I don't quite see that math per se, if you're doing -- if you're guiding to 20.5% to 21% growth and 9% SG&A. That kind of gets you in the high 11% on an operating margin basis. I just want to make sure that I'm not missing anything there. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, your math is correct. Michael Rehaut : Okay. And then just secondly, when thinking about the 2017 gross margin and certainly, appreciate the guidance there, of course. I was just wondering if you can give a little more granularity in terms of how to think about interest expense amortization, Bob? And aside from that, when you think about the -- it looks like you're going to do in the low 21s for full year 2016, what would be the bigger drivers of the incremental contraction labor versus land? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, so interest like we obviously have borrowed an incremental roughly billion dollars during the year. So, our interest cost is up. We don't think it will have a significant impact on the gross margin percentage because that's going to be against the bigger base of business. So, we think it\u2019s relatively neutral 2016 to 2017. In terms of the color comment, we are in the midst doing our planning right. And so we can give you a little bit more color on that when we provide a fresh update for -- candidly our real estimate -- not real, sorry, our budget base estimate for 2017. Operator : And we will take our final question from Alex Barron at Housing Research Center. Alex Barron : Yes. Thank you. I know you guys indicated an interest in lowering the number of years' exposure to active adults. But I'm wondering if you guys are changing anything to do that such as I don't know, increasing the number of actually active adult communities or lowering your size of homes or something to increase absorptions. Can you just elaborate your thoughts on the active adult space? Ryan Marshall : Alex, this is Ryan. We're just not as -- we're not investing at the same rate that we were previously in the active adult space. You're also seeing the overall size of the communities come down and be a little bit smaller. If you look historically some of our Delaware communities were 2,000, and 3,000, and 4,000 homes per community and that simply gotten smaller over time. So, that would be the primary driver of brining the average years of supply down. They are just simply smaller communities. We\u2019re very big believers in the active adult space. It\u2019s a huge consumer group. We have an unbelievably strong brand with the Delaware brand and we're going to continue to play in that space with that particular consumer. Alex Barron : Okay, great. Thanks. Ryan Marshall : Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Zeumer for any closing remarks. James Zeumer : Great. I want to thank everybody for your time this morning. We'll be around all day if you any follow-up questions. And we look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead sir. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Eric and good morning. I want to welcome you to PulteGroup's conference call to discuss our fourth quarter financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Joining me here for today's call are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; James Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today's calls have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We'll also post an audio replay of today's call a little later today. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings including our annual and quarterly reports. With that said, now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Jim and good morning. I\u2019m extremely pleased with you this morning about PulteGroup\u2019s strong operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. At the outset of the housing recovery, we explained our focus on improving the company\u2019s fundamental business performance and overall returns on invested capital. As our business and financial metrics improved, we then discussed the opportunity to systematically increase our land investment, which we did beginning later in 2013. Then headed in to 2016, we talked about the year being an inflexion point for the company, as our increased land investment would begin delivering higher growth. As our financial results indicate, 2016 was indeed that inflexion point as we realized a meaningful expansion of our business. On a year-over-year basis, PulteGroup reported 13% growth in unit sign-ups to 20,326 homes, while closing volume increased 16% to just shy of 20,000 homes, benefiting from a 10% increase in ASP for the year, home sale revenues increased 29% to $7.5 billion and perhaps mostly importantly our reported earnings increased 29% to $1.75 per share.  While growth is important, it is worth highlighting that consistent with our focus on creating value for our shareholders, the significant growth in our business was achieved while continuing to deliver high returns on invested capital and equity.  Clearly 2016 was a year of exceptional performance and progress for the company, and has us well positioned for continued success in 2017 and beyond. While 2016 was an inflexion point in the growth trajectory and performance of our business. We expect 2017 to be another outstanding year as we continue to realize benefits from prior year investments.  It is important to remember though that we are seeking to build a business that consistently generates higher returns on invested capital over the housing cycle. As such, we will continue to stress running a balanced business. As I explained on our last earnings call, I see opportunities for us to realize a better balance across the buyer groups we serve.  In 2016, roughly 43% of our deliveries were to move up buyers which reflect increased investment in that segment in prior years. Going forward, there may be opportunities for us to diversify and expand our business among first time and active adult buyers, where the huge booking generations of the millennials and boomers will influence demand for years to come.  Our emphasis on building for the move-up buyer has served us extremely well during the initial leg of the housing recovery. But we want to make sure we aren\u2019t missing opportunities that would allow us to further broaden and grow our business while diversifying risk. Consistent with this idea of being balanced, our goal is to drive high rates of return, by properly managing the key inputs of sales pace, margin and inventory turns.  We have done a tremendous job improving our margin since 2011, now we have to make sure we are effectively turning our assets in support of delivering high returns by maintaining the right sale and construction pace. Critical to delivering high returns is that we remain disciplined in our land investment practices and work to be increasingly efficient in managing our land inventories.  We have talked often about the 13 point risk waiting criteria that we used to underwrite every deal. By consistently underwriting projects with returns in excess of 20% as measured by the scale, we can further improve returns and lower our overall risk profile. This risk based approach is now deeply embedded in our operating philosophy and we will continue to do it here to these underwriting guidelines in the future.  As we think about delivering consistent, long-term returns, it\u2019s not just about what projects we are investing in, but how we are investing in those projects. We are actively looking for opportunities to control more land via option. In 2016, 42% of the lots we approved were initially controlled under some form of option agreement, allowing us to be more efficient with our capital while helping to lower overall risks. Beyond the what and the how of the projects we invest in, is the how much capital we chose to invest.  We\u2019ve talked about previously several years of 30% plus compound annual growth in our land spend has meaningfully improved our land pipeline. As such, we were able to materially slow the growth of investment going forward, while still expanding our business. We currently expect land acquisition spend in 2017 to be approximately $1.1 billion, which comparable to our 2016 investment ex John Wieland.  Given our prior investments, we are in a position to deliver additional volume growth in 2017. We also expect to realize even higher returns on invested capital, given plans to moderate the rate of land spend, increase the use of land options where possible and accelerate our inventory turns.  In 2017, I also expect to take additional steps in our work to raise the bar on construction quality and customer experience even higher. Though it can be difficult to quantify, I believe improving the products and experience we deliver can over time enhance sales, improve revenues and decrease future warranty costs. As such, it is an opportunity that we continue to pursue.  Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Bob? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks Ryan and good morning. Our Q4 results represent the completion of an outstanding year for the company, as we realized significant gains throughout our business and resulting financial performance. Consistent with Ryan\u2019s comments of 2016 being an inflexion year in terms of realizing higher growth, our fourth quarter home sale revenues increased 21% to $2.4 billion. A higher revenue in the quarter reflects a 9% increase in closings to 6,197 homes, along with an 11% increase in average selling price to $391,000. Our Q4 conversion rate at 66% was slightly above last year and our prior guidance for the quarter. Our ability to close additional homes reflects a number of factors including our decision to selectively start more spec production earlier in the year, the efforts we\u2019ve made to strengthen our trade base and perhaps most importantly the hard work of all of our employees. We\u2019re certainly pleased with the steady progress made towards being more efficient in converting our construction pipeline in 2016, but labor resources are still tight across many of our markets. As such, we\u2019ll continue our strategy of selectively including spec units as we plan our product pipeline to help develop a more even construction case. With all this in mind, we currently expect our first quarter conversion rate to be comparable to Q1 of last year.  Looking at the mix of our fourth quarter closings, 30% was first time, 43% was move up and 27% active adult. This is consistent with last year, when the closing break down was 31% first time, 40% move-up and 29% active adults.  As I mentioned, our revenue also benefitted from the 11% increase in our average sales price this quarter. The higher average sales price reflects the ongoing shift in the mix of homes or buildings coupled with higher prices realized in each of our buyer groups. In fact, our ASPs were up 20% to $301,000 for our first time buyers up 9% to $464,000 for our move-up buyers and up 6% to $374,000 for our active adult buyers.  The large increase in average sale price for first time buyers was driven primarily by mix, as we realized a large increase in homes closed in California which as you would expect carry much higher prices relative to the rest of the country.  With our backlog ASP up 8% over the last year to $296,000, and given the mix of communities we plan to open over the course of 2017, we expect our ASP will continue to move higher through \u201917 and is likely to average above $400,000 for the full year.  Before I address our gross margins, I\u2019d like to cover a change in the way we are classifying sales commissions. As we highlighted in our press release, we\u2019ve elected to re-classify both internal and external sales commissions from home sales cost of revenues to SG&A. This adjustment makes our income statement presentation more consistent with the majority of our home building fears and we believe is responsive to some of the questions and feedback we\u2019ve received over the years.  To assist in your analysis we are posting three years of financial results to our website, each is adjust to reflect the new classifications. Having said that our reported home sale gross margin for the fourth quarter was 24.8%, the comparable prior year fourth quarter gross margin was 27.1%.  Consistent with comments we\u2019ve made on prior earnings calls, margins continue to be impacted by higher land costs as we are turning over almost one-third of our communities each year, as well as labor costs which are continuing to increase across many of our markets.  Looking at the year ahead, we continue to target full year 2017 gross margins of 24% to 24.5% likely still the highest in the industry, as we continue to benefit from operational changes we made as part of our value creation work. Just to be clear, this range is the same as the guidance we gave previously related to 2017 margins, simply adjusted to reflect our reclassification of commissions in to SG&A. That being said, given our current estimate for house cost to increase by 1.5% to 2% as well as potential impacts related to affordability due to rising interest rates, we anticipate being towards the low end of guidance range.  Turning upon the demographic and geographic mix of homes closed in a given period, reported quarterly gross margin could range from 23.5% to 25% with Q1 expected to be the low quarter of the year.  Our gross margins continue to be supported by our focus on maximizing loss premiums and option revenues. In fact, total options revenue and loss premiums gained 7% over last year to approximately $73,000 per closing. However, sales discounts of 3.2% or $12,500 per home while still modest, did increase 40 basis points sequentially and 90 basis points over the fourth quarter of last year.  Our reported fourth quarter SG&A including commissions, totaled $208 million or 8.6% of home sale revenues. This includes the benefit of $55 million relating to the reversal of construction related reserves realized in the quarter.  Comparable prior year SG&A spend was $210 million or 10.5% of home sale revenues which included a $30 million benefit from a similar reversal of constructed related insurance reserves. Adjusting for the reclassification of commissions and consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our full year 2017 SG&A to be approximately 12.5% of revenues. As a result, we continue to expect our full year 2017 operating margin to be in the range of 11.5% to 12%.  Turning to our Financial Services businesses, we reported pre-tax income of $25 million in the fourth quarter as the operations benefited from the increase in homebuilder closing volumes. This compares to $29 million last year, which included a benefit of $12 million resulting from a reversal of mortgage repurchase reserves.  Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 82% compared with 83% last year. In the aggregate, we reported fourth quarter pre-tax income of $414 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year. For the quarter, the company reported a $141 million of income tax expense, representing an effective tax rate of 34%. The company\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than its previous guidance of 38% due to the recognition of energy efficient home credits, as well as a deferred tax benefit related to a legal entity restructuring.  While we\u2019re around the topic of taxes, I\u2019d like to note that we currently expect to fully utilize our remaining federal net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in 2017. As a result, we expect to become a federal cash tax payer on a portion of our taxable earnings in 2017.  As we become a cash tax payer, we can take advantage of the section 199 manufacturing deduction which we expect will decrease effective 2017 tax rate by approximately 1.5%. As a result, we expect our 2017 full year tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. It is important to note that everything we\u2019ve outlined for 2017 assumes that no corporate tax reform takes place. Like all tax payers, we\u2019re paying close attention to dialog related to possible changes to the federal tax laws. The timing and specific language associated with any tax reform is critical to calculating the potential impacts on our cash flows and the value of our deferred tax assets. As such we have to wait to see the actual legislative before determining future impacts. Closing out the review of our income statement, net income for the quarter was $273 million or $0.83 per share, which includes $0.16 per share of insurance and tax benefits realized in the quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share are calculated using approximately 328 million shares, which is decrease of approximately 7% from 2015, resulting primarily from share repurchase activity.  Moving to our balance sheet, we finished the quarter with $723 million of cash. During the quarter, we spent $252 million to repurchase 13.2 million shares at an average price of $19.07 per share. For the full year, the company spent $600 million to repurchase 30.9 million shares or 8.8% of its outstanding shares. As previously announced, the company plans to repurchase an additional $1 billion of its common shares in 2017. The timing of planned repurchases will be driven in part by the normal seasonal cash flows of the business and subject to overall business and financial market conditions.  Our year-end debt-to-cap was 40% which is within the 30% to 40% range in which we seek to operate. Depending upon the timing of future share repurchases we may move above 40%, but expected future earnings should work to quickly de-lever our overall cash structure.  Let me finish with a few details on our homebuilding operations. At the end of the quarter, we had a total 7,486 homes under construction which is an increase 15% over last year. Consistent with our strategy to use specs to better maintain our production levels, specs with 31% of year-end homes under construction which is consistent with last year. We ended the quarter with 645 finished specs, as we continue to average less than one finished spec per community.  For the fourth quarter, we generated 4,202 sign-ups which is an increase of 15% over Q4 of last year. On a dollar basis, sign-ups were up 22% to $1.7 billion. Breaking down science by buyer group, sales to first time buyers gained 12% to 1,116 homes, while sign-ups to move up buyers increased 27% to 1,985 homes. Sign-ups to active adult buyers were 1% from last year and totaled 1,100 homes.  Our community count was up 17% in the fourth quarter to 726. Our community count growth was slightly ahead of our guidance due to the slower close-out of a few communities. As we did in 2016, we again expect turn over roughly one-third of our communities in 2017 and anticipate overall community count growth in the range of 5% to 10% for the year. Year-over-year growth in community should be fairly consistent between the front and back halves of the year.  Supporting this growth, the company continued to invest in the business approving roughly 6,000 per purchase during the quarter, including a replacement Del Webb community in Southern California. Excluding the 1,000 lots associated with this Del Webb position, our average deal size includes just over a hundred lots that we expect to have a duration of roughly 2.5 years from the time we open for sales. Consistent with the trends we have seen for the past several years, most of these lots will require development. However, we are pleased to see that over a third of the deals were option transactions allowing us to improve asset efficiency and reduce potential market risk. For the full year in 2016, we spent approximately $1.1 billion on land acquisition excluding the assets we purchased from John Wieland.  As Ryan mentioned, we expect our 2017 land acquisition spend to be approximately $1.1 billion, and we expect to increase our land development spend by approximately 10% to $1.6 billion At year-end, we owned approximately 99,000 lots while controlling another 44,000 lots via auction.  Based our trailing 12 month closing volumes, we\u2019ve lowered our owned lots supplied to less than five years. Our goal is to continue to shorten the duration of our land pipeline by continuing to focus our investment on smaller, faster turning communities, while continuing to work down our large legacy Del Webb communities.  We ended 2016 with a strong land pipeline that can support ongoing growth in 2017. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, as we seek to open upwards of [250] new communities in 2017, we have the required land and are optimistic better opportunities heading in to the selling season.  Now let me turn the call over to Ryan for some final comments on market conditions. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Bob. Fourth quarter and full year 2016 results for PulteGroup and the overall US housing market point to continued growth in housing demand. After several years of strong job formations and low unemployment, supported by favorable demographics, there are signs that housing demand is now being bolstered by an improving economy and recent gains in consumer sentiments. Against this increasingly positive background, we are mindful that interest rates have been rising over the past couple of months. However, coming off such a low starting point, it is certainly reasonable to expect that housing demand can continue to expand especially if the rise in rates truly reflects increased expansion of the US economy.  We are fortunate that the initial increase in rates took place during the seasonal slow point for housing sales. Buyer expectations have had time to adjust to these new market conditions, so expectations can be properly set as we head in to this spring selling season.  While it is challenging to assess buyer sentiment during the slower winter months, we believe higher rates have so far had minimal impact on demand. We will obviously have a better read on the buyer as we move through the first two quarters of the year. But based on Q4 results, we are optimistic heading in to 2017.  Specific to the fourth quarter, market conditions were generally consistent, albeit at seasonally lower volumes, with the trends experienced earlier in the year. In the east, demand conditions in Florida and up through the southeast generally remained positive. Demand in Florida remained strong, although our results for the quarter were a little choppy given the timing of community close-outs and openings. I would add that our results showed consistent improvement as the quarter progressed. We realized improved year-over-year sales volumes in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, but still view these as very competitive where we\u2019ve had to battle for each sale particularly in DC.  Demand in the middle third of the country remained strong in the quarter, as our Mid-West and Texas operations both posted year-over-year sign-up increases exceeding 20%. Houston was particularly in the quarter, and given the recent gains in the price of oil 2017 could see a sustained recovery in demand.  And finally, looking out west demand conditions were favorable although we experienced some volatility as we move from week to week from the quarter. It is only got stronger as we move through the quarter, while northern Cal slowed a little. That being said, our divisions have a positive view heading in to 2017.  While we are only a few weeks into the new year, we are pleased with the overall demand conditions which suggest that higher rates are not dampening buyer interest and that 2017 can be another year of growth for the industry. Given the good start we are seeing, we are excited to get in to this spring selling season. Let me close by thanking all employees of PulteGroup. You helped grow the business the right way in 2016 by remaining focused on building a great home and delivering an outstanding customer experience. Together we can look forward to an even bigger and better 2017.  Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? Jim Zeumer : Thank you Ryan. Just reinforcing Bob\u2019s message, you can find the historical financial results on our website in the financial information section under the investor relations tab. With that said, we\u2019ll open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining term of the call. We ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Eric if you\u2019ll explain the process, we\u2019ll get started with Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] we\u2019ll take our first quarter from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Nishu Sood : I wanted to ask first about the impressive ASP growth, certainly ahead of your peers in the past couple of quarters. And Bob you were talking about how we should expect that to continue in \u201917. You talked about entry level, the mix shift to California. Just wanted to get a sense of how did that effect on the fourth quarter? Just want to understand the drivers of the ASP growth across the divisions or maybe even regionally? What\u2019s going to drive it to stay above 400 in \u201917? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah Nishu, I think it\u2019s a couple of things. Mix matter geographically, so certainly in the fourth quarter this year what drove some of the increase was heavier concentration of California [closures] where prices are higher. In terms of going forward, it\u2019s a continued mix shift to some degree. We obviously over the last three or four years invested a great deal on the move-up space that has a higher average sales price. As we mentioned in the fourth quarter it was $464,000. So as you see more of those communities opening, you\u2019ll see the price mix higher. And again as you saw this year, sort of a sequential increase quarter-over-quarter, our expectation is you\u2019ll see the same thing in 2017. Nishu Sood : On the share buybacks, the $250 million a quarter, obviously you\u2019ve been on track with that for 3Q and 4Q. As we look out across \u201917 and other that\u2019s coming in to a little bit clear view, how do you expect that to impact the balance sheet? You mentioned that you should be able to deleverage. Are these share repurchase you continue at this aggressive pace to the tune of $50 million. Is it going to be mostly internally funded?  Now you\u2019ve laid out first expectation for 2.7 billion in land spend. What should the debt-to-cap roughly look like by the end of the year and how is it going to be funded, mostly internally or will there need to be some additional debt raises? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Nishu, its Bob, I think what we\u2019ve highlighted is we\u2019d like to stay at or near that 40% rate. It\u2019s our belief that we can stay there, we\u2019ve talked about needing to maybe go outside that a little bit. It\u2019s much a function of buying down the equity makes the percentage just naturally accrete higher. But in terms of the cash flows of the business, yeah we like many in the industry have typically outflows in the first half of the year, as we build house and develop lots that we will deliver later in the year so the cash flow is skewed more heavily towards the back half of the year.  You and should expect us to have that impact the way we buy stock during the year, and so we\u2019ve talked about by the end of the year probably being low 40s in terms of debt-to-cap, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a significant need for liquidity. It will obviously depend total closings, cash flow generation, and profitability. But we think that within the construct of the capital structure today, we think we can manage through it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our next question is from John Lovallo with Bank of America. John Lovallo : The first question is the Midwest orders were notably stronger than we were for at least. Did you guys see any pickup in demand in some of the rust belt states that may have coincided with consumer confidence that was very strong post-election there? Ryan Marshall : John, its Ryan, thanks for the question. We continue to like the strength of our business in the Midwest. We\u2019ve got excellent land positions there, we have very good operators, we have nice market share. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we did see a bump in consumer sentiment that I think certainly contributed to the strength in the year-over-year increases that we noted in the Midwest section. John Lovallo : And then order growth, it looks like it was largely driven by community count opening this quarter, and by our estimate absorptions what we know were down slightly. How are you guys thinking about the community count absorption mix in 2017? Ryan Marshall : As I think Bob mentioned John, we are expecting 5% to 10% growth in 2017 that will be balanced throughout the year as we move through 2017. We noted that our year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter was 17% community count growth, which was slightly outside the range that we had previously provided, which was mostly been driven by the slow close-out of a few older communities. So we like the community count growth and we\u2019re also very positive about what our absorptions were in the quarter. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: So John the absorptions were actually, if you look at the straight calculation down a little bit. But if you exclude the Wieland communities which we\u2019ve talked about in the past being slow moving, we actually saw roughly 2% increase in absorptions and across the universe that was flattish on the entry level up 2% on move-up and up 5% on the active adult. So we did some growth there if you take out the impact of the slower moving Wieland communities. Operator : Next it\u2019s Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Michael Rehaut : Good morning every one and nice quarter, and I also have to say congrats on the commission reclassification. I guess if it wasn\u2019t known that I\u2019m a homebuilding nerd and I could be so excited about that, that this should put that to rest. And I encourage others, the few remaining builders to follow your lead.  My first question just going back to the sales pace a little bit, and wanted to understand some of your peers have had absorption pace improvement in fiscal \u201916. And you highlighted flat on first time and up 2% of move-ups. So just trying to get a sense of where the gap might be that some of your peers. Is it perhaps geographic, is it more of a pace versus price equation or if there is certain community mix driving that, because I do think that as its recovery progresses particularly on the first time side which we\u2019re seeing a little bit more activity, I\u2019d expect some of the pace improvement to be a little bit better everything else equal. Ryan Marshall : Hey Mike its Ryan. I\u2019ll take - there\u2019s a lot in that question, I\u2019ll take a couple of pieces of it and then we may have to come back and clean up some of the loose ends. We\u2019re very proud of the margins that we have and it\u2019s been part of our value creation strategy aimed at driving overall return on invested capital.  Certainly as I talk about in some of my prepared remarks, it\u2019s important to balance the pace and price equation, margins are one component of that making sure that we\u2019re continuing to turn our assets are also part of that component. But we like what\u2019s going on with our business. We\u2019re turning our assets, we\u2019ve got strong margins, we\u2019ve got strong profitability, we\u2019re growing our earnings. Those are all very good things for our investors and for our shareholder base and we like what we\u2019re seeing. Michael Rehaut : I guess second question just on the gross margins. I believe you said pre-reclassification that the margins that you\u2019re expecting in \u201917 are much closer to what you\u2019d consider longer term gross margins. So I just wanted to know, if I recall that correctly and if you still view that to be the case. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah, Mike its Bob. I don\u2019t think we characterize margins as being something that can be, correct my word fixed. They will move overtime, we\u2019ve enjoyed for the last several years really high margins we still do. The market will ultimately dictate where margins go from here. But we do think we\u2019re operating a little bit differently the way we are creating floor plans, the way we\u2019re underwriting our land transactions, should lend itself to continued strong margins. But it\u2019s important to remember; we underwrite through return and so as an example, the more option transactions we do could influence the margins, mix matters. The more entry level or first time business we do could influence margins. So, as Ryan said we feel very good about margin profile today. I don\u2019t want to say that it will be here forever though. Ryan Marshall : The other thing too Mike that I\u2019d add to Bob\u2019s comments there, we\u2019ve made real improvement in our SG&A leverage year-over-year or going to show about a 100 basis points of incremental leverage. When you combine a very strong margin profile with some added SG&A leverage, you get down to the operating margin line that we\u2019ve provided guidance of 11.5% to 12% also puts us in a very competitive spot within the peer side. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Bob Wetenhall : Ryan I just wanted to see if you could dig down a little bit in to the SG&A leverage. You kind of higher than the peer group, you obviously have a strong operational background. Are the changes you need to make on the SG&A side a cost management issue or is it just a function driving sales higher and extracting the leverage out of P&L? Ryan Marshall : Couple of things that I\u2019d point out, excluding the insurance benefit that we realized in Q4, we\u2019re forecasting lowering 2017 SG&A as a percent of revenue by about 100 basis points as I mentioned, and that\u2019s relative to 2016 . So we\u2019re on track to drive meaningful overhead leverage in the business in \u201917.  We talked in our last quarter earnings call, part of that was coming from peer growth in the business, part of that was coming from absolute cost reduction. As to your comment about our cost higher, we believe that part of the difference between us and some of our peers are the investments that we\u2019re making and delivering a superior product quality, as well as customer experience and we think that that\u2019s a differentiator for our company and frankly as part of our strategy, and we believe we get the benefit of that in higher gross margin.  So part of the reason you hear us talk about gross margins, SG&A leverage and then ultimately operating margins and looking at it in totality. What I would tell you about SG&A Bob is, SG&A discipline is going to be a focus of mine. We have continued room for leverage and it will be a focus of buying to go and get it, and we\u2019re proud of the progress we\u2019re making, but I don\u2019t think - I know that\u2019s not where we\u2019re going to stop, so I\u2019ll leave it at that. Bob Wetenhall : Bob, it sounds like your gross margin guidance is towards the low end of the range and you also caught out the fact that you got this favorable mix shift towards California which is driving our [ASP], and I\u2019m just trying to understand inside the gross margin, are you seeing a lot of lot cost inflation and inflation on labor and materials, which is offsetting the favorable mix? What\u2019s the right way to think about gross margin? And perhaps I\u2019m wrong on this, maybe it\u2019s an issue versus like a shift to spec or something. Any clarity how to think about the next 12 months on gross margin would be great. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: I think the way you said at the start of that question is right. As we have cycled through, we\u2019re turning over a third of our asset base or a third of our community count each year and so the land that is feeding in to our cost of sales is increasing overtime. Certainly input costs are rising particularly labor, and so what you\u2019re seeing is, against the backdrop where non-mix adjusted pricing isn\u2019t increasing as rapidly as it was two or three years ago, we\u2019re feeling a little bit pressure because our input costs are going up a little bit faster than the ASP has over the last 12 months compared to say 36 months ago.  So for us it\u2019s a continuation of that theme in 2017. I don\u2019t think you should think about it in terms of spec versus non-spec. We\u2019re not changing our stripes there. We put a little more in to the production pipeline, but it\u2019s only about 30% which isn\u2019t terribly different than it was a year ago. And then mix, the mix question it\u2019s not geographic, right. Our margin profile doesn\u2019t change that much across different parts of the country. Certainly there\u2019s a little bit of a mix differential entry level versus move up versus the active adult space, and so that influences our margin. But we don\u2019t see that having significant impact next year.  And the other thing that obviously feeds in to our margins is the interest expense. Obviously our interest costs are up in fiscal \u201917 versus \u201916 because of the capital raises that we did in net in 2016. But we think that essentially gets offset by volume differential so we think it\u2019s a neutral on our margin \u201916 to \u201917. So I don\u2019t know if that helps, but all those things factor in, but I would tell you land and input cost particularly labor are the primary drivers. Operator : We\u2019ll go next Mike Dahl with Barclays. Mike Dahl : Just wanted to go back to some of the comments around the land spend and the balance sheet. And it sounded like just tying a couple of things together would suggest that cash from op should see real nice improvement in 2017, just to get to those balance sheet targets. So just wanted to get any sense of quantification you can provide on cash flow? And then related to that as you think about, there seems to be a kind of pivot towards a longer journey of improving turns and if there is anything you can give us as far as also quantification for inventory turn targets that would be great. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: I\u2019ll start Mike, in terms of free cash flow generation we haven\u2019t provided any guidance. I think it is fair to say we expect the business to grow in \u201917 and against that backdrop not spending as much on land acq in particular but also land development combined that we expect to be cash flow generative this year.  I think if you could take a step back, we are not pivoting away from investing in the business, but what we are doing is spending money today to improve the assets that we\u2019ve acquired over the last couple of years which we think generates growth in closings, and so we\u2019re spending more on development. So historically if you\u2019d gone two years ago, we were probably 50-50 land acq versus development spend. Given the numbers that you saw today, that number is clearly moving more towards development, which bodes well for cash generation because what we are doing is improving the assets to generate sales and actually getting a return on our investment which you heard Ryan talk about.  We want to be balanced in that. So we don\u2019t have our foot quite as heavy on the gas for growth for future acquisition, but we want to maintain the growth associated with the investors we made over the last couple of years. Ryan Marshall : And Mike as you heard us probably say in the prepared remarks, our ability to do that is really because of the 30% annual compound growth rate that we had on land acquisition investment really starting in 2013. So the health of our land pipeline is quite robust and we\u2019re setup for very nice success and very nice growth as we move in to the future years.  I\u2019ll take the piece or your question that you had on inventory turns. Inventory turns is a huge part of driving the type of returns on investment that we\u2019re looking for. Land is clearly the biggest investment that we have on our balance sheet and so as we\u2019re going to move the needle on overall inventory turns, the focus is squarely on efficiency of land.  You heard me talk about a focus being in getting more efficient and lean with our land inventory. We provided a few more details on that today, but if you look at our current vintage of acquisitions that we\u2019re making, there\u2019s a heavy percentage of options which certainly help with the goal of driving inventory turns. The average year supply is near three, even slightly below three and the average size of those excluding a couple of large Del Webb acquisitions are around 100.  So we think we are doing some very nice things that are different and going to create enhanced inventory turns for us in the future. Mike Dahl : And that\u2019s what I kind of driving at because clearly this is one of the one of the main levers to drive real improvement in returns over the next couple of years just in terms of how you\u2019re turning the land and managing the owned option mix, and so to follow-up on that because I think option deals have been difficult to come by in a lot of places and for a lot of builders. So could you give us any examples of successes that you can keep it broad regionally and where are you having the most success walking up new deals on the option side and where are you still seeing some challenges? Ryan Marshall : Mike I\u2019ll let Bob take that one, maybe I\u2019ll just chime in with one little overwriting comment, and then I\u2019ll let Bob give you a little bit more color. But 46% of our acquisitions recently had some component of an option mixed in to the transaction. Certainly options are attractive, we strive to get them. We\u2019re not going to overpay however, solely for the goal of having more options.  The goal again is to manage risk, to drive a better and higher return on invested capital. When it makes sense to do options we\u2019re certainly going to strive to do it. I\u2019ll let Bob give you a little more color on some of the geographic. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Mike we\u2019ve talked about it before. It\u2019s actually - I don\u2019t know that there is a geographic ability to do with the hire in one place versus another necessarily. They are all individually negotiated, sometimes we chose to put our money partner in between, but that\u2019s a little bit more challenging because return is scarce on a relative basis and they want some and we want some.  What I would offer is, markets where we have good, long, deep relationships with the land community and have high relative market share offer us more opportunities. We get to see more deals, we see them earlier and so our opportunities there seem to lend themselves to more activity again where we\u2019ve got again a long tenured land team and with good relative market share. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : I wanted to ask you two questions if I could related to leverage, I guess. First I was wondering if you could tell us how you prioritize M&A in the current environment relative to repurchases, let\u2019s say, given that your leverage is already now expected to rise above your targeted range this year? Ryan Marshall : Stephen this is Ryan. Our prioritization of capital remains in the following order : investment in to our ongoing operations specifically land is priority number one. We include M&A in that same category. So we look at it very much like a land transaction to the extent that we can do an M&A deal, it certainly gives us in many cases a ready now or a quicker land pipeline versus buying something raw that\u2019s got to go through the entitlement process.  The second piece of our capital strategy was to continue to fund our dividend which we are doing. And then the third piece of that strategy was a share buyback. Given where we were at with the state of our business, we made a decision to announce a $1.5 billion share buyback that\u2019s taken place over the last 18 months. We\u2019ve executed on the 500 million piece of that in 2016 in the back half. We\u2019re going to continue to execute against that plan for the $1 billion in 2017.  But, look, we\u2019re out in the market, we\u2019re looking for opportunities. Certainly evaluation comes in to play when we are looking at M&A, no different than we wouldn\u2019t overpay for a piece of raw land we don\u2019t want to over pay for a potential acquisition either.  I\u2019ll let Bob take the debt-to-cap piece. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: I think the only think I would add to it Ryan just as Stephen is, we\u2019ve also always said that while the guard rails are 30% to 40%, we would go above or beneath them if we saw a compelling reason to do so. But that you should expect us to tell you when we do that and how we expect to get back in to those guard rails.  So, example, if there were transactions that we found compelling that would make up a factor here, push us to a 45% debt-to-cap ratio, we would do that if we thought it was beneficial to shareholders.  Having said that, we would probably expect say as part of that dialog saying here is how and when we would expect to be able to drive that ratio back in to our 30% to 40% range. So certainly they are not mutually exclusive, we can do both. It really would boil down to Ryan\u2019s point, if we saw a compelling to buy it because we look at it as a land transaction. Stephen Kim : My next question is a little bit more broad about leverage. I think that having gone through the cycles that we all have, I think most people would say and probably the most important thing that we need to keep in mind as a builder is to make sure that our leverage that we\u2019re keeping an eye on our leverage ratio at all time.  What strikes me so interesting right now is that your two largest competitors seem to be prioritizing a more defensive approach I might say to leverage and their current net debt-to-cap ratio is they are kind of moving below their historical norms. One is way below and the other one is near the bottom end of the range that you would kind of talked about and seems like it\u2019s moving somewhat lower. You all have talked about moving to a balanced approach towards products mix, but your leverage is moving well above peers were not too long ago you were among the lowest in the industry. So from a leverage perspective it seems you\u2019re essentially almost trading strategies with your peers, and I was wondering, could you sort of articulate for us what you think the essence of the disagreement is or what you see differently and why is this the right time in the cycle to lever up rather than to de-lever? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah I don\u2019t consider it candidly levering up. I mean we are at a higher rate than we were for all the reasons that Ryan just talked about. We invested in the business including M&A and two deals that were fairly significant capital users, and we are buying back our shares which again was part of the strategy. And all with it, if you remember back, this was December of \u201914 when we did the investor day, we said those are our priorities. And again the guide rails are 30% to 40%.  I can\u2019t comment on what our peers are doing. I think what you\u2019re hearing from most and you are hearing from us as we see continued growth in this space to the ability to earn return on the investments we\u2019re making.  So it\u2019s interesting, I don\u2019t think we are trading out our strategy, we\u2019re executing on it, and we\u2019re at the higher end of our range, but we think that we can de-lever that overtime as we run the business. So, interestingly if you talk about land approach while we are investing in the business to everything you heard us talk about, we are focused on shorter, faster, turning, high asset efficiency transactions which we think mitigates risk, and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at, risk management. We think our strategy fits in that and so not being defensive, I don\u2019t think we really have \u201clevered\u201d up. Yes, it\u2019s a little bit higher, but certainly within the framework that we want to operate. Ryan Marshall : Yeah, and Stephen I\u2019d also add to that. When you look at the maturities of our long term debt it\u2019s very attractive. So certainly we\u2019re paying attention to a number of things, we\u2019re paying attention to what our absolute debt-to-cap rate is, we\u2019re paying attention to what we think the growth of the business looks like, and the cash flow that\u2019s going to be generated and then what those long term maturities are. And I think when we put all of that in to the soup and we come out with what our strategy is, we like them a lot and we\u2019re running it. Certainly your job is to compare us to our peers and pay attention to the differences, but I think we \u2018re running our strategy as opposed to as Bob as opposed to taking someone else\u2019s. Operator : The next question is from Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Stephen East : Ryan I\u2019ll come back to with the ROIC question in a minute, but I\u2019ll give you all a change of pace for a second. You are the third builder in three days that the fourth quarter orders are stronger than historical season patters. So as we look at that, do you all think you\u2019re seeing pull forward going on in the industry or has demand just ramped from the third quarter for you all and if you think for the industry.  And then when you look at your segments, could you talk a little bit about it. I was surprised that active adult was not stronger than it was from an order perspective. So if you could just talk about the three product segments and what you think you all have seen. Ryan Marshall : Steven this is Ryan, so thanks for the question, a couple of things here. Let me take the segment question first, when we look at the active adult segment it\u2019s historically a segment that performs better in the spring selling season. If you think where the locations of those communities are, they are in the southern states. It\u2019s generally the folks that are migrating from north to south. So I don\u2019t know that anything abnormal is going on within that segment, other than it is a segment that I think is highly sensitive to consumer sentiment and consumer confidence levels. We actually saw that get stronger as we move through the quarter. So I\u2019d expect to probably see some added strength from that buyer group as we move in to the first quarter. As far as, demand and has it been pulled forward? I don\u2019t believe that. I believe that as we move through the quarter, we saw some choppiness. There was certainly some choppiness and consumer sentiment and consumer confidence lag if you will and maybe even a little bit of a vacuum that was created around the time of the election.  I think once we got pass the election, things started to at least calm and folks had a little bit clear picture of what their future might have looked like. We\u2019ve seen as we talked to our operators and we listen to what\u2019s going on our sales offices. We\u2019re seeing good consumer sentiment and I think that\u2019s a positive thing for not only us, but the entire industry.  We saw a little bit of an uptick in interest rates, we talked about that. We don\u2019t see that dampening overall demand or desire to purchase, and we\u2019re optimistic about what prospects are for Q1. Stephen East : And then if you look at the returns and just a couple of questions around this. Are you more focused on ROE or ROIC? And then as you look at the variety of drivers, I know you\u2019ve touched in a variety of ways. But when you look at all the potential drivers, could link order sort of your focus if you will from incremental volumes, pricing, controlling your SG&A to I know it\u2019s all of those things. But I\u2019m trying to understand how you all think about pulling the levers the most aggressively to hit your ROIC or ROE targets? Ryan Marshall : Stephen, we underwrite ROIC, so that\u2019s the metric that we pay attention to. I think ROE is certainly interesting and something that we look at, but is not the metric that we underwrite to, its\u2019 ROIC. In terms of the levers, I think it\u2019s difficult to say there\u2019s a one size fits all strategy. Every single transaction is a little bit different depending on the price point, the buyer group, the nature of the land transaction.  We do and we are making different decisions on a case by case basis to maximize margin. Sometimes it\u2019s more price less volumes, sometimes it\u2019s more volume less price, because that\u2019s ultimately what\u2019s going to turn the asset and drive the returns that we\u2019re looking for.  I would tell you that we have made a pivot in the way that we are looking at this. Historically we were probably heavily focused on margin as being the primary driver, and we\u2019re leading the organization to have more of a balance and make the appropriate decisions on pace and price to get the intended outcome. Operator : The next question is from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner : Ryan I appreciate your comments on the demands, recent trends there and it\u2019s good to hear that deposits outlook and doesn\u2019t appear to any impact from higher so far. I guess just adding on to that line of questioning, your backlog conversion was very strong, this quarter it came in above your guidance.  I know you are not a big spec builder, but I was curious if through the quarter as rates started to move and may be in to January, have you seen any evidence of buyers looking to buy more spec homes or homes that are closer to that delivery date to mitigate a potential continued increase in rates, or has the demand pattern between to be built and spec remain pretty constant over that time period? Ryan Marshall : We haven\u2019t seen a huge shift in demand Alan, and frankly we haven\u2019t altered our spec strategy. So if we go back a year ago, we introduced more spec in to our overall production pipeline than what we had been say two years ago or three years ago. We\u2019re still running at a fairly low rate, and as Bob mentioned we\u2019ve got just over 600 thinner specs which is less than one per community which is the number that we target.  We are still introducing specs in to our system because it helps with production, it helps to even out a production flow with our trade partners and when we can provide them with consistency of work, that\u2019s a good thing. We want to keep our trade partners busy and on our job sites.  As far as consumers go, I think anytime there is a threat or a talk of rates increasing it does create a little bit of urgency if you will to make a buying decision buy a spec, lock an [array], get a loan closed.  As I mentioned the fact that we\u2019re still at a very historically low rate that all still works to the buyers favor at the end of the day. So we didn\u2019t see a noticeable shift between spec and to be built. Alan Ratner : And second question, you made the comments about labor and keeping your trades busy. I was down in Texas last week and one concern that some big builders down there have is that there is a big pretty migrant workforce base specifically shows up around this time of the year ahead of the selling season and some of these builders were just concerned given all the uncertainty on the immigration policy and the rhetoric that we might approach February and those workers may just not show up.  So I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve had recent conversations with your trades. Is that a concern you are hearing on the labor front or has your workforce remained pretty steady and as such are not overly concerned about that? Ryan Marshall : Our labor remains tight, but we\u2019re managing very affectively with the labor that\u2019s out there. We\u2019ve got very strong relationships with our trade partners and our division teams are purchasing procurement agents, our division presidents, our VPs of construction. Our folks on the ground I think have done an outstanding job in managing and maintaining those really strong relationships with vendors that frankly have a stable supply of labor.  As far as what\u2019s going to happen with immigration policy, I think we\u2019re watching like everybody in the entire country. There\u2019s not just our company, not just our industry, I think everybody is looking at what\u2019s going to happen with some of the policies out of the new administration. Immigration is just one of those topics that we\u2019re paying attention to. Operator : The next question is from Jack Micenko with SIG Jack Micenko : Wanted to understand what\u2019s different in your thinking on the margin outlook for \u201917 compared to the fourth quarter. You had a nice beat in the fourth quarter, and I think the Wieland drag should be lifted going in to next year. So wondering what\u2019s behind the commentary towards the lower end? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah Jack, I guess it\u2019s really a reiteration of what we talked about a little while ago. We\u2019ve got higher land, we\u2019ve higher labor and we knew most of that 90 days ago, but certainly the interest rate increase and the impact on affordability factors in to that. So just on balance, our expectation is that we\u2019ll be at that lower end. There are still very high margins and always worth it to reiterate, we don\u2019t underwrite the margins, we underwrite the return. And we think it will be return accretive as well. Ryan Marshall : And Jack I\u2019d just add, the guidance that we gave a quarter ago was 24 to 24.5. We\u2019re reiterated that guidance. We have steered towards the lower end of it just based on what we\u2019re seeing in our backlog and some of the other factors that we anticipate in 2017. Our expectations for cost increases both labor and house are in the 1.5% to 2% for 2017, which we see is very reasonable.  So to Bob\u2019s point, we have a lot of communities cycling out, a lot of communities cycling in, somewhere on the order of about 250 out and 250 new come in. So as we work through that, we look at the different margin profiles that\u2019s how we\u2019ve come up with our estimates and we tried to provide good transparency and communication to you all to help with the way you build your models. Jack Micenko : And I think in your prepared you\u2019d said, discounts 90 bps higher year-to-year, 40 bps quarter-to-quarter did I hear it right? And then second, the quarter-to-quarter numbers are almost half the year. Is there a common thread there or is that may be trying to offset some of the movement in interest rate. It looks like mortgage rates are up above that much in the fourth quarter. Just curious what was driving the change there? Ryan Marshall : Yeah Jack I think it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag. I certainly think some of it may have been interest rate related. We also had probably slightly, we had a few more specs going in to the fourth quarter than we generally run at and we know just from buyer behavior the margin profile on a home that\u2019s done and sitting on the ground. This is not as robust as one where a customer can pick out everything that they want to pick out, the way they want to do it. So that\u2019s probably a combination of both of those things. And Bob I don\u2019t know if you got anything else you\u2019d add to that? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah, the only thing I\u2019d add Jack is 3.1% in the current quarter, it\u2019s a little over $12,000 a unit, so it is still moderate on relative terms. So to all the points that Ryan made it\u2019s not like we\u2019re seeing it go up to 7% or something like that. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Zeumer, at this time I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Jim Zeumer : Thank you everybody for the time this morning on today\u2019s call. If you\u2019ve got any questions we\u2019ll certainly be available over the remainder of the day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead, sir. James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Rochelle, and good morning. I want to welcome you to PulteGroup's Conference Call to discuss our first quarter financial results for the period ended March 31, 2017. Joining me for today's call are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slide that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We will also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later today. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. That said, let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. As we closed out 2016, there was concern in and around the housing industry about the potential impact the rising interest rates would have on buyer demand heading into the 2017 spring selling season. With the first quarter complete, it is clear that higher rates have not dampened buyer interest. In fact, it looks like the housing recovery may be picking up steam. There are several dynamics that continue to sustain and drive the housing recovery. On the demand side, gains in jobs combined with low interest rates are all working to drive consumer confidence higher. Coupled with the limited supply of new homes, we're experiencing a supply and demand environment that is favorable for housing. In particular, I would point to jobs, wages, and consumer confidence as being among the most important drivers of housing demand as they link a potential buyer's ability to buy a home with the confidence to do so. Overall, we believe these dynamics will continue to support an improving new home sales environment. And like most in the industry, we're encouraged by Q1 demand conditions and have high expectations for the remainder of 2017. With this as a background on the current business environment, we're excited to discuss the company's first quarter operating and financial results. As was the trend for much of 2016, our Q1 results reflect a positive impact of our increased investments as we generated 14% growth on the top line and 17% growth in earnings per share. I'm pleased to say that consistent with our value creation focus, we've been able to grow our operations while continuing to deliver high returns on invested capital. Bob will review the quarter in detail, but there are a few points that I want to touch on. First, our results continue to benefit from the increased investment in the business over the past several years that is allowing us to expand our community count and drive higher volumes and revenues. Second, we reaffirm our expectations for full year gross margins. Although Q1 came in slightly lower than guidance, the difference was driven more by the geographic and buyer mix of homes ultimately closed in Q1 rather than a meaningful shift in pricing or cost dynamics. Third, we updated our full year SG&A guidance and now project that it will improve by as much as 50 basis points versus previous guidance as we expect to realize improved overhead efficiencies. We announced that we took actions in Q3 of last year to materially reduce our SG&A expenses, and we're realizing the benefits of those actions. And finally, our land investment for the quarter is consistent with the plans we outlined previously for 2017. This includes investing in shorter, faster turning projects as we target a long-term mix of owning three years of lots and optioning three years. Consistent with this focus, the average duration of projects approved in the quarter was approximately 2.5 years. Let me touch on one final point before handing the call over to Bob. I have talked about the concept that over time there are opportunities for us to increase the penetration of the buyer groups we serve. While the resulting discussions tended to focus on the potential to increase our market share among first time millennial buyers, I would highlight that the boomer population is just as big as the millennials and they typically have much stronger financials and higher homeownership rates. This is obviously a buyer group that we know well and have served without rival under our Del Webb brand. Through our legacy web communities, our new Del Webb offerings and our age-targeted Pulte, DiVosta and even Centex offerings, we see the potential to grow our active adult business going forward. In fact, our newest Del Webb in Nashville has experienced excellent demand despite not having formally grand-opened, and helped to support the strong active adult performance we realized in the quarter. With 75 million people in each of the huge book end generations of the millennials and boomers, we see opportunities to expand our scale among both of these demographics. Now, let me turn the call to Bob. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. Our first quarter results have the company off to a strong start and position us to achieve the performance objectives we have set for the year. Sign-ups in the first quarter increased 8% to 6,126 home and were up 16% in dollars to $2.4 billion. Looking at our Q1 sign-ups by buyer group, first time was essentially flat compared with last year at 1,762 homes; move up gained 12% to 2,831 homes; and active adult increased 13% to 1,533 homes. The nice increase in active adult was driven in part by our new Del Webb in Nashville which, as Ryan noted, is receiving great buyer interest. Our absorption pace for the quarter which was down 1% compared with last year was influenced by the timing of community openings and closeouts over the past 12 months. We had a number of high volume first time buyer communities operating in 2016 that ultimately sold out during the year and their replacements are just getting opened. In the case of active adult paces, our newest Del Webb had a positive impact in the quarter. Breaking absorption down by buyer group, first time and move up were both down 5% while active adult was up a robust 17%. Consistent with recent trends, we continue to realize meaningful top line growth as Q1 home sale revenues increased by 14% to $1.6 billion. The higher revenues for the period were driven by a 6% or a $22,000 increase in average selling price to $375,000 combined with a 7% increase in closings to 4,225 homes. Our Q1 closings by buyer group were 29% first time, 44% move up, and 27% active adult. This compares to 29% first time, 41% move up, and 30% active adult in the first quarter of last year. Based on the homes we currently have under construction, we expect a sequential increase in deliveries of roughly 15% to 20% resulting in second quarter closings in the range of 4,850 to 5,050 homes. Our average sales price for the quarter increased 6% over last year to $375,000 driven by the ongoing shift in our business towards move up communities along with price increases realized within each buyer group. Looking at our ASPs by buyer group, first time was up 10% to $277,000, move up was up 4% to $444,000, and active adult was up 4% to $367,000. You may note that our first time ASP of $277,000 was down sequentially from the $301,000 we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. That decrease primarily reflects a mix shift due to fewer California closings which carry much higher prices. Consistent with our guidance that we expect our average sales price to exceed $400,000 in 2017, our ASP and backlog is $408,000. This is up 6% compared to last year and is up from $396,000 in the fourth quarter, and is likely the first time our backlog ASP has exceeded $400,000. Looking at margins, our reported first quarter gross margin was 23.2% which is down from last year. Our gross margins reflect the ongoing impact of anticipated land, labor, and materials cost increases. Margins in the quarter were also impacted by the mix of homes closed as we deliver fewer active adult homes which typically carry our highest gross margins. In the quarter, we continue to have success in realizing higher lot premiums and option revenues. In fact, total option revenues and lot premiums increased 10% compared to last year to approximately $73,000 per closing. Sales discounts for the quarter totaled 3.3% or approximately $13,000 per home which represents a 70-basis point increase over Q1 of last year. Based on our current backlog as well as the mix of communities and related closings anticipated through the balance of the year, our full year gross margin guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect full year margins at the lower end of our guidance range of 24% to 24.5%. Consistent with our expectation for improving margins over the balance of the year, we expect a sequential gain of 30 to 60 basis points in our Q2 gross margin compared with our first quarter results. Looking at our overheads, SG&A in the quarter was $236 million or 14.9% of home sale revenues. Compared with last year, this represents a decrease to our overhead in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue. As noted in our press release this morning, SG&A for the quarter included an expense of approximately $15 million or almost a full percentage point of revenue resulting from the resolution of certain insurance matters. In the comparable prior year period, SG&A was $242 million or 17.4% of home sale revenues. With our reported SG&A, including the $15 million insurance charge being down $6 million and 250 basis points as a percentage of revenues, it's clear that the actions we took last year were successful in lowering cost and driving greater overhead leverage as we work to enhance our operating margin. Given the success of actions taken to lower overheads, we now expect our full year SG&A in 2017 to be in the range of 12% to 12.5% of revenues compared with our previous guidance of 12.5% of revenues. As we are maintaining gross margin guidance, it points to our full year operating margin to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%. Turning to our financial services businesses, we generated pre-tax income of $14 million in the quarter compared with $10 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase in pre-tax was primarily the result of higher closing volumes in our homebuilding operations. Mortgage capture rate for the first quarter was 80% compared with 81% last year. In aggregate, we delivered pre-tax income of $139 million in the first quarter inclusive of the $15 million insurance charge which represents an increase of 18% over Q1 of 2016. Income tax expense for the quarter was $48 million which represents an effective tax rate of 34.3%. Our tax rate was lower than previous guidance due to the new equity compensation accounting standard that requires us to record certain tax attributes related to stock compensation through the tax provision which in the past had been recorded directly to shareholders' equity. As the stock compensation-related tax attributes are tied to stock sales or option exercises by employees, it's difficult to estimate the impact of this standard on our future tax rate. As such, we still estimate our effective tax rate, excluding any impact from the standard, will be approximately 36.5% for the remainder of the year but our reported tax rate may vary due to the standard. On the bottom line, net income for the first quarter was $92 million or $0.28 per share. Prior year net income was $83 million or $0.24 per share. Our Q1 2017 diluted earnings per share was calculated using approximately 320 million shares which is a decrease of 30 million shares or 9% from 2016 due primarily to share repurchase activities. Switching over to our balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $424 million of cash after having used $100 million to repurchase 4.7 million common shares in the quarter at an average price of $21.30 per share. As we've discussed on our Q4 call, we expect to repurchase $1 billion of our shares in 2017 and that the timing of these repurchases will be driven in part by the normal seasonal cash flows of the business. Based on our quarter end cash balance and the expected near-term cash needs of the business, we anticipate the rate of our repurchase activity will increase in the second quarter. As always, our decision to repurchase shares is subject to overall business and financial market conditions. Given share repurchases completed in the quarter, we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40% and we anticipate it will move slightly higher over the course of the year due to our repurchase activities. We do, however, expect that future earnings will move us back inside our targeted debt-to-cap range of 30% to 40%. I'll close out my prepared remarks with a few data points on the strong performance of our homebuilding operations. We ended Q1 with 8,200 homes under construction which is an increase of approximately 4% over last year. The majority of the increase in our production relates to our sold backlog as, in total, specs represent only 25% of our homes in production which is down about 200 basis points from last year. And we continue to tightly control our finished spec inventory as we ended the quarter with only 600 finished spec homes or less than one per community. Community count for the quarter increased 10% to 780. This was higher than we expected and was due in large part to a slower closeout of communities as opposed to an acceleration of our expected community openings. As a result, we still anticipate year-over-year community count growth of 5% to 10% for 2017. Our land investment for the quarter totaled $566 million which is consistent with last year excluding the purchase of the John Wieland assets. Consistent with prior comments that land development will be a bigger percentage of this year's spend, Q1 land development was 57% of the total, up from 54% last year. On the acquisition side, we continue to focus on smaller, faster turning projects resulting on our average deal size for the quarter being under 90 lots for the duration of roughly 2.5 years from the time we opened for sales. The transactions approved in the quarter were split roughly 60/40 between move up and first time communities with a limited number of active adult lots. We ended the quarter with 95,000 owned lots with another 42,000 lots controlled via option. Our owned lot supply continues to drop further below the five-year mark as we target a long-term goal of owning three years of land and controlling another three years through options. In summary, and echoing some of Ryan's thoughts, we're pleased with the operating and financial performance we realized in the quarter. As important, I think our Q1 results put us in an excellent position to deliver another year of strong earnings growth and higher returns on invested capital. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan for some final comments on market conditions. Ryan? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. As I've talked about at the outset of this call, we have a positive view on the overall housing demand and believe that economic improvement, jobs, consumer confidence, and limited housing supply will continue to provide long-term support for new home sales. These factors along with favorable demographics will continue to work in our favor. While the potential for higher rates and any resulting impact on affordability must be watched, we are optimistic about buyer demand and overall supply dynamics going forward. More specific to our first quarter, let me provide a few high-level comments. Starting out West, overall demand conditions were very strong and I would highlight Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico and Northern California as the areas of particularly strong buyer interest. Weather in California was an issue not so much in terms of hindering demand but it certainly created challenges with construction and land development. Similar to what we've experienced in Texas in prior years, we will be playing catch-up for a couple of quarters. We generally saw very good demand in the middle third of the country as buyers remained active within our Midwest and Texas operations. And finishing here in the East, demand conditions held up well in the quarter although we did see pockets of softness at higher price points in some of our markets. Through the first few weeks of Q2, we continue to experience strong buyer demand and good traffic into our communities. Combined with historically low interest rates, we have every reason to expect demand will remain strong through the remainder of the spring selling season. Before opening the call to questions, I want to thank our employees who do an outstanding job every day of delivering a superior quality home and a great buying experience for our customers. You're the reason we've gotten off to a great start in 2017. Now, let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Ryan. We will open the call for questions. So that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time in this call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Rochelle, if you explain the process we'll get started with the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Ryan, just wanted to ask you. The SG&A improvement was pretty dramatic during the quarter which speaks to a disciplined approach to operations. How much is left? And with the SG&A dollars you took out coming from existing markets that you're de-emphasizing, how much is left and how do we think about where the trajectory of SG&A goes from here? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, Bob. Thanks for the question. We're very pleased with the movement that we've made with a disciplined focus in dramatically reducing our SG&A expense. As far as the forward rate goes, what I would tell you is excluding commissions which we've now included in our SG&A line as I think everyone's well aware now, our SG&A will continue to slightly grow as we move throughout the year which is mostly driven by expenses associated with new community openings. As we talked about on our Q4 call, we expect to open about 250 new communities in 2017 so that'll have a little bit of an impact as we move throughout the year. But our expectation is that we'll continue to see favorable improvement on our overall SG&A spend. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good. You're making a ton of progress. I was just hoping for my second question. Maybe you could give us a little bit more regional color in terms of where you're seeing strength and weakness in markets? And kind of if you got, like, $50 or $60 stability in Texas for oil, how that market will look going forward? All your comments are very encouraging. It seems like you're aggressively managing demand to optimize return on capital by balancing pace and price. Do you see the same pace of demand persisting during the balance of the year and which markets will reflect that the most? Thanks and good luck. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Bob, that's a great question. I'll probably just reiterate some of the things that I shared in the prepared remarks which is really reflective of what we're seeing. We like the demand environment that we're seeing in California. The weather was certainly tough with a lot of rain that came in the first quarter. Didn't seem to impact demand but certainly will have an impact on our development timelines. We like what we're seeing in Arizona for certain. Texas remains a strong market for us. We also like what we've gotten out of the Midwest which has been a very strong performer. I also like what we're seeing in Florida. When we look to the Northeast and the Southeast, good markets for us where we have some nice positions. We did see some pockets of softness especially in some of the higher price points. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And just one last thing. Thoughts on the lumber tariff relative to impact on profitability going forward? Obviously, kind of very recent development with today's news. Thank you. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Bob. I guess on the lumber tariffs, you've seen lumber prices move over the last 10 or 12 weeks. I think most people would suggest that's really been in anticipation of this. And I don't think that the announcement last night was any more significant; it might even be a little less significant than people were expecting. So volatility drives change and I'm not sure what will happen. But at this point it looks like the market has been expecting this so we don't expect anything dramatic from that. Obviously, how it plays out over time can have an influence on our cost structure Operator : And next we'll hear from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to dive into the absorption pace data that you gave out before, and it was very helpful obviously. And you kind of alluded to timing of community closeouts influencing the sales pace decline year-over-year. Just trying to get a sense of, perhaps, how much that really did impact. I mean, was it a degree of magnitude, a couple of percent or was it essentially all of the decline? And even if, let's say, if the sales pace was flat and I'm thinking now more in terms of the first time segment, that's still kind of contrast, perhaps, to other builders that are seeing more demonstrable year-over-year increases in absorption rate. And I was just kind of curious in how do you think about that. Is it a mix issue for you guys or a positioning issue? Perhaps some of the stronger demand is in further out regions that maybe you're still not exposed to? So just any thoughts around that would be helpful. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Mike, it's Bob. Communities matter and as an example I'd use the fact that we posted really strong absorptions in the active adult side of the business which was impacted by the opening of the store in Tennessee that we talked about. Looking across the spectrum, if you look at the 5% down in the first time space, last year we had a number of communities that were generating really significant paces, that their replacements are either opening now or already have but we haven't seen the same paces out of them. You can cut this data 1 million different ways. If you look at the lower price points, those were typically that higher price point of the first time. We actually saw absorptions increase within that. So the mix of the communities we have opened at points in time contributes to the relative absorption pace. In terms of the move up space, you heard Ryan talk about that at the higher price points and this might be because consumers have more choice. There's more product on the ground or they're just taking a little bit longer to make decisions. So we think that contributed to the decrease in the move up space. We still feel good about the business. The margins are still good there; we just haven't seen the absorptions increase from where they were. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Mike, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. The other thing that I'd maybe share with you is we were very pleased with our Q1 sign-ups and, frankly, they were very much in line with our internal plan. I know you don't have visibility to that, but we were pleased with the results. When we look at comparing our results to our competitors, there's so many variables out there that do make it difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison. The other thing that kind of plays into that is the different approaches that everybody's taking with their different strategies as that relates to the buyer groups that we serve. As an example, I'd tell you you get a very different outcome if new community openings are skewed more toward first time buyers versus move up buyers. So that also kind of played into the results that we posted in Q1. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you, Ryan. That's helpful additional color as well. I guess just moving on the second question on the gross margins. You reiterated, I believe, your full year guidance and still expecting it to come in at the lower end of the range but maintaining that range. I was just curious in terms of, perhaps, so far this year you're almost four months done and a couple of months \u2013 two, three months \u2013 into the critical selling season. How would you view kind of upside or downside pressures to that gross margin guidance at this point in the year? I mean, Bob mentioned the lumber and you kind of feel like that's maybe baked into the market. But given how pricing is starting to shape up and a lot of balance of the year kind of maybe takes its queue from the selling season, how do you kind of ascertain upside and downside pressures to that gross margin guidance as you see it today? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Well, Mike, what we offer in terms of guidance is based on our backlog, so obviously we have a pretty significant backlog for the balance of the year. We're looking at margins on recent sales and we also think about the communities that we have coming online. So we're of the view that we can continue to deliver higher margins and we do expect improvement over the balance of the year. In terms of the variability against that, I think a lot of it will depend on consumer confidence. We think that's a primary driver of sort of the demand equation. Obviously, local decision-making, what communities are next to you, what are your competitors doing, can influence local decisions. But, broadly, we think that consumer confidence and obviously interest rates, we've got the specter of rising rates but it hasn't happened yet. So how people feel will probably be the driver of what happens on a relative basis, the margins between now and the end of the year. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Mike, and the only thing I'd add to that and Bob's kind of alluded to it, but I think when you look at the overall supply and demand dynamics that we're dealing with right now, it's favorable. There's not a lot of supply out there and demand is reasonably high given an improving economy and some good job growth and high consumer confidence. And so there's a lot of variability as Bob talked about, that we've got to pay attention to lumber and labor and other commodities. But on the whole, combined with what's out there in a broader economy along with the mix of communities, and this is \u2013 I hate to say mix again \u2013 but when you look at the communities that we know we have coming online and what the profile is, we like the guidance that we've provided for the balance of the year. Operator : And next we'll move to Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Just want to come back to the order number and make sure I'm understanding the comments you're laying out. I mean, a lot of folks are going to look at the 8% deceleration from the 15% to 17% you had in the second half of last year, also somewhat especially relative to peers at odds with their comments about the strong spring selling season. Now, is the main driver of that the shifting of the closing out of these high-volume communities? And if so, I heard a couple of different things about the replacements for those, that they will be coming on in 2Q which would imply that you could see some reacceleration in the absorption of order growth rate. But then I also heard that they may not have the same absorption pace. So how should we think about that? Is this just a temporary dip in the order rate do you expect with the strong demand reacceleration later on this year? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Nishu, there's a lot in there in the question but I think the best guidance that we can provide for you is that our absorption rate growth will be driven by our community count growth. We provided guidance that we'll be in the 5% to 10% range. We're executing against that. We ended the quarter at the higher end of that range given the slower closeout. So that's the direction that I would point you. Couple that with the things that Bob shared with you about some very high volume communities that we had in the first quarter of 2016 and as those replacements are just getting opened, I think that also contributed to the quarter-over-quarter comparison discrepancy that you're referring to. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Got it. And also thinking about the margins, the strong demand that we've seen so far, this certainly surprised a lot of people as you mentioned despite the increase in interest rates. Is it translating to pricing power? From some of your peers we've heard comments more along the lines of we need to max out absorptions and that's how the demand will be captured. Given that your absorptions are coming in more flattish, I know you mentioned some of the factors, but just broadly is this environment conducive for pricing power especially since rates have dipped back down again though? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: I think that is going to be market-specific. Certainly, where you've got strong demand you have the opportunity to work on price. I think we're trying to offset cost increases. But you've got a different, I think, dynamic at different price points, and so were you at the lower price points where you're seeing more volume you might have more opportunity for price rather than at the higher price points. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: And, Nishu, to your question about pace versus price, I would tell you that's something that we pay a lot of attention to as our stated goal is we're driving the highest and best returns that we possibly can on a community-by-community basis. Sometimes that's the volume lever, sometimes just a price lever and we work to optimize that in every single community. Operator : And next we'll move to Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow-up, I guess, first with the comment about lumber prices. If you could just give us a sense for kind of a rule of thumb what we should be thinking about in terms of the leverage to your margins if we see, let's say, a 10% increase in lumber cost year-over-year. On balance, I usually think of lumber being somewhere in the vicinity of high single digits to very low double digits of revenues. But I was curious as to what you would give us as a guidance rubric for titrating the effect of lumber prices to your margins. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: I think where you are, Stephen, in terms of as a percentage of lumber cost as a percentage of revenue, high single digits for the lumber package in total is probably not that far off but I think you also then have to split it though between your sticks versus your OSB because I'm pretty sure when you get into the high single digits you're probably including OSB as part of that package. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Yeah, fair. Okay. Great. And then obviously a lot of things we could talk about this quarter and you talk about the environment being strong, and certainly we see that and there's a degree to which a rising tide benefits everybody. At the same time though, your commentary about your slower sell out of communities, I couldn't help but noticing that that was similar language to what you had said in the fourth quarter. And so I guess the essence of my question is given the fact that there has been a fair amount of change at the company from a management perspective and a board level, it wouldn't surprise me if you all were in the process of sort of overhauling some of your processes, the way you analyze things and so forth. And I'm curious as to whether or not any of this in your estimation is manifesting itself at the grassroots level in your sales data and whether we should view this as sort of a transition period because I don't think you've articulated in that way unless I've missed it. But I was curious as to whether you think any of that is at work in what we're seeing here and it's sort of a temporary issue in nature. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: No, Stephen, I don't think that's the case at all. We're just turning over a lot of communities. We turn over, on average, 250 to 275 communities a year. So with the churn of those closing out and the new ones opening up, sometimes you've got a few straggler sign-ups that may linger a quarter longer than we would've originally anticipated. Operator : And next we'll move to Mike Dahl with Barclays. Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Ryan, just a follow-up on that last question and comment. In terms of the slower than expected closeouts, is there any geographic concentration or price point concentration that you can speak to on those delayed closeouts and is there a specific action plan in place for those communities? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Mike, we manage all of that at our local level and our local operations teams are incredibly skilled at managing the closeout of those communities and making those decisions. We're not managing to an exact community count number; that's just simply not the way that we run the business. I mentioned they may sign-up or two, may hang on an extra quarter. And not to get too far into the weeds, but the convention that we use to count whether or not a community is open is if it has activity in the quarter. So you could've had something, for example, a closeout in January and it's done but it would've been reported as an active community in the quarter. So it's not anything that we're concerned about frankly. Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I think that point is helpful because convention is different across builders. So thanks for that clarification. And then shifting to some of the comments around active adult and the community opening in Nashville. So I gather this is one of the newer vintages of the Del Webb community which looks quite a bit different than the legacy ones. Can you speak to of what you think has been the kind of the attributes that have accreted for a successful launch so far and whether or not you have similar community openings scheduled for the balance of the year on the Del Webb side and where those will be? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Mike, that's a great question. I would tell you that the attractive attributes of this particular Del Webb community are the same as the prior Del Webb communities that have very attractive lifestyle components that we know Del Webb buyers enjoy. And as much as we're selling a house, we're selling a lifestyle and that's really what that brand has been centered around for a long, long time. This particular community is one of our newer vintage communities of course that is a little smaller in nature, that doesn't have as much capital investment, they're a little faster turning. They also happen to be a little closer in to the city center, the restaurants, and some of the other infrastructure that those active adult buyers are looking for. So we're very optimistic and encouraged by the early demand that we've seen. It is still early. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we haven't formally grand-opened yet but early returns are positive. Operator : And next we'll move to Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Paul Przybylski - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : This is Paul Przybylski actually on for Stephen. First, I guess a question with your strategy for pricing. You mentioned earlier that we had the specter of rates moving higher this year. With respect to entry level, do you keep those prices flat or raise them with the risk of shrinking that buyer pool as we move through the year? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Paul, it is a community-by-community decision that we make with respect to pace and price and we under-write returns as I think we've shared with many of the folks often, and both elements are equally important. And so it's tough to paint it with a broad brush and tell you that one is more important than the other and that we're using one more often than the other. Paul Przybylski - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then how was the order cadence in the quarter and do you think you're continuing to see any pull forward and demand from the rate increase last year? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Paul, as I mentioned on maybe one of the earlier questions, as we looked at the order rate that came in through the first quarter of the year, we're very pleased with it. It was very much in line with our expectations and the way that we had kind of built our business plan for the year Paul Przybylski - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And next we move to Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and nice job on the SG&A leverage. Ryan, my first question, I wanted to dig into active adult as well. You sounded pretty bullish on the future of active adult and, obviously, with the size of the buyer pool equaling the millennials probably is a little bit under-focused on by investors. But at the same time, we have seen several builders either start a new active adult line or make an effort or commentary of expanding into active adult, and you guys are just kind of switching your focus there and away from the kind of the cruise liner Del Webb communities as you've called them to more smaller product, maybe with amenities but not as highly amenitized as the legacy communities. So as you look at the landscape today in active adult, and I have a follow-up just on the trends you're seeing from a demand perspective, but how do you view Del Webb today from a competitive landscape versus some of these other builders that have either recently entered active adult or are looking to expand their exposure there? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Alan. Thanks for the question. We are bullish on the Del Webb brand and have been for a long time. It's a big part of our company, it's a big part of what makes us unique and different, and that's a story that we've been telling for a long time. As far as these newer vintage communities, they're still quite large. They're still in the neighborhood of 500 to 1,000 lots, just substantially smaller than the 7,500-lot communities with multiple golf courses that we did under the kind of the cruise liner Del Webb days. But still quite large communities that will provide several years of strong absorptions and create a nice sense of community within those individual locations. When you look at the competitive landscape, we're not surprised at all that there are a lot of competitors that are seeing this as a big opportunity. There's 75 million buyers in that demographic. They're the wealthiest generation. They've arguably got the most liquid balance sheets, high homeowner ship rates, and they've got flexibility to kind of go and do the things that they want to do as they move into their retirement ages. The other piece that I think is important to think about is demographics here matter. And one of the things that we think we have working in our favor, as the millennials are beginning to reach age, as we see the peak of the millennial generation hitting the age 30 in the year 2020, they're starting to move on and buy their own homes as is demonstrated in some of the first time buyer numbers that are being reported. Well, the millennials are the children of the boomers and that's also freeing up the boomers to do some of the things that maybe they have put off doing as they've tried to get their millennial kids out of the nest. So we like the competitive position we have, we like the capability that we've spent several decades building inside of our organization, and we think we're positioned as well as anybody to compete in that segment. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: That's helpful, Ryan. Thank you. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: One other thing, Alan, that I'd maybe just add, that I failed to mention, is we're doing a significant amount or we're expanding our thinking to include something beyond just Del Webb as it relates to that boomer demographic. There is a significant piece of that boomer demographic that's not interested in age-restricted but they are interested in downsizing and living a different type of lifestyle as they retire. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it. I appreciate that, Ryan. And then just on the demand side from these buyers. You mention the flexibility and, of course, as the millennials move out from their basements that should free them up to move on to the next stages of their lives. But as we look at existing inventories where all these buyers have a home to sell, inventories continue to drop. They're among the lowest levels on record which would suggest, at least for the time being, they haven't moved forward with actually listing their homes on the market for sale. Now, understanding that most of these buyers are probably buying to-be-built homes from you, so maybe they wait to actually list their homes, can you give us any data maybe on traffic trends, or just anecdotal if you have that, just that would suggest that we should expect to start to see those wheels get set in motion going forward or is this, at this point, more of a kind of a view of what could happen or should happen based on the demographics? Thank you. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Alan. It's a good question. I think the best thing that I can probably provide for you is just a comment on what we saw overall within the quarter. We were very pleased with the traffic, very pleased with buyer interest and buyer demand and that really applied across all consumer groups that we serve. Operator : And next we'll move to Jack Micenko with SIG Investment. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey. Good morning. On slide six in the presentation, you talked about shortening the duration of your projects, I think, two and a half years. Obviously the Del Webbs, there's some longer tail communities in there and that sort of thing. Wondering if you could give us some context around where that's gone to and from, say I don't know, two or three years ago and how recent of a shift on that timeline is that? Is that something that's been in the works for some time or is that something more tied to, Ryan, your leadership? Just give us a sense of how that's kind of migrated over time? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Jack. This is a big tanker and it takes a little while for actions to take place. This really goes back to 2011 for all intents and purposes. So the value creation initiatives that got started then were focused on less land, not necessarily the three years owned, three years option that Ryan's outlined, that we're moving towards. But if you look over the last four or five years, the profile of the land that we've been buying has been much shorter in duration. We mentioned that we're two and a half years in the most recent quarter. It's not much different than that over the last couple of years before. So our owned lot position down below five years today was up in excess of eight years several years ago, and I think you'll continue to see that move down as we continue to cycle through these shorter positions and work off some of those longer positions that you talked about. That takes a little while but we're very pleased actually with the tenure of the land that we've been buying now over the last few years and expect to be able to do more of that over time. We're looking at options even in the Del Webb brand. We're trying to be capital-efficient. So I think we've talked about this, but there's a longer-dated community that we've gotten involved in in South Carolina. We think we'll be there for 10 years but we're buying the land on time, and so we think we could be really capital-efficient with that land as well. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then, Bob, since we have you, so the buyback cadence was lighter this quarter. Obviously, cash flows in your business change from quarter-to quarter. I know you acknowledge that \u2013 I guess the question here, the $1 billion this year is that still committed to and would that still get in the model? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Certainly. I mean, with the usual caveat of subject to market conditions, we are planning to buy back $1 billion of stock this year. Yes. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : All right. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll move to Joel Locker with FBN Securities. Joel T. Locker - FBN Securities, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Just digging down into SG&A a little bit. What was the commission for the first quarter I guess first of all? James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: 3.5%. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Roughly 3.5%. James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Sorry, I thought you were asking in dollars. I don't know that off the top of my head. Joel T. Locker - FBN Securities, Inc.: So if you take the $55 million and the $15 million charge, is it safe to say your base rate for SG&A is $166 million and growing? Is that a good way to look at it from our perspective? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: I think what Ryan talked about earlier, I think, is the right way to think about this. Our SG&A spend is truly variable on the sales commissions, but it is also variable based on new community openings. We've got start-up expenses. And so what we've tried to give you is a target run rate for the year. We had given you 12.5% coming into the year. We think we can do a little bit better than that, and so we've widened that out to 12% to 12.5%. Joel T. Locker - FBN Securities, Inc.: 12.5%. And was there anything else besides the $15 million that made it lighter? Like, if you don't actually do the math and you have $166 million outside of the charge and the commissions, was there anything else that you're maybe trying or that you see coming or increases you see in the second quarter based on new community openings that haven't been expensed yet? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, and that's what I alluded to in one of the earlier questions and Bob just kind of touched on it, Joel. We have 250 new communities that are opening throughout the year. We expense a significant amount of the new opening costs or the costs associated with those new openings in the quarter that those communities open. So in addition to the other variable components as new communities come online, that's the other variable number that will be added to our SG&A run rate on a go forward basis. Joel T. Locker - FBN Securities, Inc.: All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : And next we'll move on to John Lovallo with Bank of America. Peter Thomas Galbo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hey, guys. It's actually Pete Galbo on for John. Thanks for taking the questions. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Hey, Pete. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Hey, Pete. James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Good morning. Peter Thomas Galbo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Just a first one on SG&A. Bob, the total dollar amount being lower year-over-year and given some of the cost takeout that you mentioned from 3Q, can you just kind of dimension some of those cost takeouts for us that you kind of saw in the quarter and how to think about that on a run rate for the rest of the year? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: I think it was, really, it's people. And I don't mean to be insensitive, but we took a pretty big swing at people and I think we've talked about this in the past. It was largely focused on the corporate office. The reason being, and I think Ryan has used this analogy and I think it's perfect, as we were going through the initiatives of value creation over time, we were trying to fix the cars that was on the road or a building that we're ready to build so we put scaffolding up around it. We essentially, as most of those skill sets and processes and data analytics has been moved out to the field operations, thought that we had an opportunity to take down that scaffolding. So it's the people that we've taken out of the organization that really influenced that. Peter Thomas Galbo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Got it. No, that's helpful. And I know there's been a lot of questions around active adult here, and I think Ryan maybe touched on this briefly. But within that 17% absorption growth that you saw within active adult, is there a way to break out what percentage or factor that was the Del Webb portion versus the age-targeted but non-age-restricted piece that you guys have mentioned in the past? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: The majority of it was Del Webb. I don't have a specific percentage, but I'd point you to the majority of it being Del Webb. We are making new investments that are going to this non-Del Webb age-targeted but those are openings that will come in future periods. Peter Thomas Galbo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks, Pete. Operator : And next we'll move on to Buck Horne with Raymond James. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Going back to the comment about the repurchase program and potential market conditions. Could you elaborate on what may be some potential triggers or other thresholds that you would look at in terms of something that may reduce the targeted spend of $1 billion dollars this year? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Hey, Buck, it's Ryan. I think the biggest message that I'd want you to hear is that we're committed to the $1 billion buyback. Bob mentioned in his prepared script that we're taking into consideration the cash needs of the business. We ended the first quarter with $450-ish million in cash, so we really like our cash position. As we look at the balance of the year, we certainly anticipate ramping up that spend amount as we move into the second quarter. We probably don't have enough time on this call to list all of the potential things that could go wrong with the world economy that would influence that. I think the best bet is to go with the plan that we're buying $1 billion back. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And going to another just kind of a operating strategy thing. With demand strengthening and the spring selling season off to a good start, would it be a thought to strategically increase the production of unsold spec units even further to meet some of that demand? Is that something you would consider, and obviously that comes with balancing some of the risks of spec production? Just looking for some thoughts on that subject. And also if you've got the cancellation rate in the quarter, that'd be great. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: So, Buck, I'll speak to the spec start question first. About 18 months or so ago we did introduce an incremental additional amount of specs into our production pipeline. We like where we're running right now. As far as would we introduce more, we would introduce more in an effort to balance out our production pipeline to ensure that we can maintain a consistent and predictable cadence of production for our trades. We want to give nice stability and visibility to our trade partners so that we can keep them on our job site. We think that's one of the, probably, best and strongest tools that we have to maintain a predictable production pipeline. So our strategy is different than some of our other competitors that run at a higher spec rate. We believe that given our strategy and our focus on driving better returns on invested capital, the rate that we're running at is about right. And then to your question on the cancellation rate in the quarter, it was just over 12%. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks, Buck. Operator : And we'll move on to Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on the new Del Webb community here. It's a good looking community and I know it's been a long time coming for you guys. The first question I had with the community count and the closeouts maybe going slower than what you'd anticipated, should we think about gross margins in 2Q being at the lower end? I think you said 30 to 60-basis point improvement sequentially. Should we trim or think more about it being closer to 30 than 60? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: It's hard to answer that question with specificity. A lot of it's going to depend on when and where closings come in. We offer the range without a bias towards higher or lower within it. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. The second question I had, and I apologize if I missed this, did you all give any guidance for SG&A and where it should trend for 2Q? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Jay, we did not give it specific to Q2. What we have given is a full year range of 12% to 12.5% which is a 50-basis point improvement over the prior guidance that we had given of 12.5%. So I think as you're modeling it, you're building your models, look to our community count guidance that I'm sure you'll use to model your volume and that'll help give you a kind of a guidance of where overheads will run. As Bob mentioned and some of the other commentary that we provided, we're incredibly pleased with the movement that we've made on SG&A. We do anticipate it increasing slightly as we move through the year on the non-variable components. As we open up our new communities, there is spend that's associated with getting those new communities open. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks, Jay. Operator : And we'll move on to Ken Zener with Keybanc. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Hey, Ken. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Ken. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So I have a kind of a simple question. There was obviously a lot of enthusiasm communicated by builders, and today people might've thought your orders fell short. We look at it a little differently which is that your seasonal pace rose 40% which is actually your long-term average over 18 years, so I think you're doing well there. Is there anything \u2013 if I just flip it around, your community count growth, it was a lot, if it impacted the comments you made. Is there any reason to assume seasonality is not going to persist into the next quarter? Is there something dramatically different that we saw about March trends? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Ken, this is Ryan, and I'd answer it as a simple no. The seasonal trends that played out in the first quarter were very much in line with our expectations. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Excellent. And then my next question. Since you brought up spec, do you guys comment on or disclose your total units under construction which would be, obviously, your backlog, true spec, and then model homes so we could get a sense of the conversion of those total units in your closings? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. We've got 8,206 units under construction at March 31. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And that's backlog...? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: That's all inclusive. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: All-in. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And what was that last year and in 4Q please? Thank you. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: It's up 4% over last year. 4Q? Hang on a sec. James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: There was 7,486 at December 31. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: There you go. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And that will be all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to today's speakers for any additional or closing remarks. James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Rochelle. Thank you for your time on today's call. We will be available for calls throughout today. And we'll look forward to speaking with you in Q2. Thanks. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation.",

Reichardt - BTIG LLC Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Operator : Good day, and welcome to the PulteGroup's Quarter 2, 2017 Quarterly Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead, sir. James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Savannah, and good morning. I'm pleased to welcome all participants to PulteGroup's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slide that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later today. PulteGroup's second quarter earnings were impacted by several significant items, which are noted in our earnings release. As part of the call, we will be discussing our reported results, as well as certain aspects of our business as adjusted to exclude the impact of these significant items. A reconciliation of these adjusted results to our reported results is included in this morning's release and within the webcast slides accompanying this call. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our Q2 results. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm excited to speak with you today about PulteGroup's second quarter operating and financial results. Building on the strength and momentum of Q1, the company's results show a continuation of strong demand and even a slight acceleration in the business. Starting right at the top, our 12% growth in orders reflects both a strong demand environment and the increased investment we've made in the business. Given our emphasis on building to order, starting limited specs and our expanding share among higher price points, being able to accelerate from a year-over-year order increase of 8% in Q1 to 12% in Q2 surely reflects the strength of the underlying business. We also reported 12% growth in second quarter revenues, which supported an even more significant 27% increase in adjusting earnings of $0.47 per share. The leverage in earnings per share came in the form of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, coupled with a 10% reduction in share count, resulting from our ongoing repurchase program. However, it can't just be about driving growth for growth sake. We are seeking to grow intelligently, which I believe we're demonstrating as evidenced by the 140 basis point increase in ROE to 12.8% that we realized for the trailing 12 months. And with the backlog at $4.5 billion, our highest in a decade I might add, we are extremely well positioned to continue delivering strong operating and financial performance going forward. Our Q2 results clearly demonstrate the great progress we're making to grow our business, while delivering value to our shareholders. As pleased as I am with our growth and the strength of our quarterly results, I actually do want to address the earnings charge that we recorded in Q2 relating to our decision to address specific non-core or underperforming land assets. I note this charge because the decision to dispose of these assets is representative of positive changes taking place within PulteGroup. Our long-term focus remains on intelligently growing our business, while delivering high returns over the housing cycle. In the process, we are taking actions that we believe can allow us to seize on market opportunities, to drive more efficient operations and to reduce risk within the business. Electing to dispose of these underperforming land assets is a great example of the comprehensive approach we are taking. After a thorough assessment of our entire land pipeline, we identified these 5,000 lots for disposal. I would note that all, but 80 of these lots were put under control at least 10 years ago. And while no one likes having to take a charge, eliminating these positions allows us to recoup funds, to redeploy into high returning projects. At the same time, these decisions will directionally help to accelerate inventory turns and shorten our land pipeline, moving another step closer toward our goal of owning three years of land. Disposing of these lots is in alignment with our return focus, and it's an important step for us to take. In a similar vein, we are working with our local operations to ensure they are considering market share opportunities among all buyer segments. In recent years, our return-based underwriting process has focused our investments towards serving move-up buyers. This is a market position that's worked well for the business and, in turn, our shareholders. I believe, however, that building a business that is better balanced across the buyer groups can help to generate more growth, create a more diversified and lower risk business and yield greater local market share, each of which are points of emphasis for me. And while the current housing cycle is advancing to where all buyer groups are more actively involved, we are seeing opportunities to invest in high returning projects across all buyer categories. It'll be a multi-year process to realize a material shift in the mix of our business, but I want to make sure we're assessing all the opportunities to grow and diversify our operations as appropriate, of course, in each of the markets that we serve. And as our 2017 year-to-date results clearly demonstrate, we are succeeding in our efforts to realize greater leverage of our overhead spend. Our current results reflect the benefits of actions taken to run a more efficient operation. We're pleased with the progress made, but I believe there are additional opportunities for us to further leverage our overheads through scale and incremental efficiency. Finally, looking beyond our company-specific numbers, we continue to see positive buyer sentiment and generally improving demand trends across our markets. Driven in part by an expansion of the first-time buyer segment, housing demand is supported by a variety of positive factors, including an improving economy with low unemployment, high consumer confidence, low interest rates and supportive demographics. Given this backdrop, we remain constructive on the market and the potential for several more years of growth in overall housing demand. Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for a more thorough review of our second quarter results. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate the continued growth and overall strong financial performance of our business. As reported in this morning's release and mentioned by Jim, our reported Q2 results were impacted by several significant items that were recorded in the period. We spoke to these items in the release and provided a non-GAAP reconciliation table with the financials. But I think it'll be helpful for me to quickly walk through the items and highlight which income statement lines they impact. First, our decision to dispose of certain non-core land assets resulted in a charge of approximately $121 million, which breaks down as follows; $31.5 million of land impairment that is reflected in home sale cost of revenues, $81 million of net realizable value adjustments that are reflected in landfill cost of revenues, and $8 million of impairments of land held in a joint venture that is reflected in other expense, net. Second, we recorded a $12.1 million charge to home sale cost of revenues for warranty work associated with a construction claim at a closed community in Florida. As costs associated with this claim had previously been recorded in our construction defect reserves, we reversed $19.8 million of reserves that were directly attributable to this claim, including the development of incurred, but not reported claim activity. The benefit of this reversal is reflected as a reduction of SG&A. And finally, we recorded a net benefit of $23.8 million in our income tax expense line, resulting primarily from tax law changes and the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding this benefit, the company's effective tax rate would have been approximately 37%. I'll note the impact of these items as appropriate over the remainder of my comments. Let me now begin the review of our Q2 results. In the second quarter, our net new orders totaled 6,395 homes, which represents a 12% increase over the prior year. On an absolute basis, orders for the quarter showed gains across all buyer groups, as first-time orders were up 6% to 1,929 homes, move-up orders were up 21% to 2,931 homes, and active adult orders were up 6% to 1,535 homes. The growth in Q2 orders is consistent with our view that we continue to operate in a favorable demand environment. Adjusting for community count, our absorptions were down 2% compared with the last year, but at 2.7 sales per community per month remain at very healthy paces. Reported absorptions, particularly among our first-time buyers, is being influenced by the 2016 closeout of some high-volume communities, along with the ongoing mix shift in our business towards higher price points. Reflecting the strength of our business, we continue to generate significant growth as our second quarter home sale revenues gained 12% over last year to $2 billion. Higher revenues for the period reflect an increase of 6% or $23,000 in average sale price to $390,000, combined with a 6% increase in closing volume to 5,044 homes. Total deliveries for the quarter were consistent with our prior guidance. Looking at Q2 closings by buyer group, 29% were first-time, 47% were move-up, and 24% were active adults. This compares to 30% first-time, 43% move-up, and 27% active adult last year. At the end of the second quarter, the company had a total of 9,588 homes under construction, of which we expect to deliver between 5,400 and 5,600 homes in the third quarter. This would represent closing volume growth of between 8% and 12% over the prior year. As I indicated, our average sales price for the second quarter was up 6% from last year to $390,000. The higher closing ASP reflects the ongoing growth of our move-up business, along with higher prices being realized in each buyer group. For the quarter, average sales prices of first-time buyers increased 11% over the prior year to $291,000, move-up increased 2% to $457,000, and active adult was up 6% to $379,000. Average sales price in backlog also continues to rise, as backlog ASP gained 8% to $418,000, keeping us on track to achieve our previous guidance of full year ASPs above $400,000. As I mentioned, the $31.5 million charge for land impairments and the $12.1 million warranty charge were recorded in Homebuilding cost of revenues. Inclusive of these charges, our reported gross margin for the second quarter was 21.1%. Excluding the impact of these charges, our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 23.4%, which is 10 basis points below our guidance range. Margin performance continues to benefit from higher option revenues and lot premiums, which increased 12% or $8,100 over last year's $75,300 per home. However, sales discounts in the quarter increased 80 basis points over last year and 20 basis points over Q1 to 3.5% of gross sales price or $14,000 per home. The increase in discounts primarily reflects the actions being taken among the higher price points in select markets, where there's more inventory and consumers have more choices. We believe it is important that we keep our prices competitive to ensure we are turning our assets efficiently. Within this pricing dynamic, we still expect to realize meaningful sequential margin improvement of 20 to 70 basis points and resulting gross margins in the range of 23.6% to 24.1% for both the third and fourth quarters. Full year gross margin is now expected to be approximately 23.7% for the year. This guidance excludes the impact of the significant items recognized during the second quarter. Consistent with our focus on delivering strong operating margins, we continue to make outstanding progress on controlling overhead expenses in the business. For the quarter, our reported SG&A spend of $216 million, or 11% of home sale revenues, reflects the $19.8 million insurance reserve reversal. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter was $236 million or 12% of home sale revenues. Prior year SG&A for the second quarter was $256 million or 14.6% of home sale revenues. Based on the disciplined execution of our cost reduction efforts and our expectations for spending over the balance of the year, we are updating our SG&A guidance and now project that our full year 2017 SG&A will be in the range of 11.7% to 12% of revenues compared with our previous guidance of 12% to 12.5%. This guidance also excludes the impact of the significant items recognized in the first two quarters of this year. Adjusting for the significant items in the quarter, our operating margin was 11.4%, which represents an 80 basis point increase compared to last year, as lower SG&A expense more than offset the decline in our margins. Given expectations for margin performance in the back half of the year and our projected sustained 2017 SG&A leverage, we now expect operating margin for the year to be in the range of 11.7% to 12%. To ensure we tie in all the adjustments in the quarter, we generated land sale revenues of $8 million and land sale cost of revenues of $87.6 million, which includes the $81 million charge relating to the land assets we are planning to sell. Turning to our Financial Services businesses. Pre-tax income for the second quarter was $19 million, an increase of 11% over the second quarter of 2016. The increase in pre-tax was primarily the result of higher closing volumes in our Homebuilding operations and an increase in the average size of the loans we originated. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 79% compared with 81% last year. Continuing down the income statement, we recorded other expense totaling $16 million, up from $13 million last year. The increase was due primarily to the $8 million impairment of land held in a joint venture. Other expense in Q2 2016 included $15 million of costs related to the termination of certain land transactions and final costs associated with our corporate relocation. Reported pre-tax income for the second quarter was $123 million compared with $190 million last year. Adjusted pre-tax income for the quarter was $235 million, which represents an increase of 15% from the $204 million of adjusted pre-tax income last year. Our reported income tax expense for the quarter was $22 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 17.8%. Our tax rate for the quarter included the $24 million of tax benefits I noted earlier. Excluding these items, the company's effective tax rate would have been approximately 37%, which is consistent with our current expectation for the full year. Reported net income for the second quarter was $101 million or $0.32 per share, compared with reported net income for the prior year's second quarter of $118 million or $0.34 per share. On an adjusted basis, net income for the second quarter was $148 million or $0.47 per share, up 27% on a per share basis from adjusted net income of $127 million or $0.37 per share last year. Our Q2 reported diluted earnings per share was calculated using approximately 314 million shares, which is a decrease of 34 million shares or 10% from 2016, due primarily to share repurchase activities. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $240 million of cash, after having used $300 million to repurchase 12.8 million common shares during the quarter at an average price of $23.42 per share. For the year, the company has repurchased $400 million of common shares and has $600 million remaining on our repurchase authorization. As always, our decision to repurchase shares is subject to overall business and financial market conditions. The reduction in equity following our share repurchases in the second quarter increased our debt-to-capital ratio to 41%, which is just outside our targeted debt-to-cap range of 30% to 40%. At present, we anticipate ending 2017 slightly above 40%, but expect that future earnings will move us back inside our range. As noted earlier, we ended the second quarter with 9,588 homes under construction, which is up approximately 900 homes or 10% over last year. The increase is driven primarily by higher sold backlog units. Consistent with our focus on controlling our spec production, we ended the quarter with fewer than 500 finished spec homes on the ground. Community count for the quarter was 803, as the slow closeout of certain communities resulted in elevated community count relative to guidance. However, we still expect to end 2017 with year-over-year growth in community count in the range of 5% to 10%. In the second quarter, we invested approximately $236 million for the acquisition of new land positions. We approved deals representing approximately 7,000 lots in the quarter, of which 33% were optioned. Average deal size in the quarter was a little bit bigger at 130 \u2013 150 lots per community, including one new Del Webb position. And finally, we ended Q2 with 89,700 lots owned and 42,500 lots held under option. This moves the mix of lots controlled via option up to 32%, while lowering our years of owned lots to less than 4.4 years. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan for some final comments on market conditions. Ryan? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. With the low interest rate environment helping first-time buyer demand, along with supportive economic and demographic trends, we're positive on housing demand over the near and mid-term. We fully appreciate, however, that the economic and housing recoveries are getting long by historic standards, so we remain disciplined in how and where we're investing our capital and how we run our operations day to day. As sign-ups in the quarter and for the first half of 2017 demonstrate, we continue to operate within favorable demand conditions. At a high level, the market conditions we experienced during the quarter were as follows. Demand in our Northeast, Southeast and Florida markets was strong throughout the quarter, although as I mentioned, higher price points in some markets are increasingly competitive. Still, we've been very pleased with the traffic and conversion rates in these areas in the first half of the year. We continue to see very good buyer demand in our Midwest and Texas markets. Texas, in particular, is doing well and this includes Houston, which continues to deliver consistent traffic in the face of volatile conditions for the oil industry. And out West, demand conditions are still very strong across essentially all of the geographies, with notable strength in Nevada, Northern California and Arizona. Nevada's results include the opening of Reverence, a community of almost 900 home sites in the Summerlin master plan, which experienced exceptional demand when it grand opened in early June. Looking into the third quarter, demand in the first few weeks of July has demonstrated nominal seasonal patterns consistent with the positive environment we operated in the first and second quarters of 2017. We've had a great start to the year, and I want to thank our employees who've made that happen. They've done a superb job in delivering both an exceptional experience to our homebuyers and excellent financial results for our shareholders. Now, let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Ryan. We will now open the call for questions, so that we can speak to as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Savannah, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our first question from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Thanks. So, yeah, first I just wanted to ask about the gross margins. They're pretty close to the range in the second quarter, but you mentioned that the trends in the back half might be a little bit lower than you'd previously expected. Just wondering if you could just break down the drivers for us, and specifically I was looking for where \u2013 which division has the compression or which brand has the compression come in? And you mentioned a little bit of the higher price points, some pricing pressures in the second quarter, and maybe if you can tie that and how much that's affecting the second half as well, please. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Nishu, this is Ryan. Thanks for the question. We're really pleased with how the business is performing. We like the current operating environment that we're in. As I think Bob noted, we're seeing nice margin improvement as we move throughout the year. We saw sequential improvement moving from Q1 to Q2, and we anticipate that to continue into the back half of the year. So, I think that's representative and indicative of the favorable market dynamics that we're currently operating in. As it relates to some of the margin compression that we alluded to, we saw an incremental amount of discounting as we moved from Q1 to Q2, somewhere in the order of about 20 basis points. So, it was enough to move the needle a bit. But by no means what I overreact to it and it was \u2013 as far as the brands go, it was in the Pulte brands, which is typically where our higher price points, that's the brand that we house our higher price points in. It was a few specific communities in a couple of markets within the Southeast part of the United States. So, again, I just reiterate how positive we are on the market and the strength that we're seeing with the overall margin profile of the business. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Got it. Thank you. And on absorptions, if your community count had, I think, come in closer to what the expectations had been and some of those slower sell-out communities had sold out as scheduled, the absorptions would have looked a little bit better than expected, I believe. And so looking forward, as some of these committees begin to sell out, does that imply maybe the potential for some absorption bump on an overall basis? Or how should we be thinking about that? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Nishu, this is Ryan again. Certainly the numbers that you've got in the numerator and the denominator, when it comes to community absorptions, it can really move the numbers. We have had some slower closeouts of some communities that we thought would have been gone by now. And we're working to move through those. And as Bob indicated, our expectation is that they'll be gone by the end of the year, and our community count guide will be in that 5% to 10% range year-over-year that we'd previously provided. Just to give you an idea of how sensitive it can be, when I went in and I looked at the detail of what was going on with our committee counts, we had, as an example, four communities that had a grand total of about eight sign-ups. If you took those four communities out of the numerator and the denominator, our per community absorptions would have essentially been flat. Again, I'd talk about the strength of the overall business, the 12% order growth that we saw in the second quarter was really strong. We're very pleased with that. And as Bob noted in his prepared remarks, at overall community absorptions of 2.7 per community, we like how the business is running. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from John Lovallo from Bank of America. John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. First question, I guess, would be on the SG&A performance in the quarter, which was much better than what we were expecting. Can you maybe help us think about some of the major kind of drivers in the quarter? Was there anything quirky in the adjusted SG&A number of $236 million? And then, I would have thought that maybe there could have been a little bit more upside in the outlook for SG&A. What's driving kind of the increase in the back half? Is it just community count? Or is there anything else going on? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, John, this is Ryan. I'll give you just a couple of pieces and then I'll let Bob give you some incremental color on some of the details. But as far as what was in the adjusted numbers, no, the adjusted numbers, there's nothing quirky or unusual. It's reflective of the changes that we made really starting in the back half of last year, and that's continued to be a focus for our entire organization to run an efficient shop. As we move through the back half of the year, the increase will be completely aligned with the new opening of some of our new stores. We talked about before, we open about 250 new home \u2013 new communities a year, and the incremental spend will really be associated with the grand opening type activities that have slightly elevated SG&A, one-time expenses that are mashed up with those new communities. But other than that, we continue to be on the same trend line and the same level of efficiency that we've been on for the previous three quarters, and that's reflective of the full year guidance that we've provided. We had been operating in a 12% to 12.5% target. We're quite confident in the progress that we're making, and so we've improved and updated what that overall guide is for the full year, to that 11.7% to 12% range. So, I'll ask \u2013 maybe Bob can give you maybe just a tad bit more color on some of the details on the SG&A number. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: No, I wouldn't add anything. The only thing, obviously, since we've got commissions there, you've got more seasonal influence on the SG&A, so we'll have more \u2013 as we close more in the back half of the year, you'll have more commission expense and that's reflected on top of, as Ryan pointed out, the community activity. John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. And then, Ryan, in terms of your comments, making sure the business is addressing kind of all segments, I would assume that it's been perhaps moving a little bit more into entry level. Is that correct? And if so, does that mean kind of investing more in Centex? Or is there another strategy that you guys are thinking about? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. John, certainly, Centex is a big component of our first-time buyer business, but we've talked for the last several years about really looking at the first-time buyer could include our millennials, which in some cases we market to under our Pulte brand. So, some combination of Centex and Pulte targeted toward the first-time buyer and the entry-level segment. We are maintaining and sticking true to our underwriting criteria of investing, making investment decisions based on where we can drive the best return on invested capital for our shareholder, while balancing the overall risk profile that we're looking for. As we entered into the recovery two or three years ago, as I commented in my prepared remarks, that strategy really led us to more investment in the move-up buyer and, look, I think today's results are reflective of how beneficial that's been to our overall business profile, but as we move forward and today as the market continues to recovery, we're seeing opportunities to serve all buyer groups. And not only is buyer behavior reflective of that, the returns that we can underwrite to are supportive of that as well. John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we will take our next question from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Hi. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question, going back to the SG&A for a moment, continued progress there, and I think second time you've lowered the range expected for the year. And I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, but it's on a \u2013 your revenue expectations, broadly speaking, have remained pretty consistent. So, I was hoping to get a little help on just what's driving that incremental efficiency. Are there just better-than-expected cost takeouts? Or on a community level, are things a little more efficient? And where would you see over the next two or three years that number arriving at? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Hey, Mike, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. So, it's really in three main categories. We made some changes to the level of personnel that we are running the operation with in the back half of last year. We've been able to then change some of our processes that have allowed us to run a very efficient business with that level of personnel. So, not a surprise, the majority of our spend is in our people. So, a lot of the savings has come from that. We've also been able to maintain some nice efficiency at the subdivision level with the amount of money that we spend to run our individual subdivisions. We had a lot of cost-saving measures and process changes directed at that. And finally, I would tell you, and really give kudos to our marketing team. Our marketing team has done some really nice things with our digital marketing efforts to drive efficiency of spend there and improve our conversion rate when folks actually cross the threshold of our stores. We're seeing some nice improvements in overall conversion rates, which has given us great efficiency in the marketing dollars. So, those are the three probably big categories that I'd highlight. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Mike, the only thing I'd add is in terms of the improvement versus where we had set expectations, we had put these plans in place, but we candidly weren't sure exactly how quickly they would take hold. And to Ryan's point, we've made outstanding progress. And so we've been able to tighten the range. In terms of going forward, we'll give some color on that when we provide guidance for next year. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's helpful. Thanks, Bob. And I guess just then going back to the gross margin for a moment, I did find it encouraging that you kind of said it was more limited to a few communities and a couple of markets in the Southeast at higher price points. So, from a geographic standpoint, are we to just interpret that? And I'd be curious if you're able to give us color on which markets those were in the Southeast. But as a result, you're saying the broad swath of your remaining geography incentives and pricing patterns were essentially more stable, is that fair to say? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Mike. I think that's an appropriate characterization. The Northeast is an area that remains competitive, where our business is performing essentially in line with our expectations, but it is competitive. And I would characterize the balance of the country as strong. I highlighted the Texas markets. I highlighted the Midwest. I highlighted the West. Those are all some places where we're seeing nice strength. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And just lastly, real quick, sales pace by customer segment, I think it's something you've given out in the past, just the change for the quarter. Thank you. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. So, we were \u2013 absorptions were 3.4 per month at the first-time level, 2.1 for the move-up and 3.5, so on a comparative basis, down 6% on the first time, up 1% and up 1% on the move-up and active adult, Mike. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mike Dahl from Barclays. Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. As I know that specs aren't as much of a part of your strategy as for some others, but I was hoping you could give us some color on just how the spec margins looked in this quarter versus dirt? And how does that compare to the first quarter and maybe late 2016? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. We typically haven't given that level of detail. We can try and get you some stuff offline. Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. I guess what I'm trying to get at is another way of attacking the pricing angle, and maybe back to the prior comment on the balance of the markets being strong. Would you characterize it as kind of price-cost relationship, ex these couple of markets that you've talked about as being more challenged? Has that relationship improved relative to what you were seeing in the first quarter? Or is it about the same as far as what you're seeing? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: I think \u2013 I apologize, Mike, I might be answering the wrong question here. But our view forward with sequential margin improvement would tell you, I think, that the price-to-cost profile is pretty favorable right now. And obviously, the closings that we have in Q3 and Q4 are going to be the sales that we reported in Q1 and Q2. Operator : And we will take our next question from Robert Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys, good morning. You're crushing in on the SG&A, it's really nice to see. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Hey, Bob. How are you this morning? Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Pretty good, sir. Nice to talk with you. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Likewise. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just wanted to ask you, it sounds like a lot of operational progress, good visibility, Bob's tightening up the range, which is great to see. Nobody's talking about your land program of getting down to kind of, like, six years of supply split between options and owned lots. I was hoping you'd just spend a minute and go big picture a little bit and talk about the land strategy at this point in the cycle. And how you're adapting the strategy to drive return on invested capital? And I was also hoping you could give a little bit of view on how your land purchasing is evolving versus some of the long-dated assets you have on the balance sheet. How should we be thinking about this? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Bob, did I get three questions in one there? Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I was trying to beat Mike Rehaut, no. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Got it. All right. Well, let me see if I can address all of those. So, we are very focused on improving the efficiency of our land portfolio, and it's something that I outlined in some of my very first commentary once I came into the role in September of last year. We have put the three years owned and three years optioned target out there, it's something that I think we're continuing to make progress against as indicated by the current land inventory that we have right now. One of the big things that we did is, we took the comprehensive look at our entire land portfolio, and that is part of what drove the actions that we took in the second quarter with the book of assets that we intend to move through. So, that certainly was a big step in the right direction to get our land portfolio moving the right way. The second piece is, what are we underwriting at today? And, Bob, I would suggest and share with you that over the last three or four years under our underwriting criteria, the average lot size of communities that we've been buying has been in the 120 lot per transaction range. When we're running at about 35 or so absorptions per community per year, that's right about that three-year average. And you mix in the options and some of those kind of things, and we're very much moving in the path where we want to go. Now the difference is essentially the long-dated or the bigger Del Webb communities that we have that are performing very well, but as we've talked about quite a bit in the past, there's a little bit more land there. It's going to take some time. But we like where we're going, we're at 4.4 today versus eight years, not too long ago. So, pretty dramatic improvement in a pretty short period of time, and I like the trajectory of where we're going. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's helpful. And just for my second question, Bob, could you maybe talk about \u2013 in concert with the land program in place, you're finishing out your capital spending program on share repurchase, for $1.5 billion, this $300 million in buyback is pretty solid this quarter. How should we be thinking, in not just this year but for 2018, about capital allocation with any free cash flow? Thanks, and good luck. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. Yeah. No change on the capital allocation front, candidly. We've highlighted that we're targeting $1 billion. We've got $600 million left to get there. We've got that authorization in place. We always think about market conditions when we look at that, but obviously we bought a pretty big slug of stock in this second quarter, reflective of the cash position and the strength of the balance sheet coming into it. So, really no change. In terms of forward capital allocation, I think the process that we laid out back in, gosh, December of 2014, remains today the way we look at it. So, as long as we're constructive on the market, I know you've heard me say this before, we're going to invest in the business first and foremost. We're then going to pay our dividend, then we would look to buy back stock with any excess capital, all subject to that 30% to 40% debt to cap. We're a little bit outside that range today. Again, our expectation is that earnings will pull us back inside of that 40% target. So, in that mindset, we'll look at 2018 and beyond. We plan for multiple years, and we'll look at what the business generates, what we see in terms of opportunities, and you heard Ryan talk about the opportunities we're seeing across demographic and geographic markets. So, we're building our plans now. And in terms of capital, it means we're refreshing that which we already created. And we'll give more color on what we think we'll do in 2018 as we give our guidance with our fourth quarter earnings release. Operator : And we will take our next question from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Thanks very much guys. Really a strong quarter on the SG&A, let me just add my congratulations there. I didn't hear you all mention land spend number, maybe I missed it, but I was wondering could you give us the acquisition and development spend in the quarter. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Stephen. So, for the quarter, acquisition was $236 million, development was $373 million, so $609 million in total. That brings the total for the year to just under $500 million for acq and just under $700 million for development. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Okay. That's a kind of a tight number which will be consistent with your view. So, okay, thanks for that. I guess, I had a few questions, but let me just go head and just boil it down to one. Recently, there's been some action by one of your larger competitors on the land front in terms of getting in front of an approaching constraint in land development as they see it, maybe some partners on the land development side and the land financing side. And was curious as to your thoughts regarding both the impetus for driving interest in something like that as well as maybe something about that particular kind of structure as you've looked at that from afar. And then secondly, another one of your competitors has been pretty active in terms of making investments on the technology front. And so, I was wondering if you could sort of address those two areas of strategic thinking and positioning as you look ahead over the next couple of years. If you can maybe address just your \u2013 how you size up the landscape and what your response to that is? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Stephen, good morning. This is Ryan. Let me take maybe the first question for \u2013 the first question you asked about a couple of the things on the land front that one of our competitors is doing. I certainly don't have the inside information or baseball. I've read a lot of the things that are out there about the transaction. I certainly think it's interesting. Probably tough for me to comment on exactly what their strategy is and what they're trying to accomplish on it. Land is certainly a challenge that all builders face, and that is essentially the number one raw material that we need to continue to run our business. And so we are, like all of our competitors, looking to gain a competitive edge in how we acquire, entitle and develop raw land. So, time will tell, I think, on how that works out. We do put a lot of emphasis on acquisition talent and specifically entitlement talent. And those are things where we can really add value to the overall land pipeline that we're acquiring. So, I think we've got a really talented land team, and I think we're doing as good a job as any of our competitors when it comes to that front. As far as technology goes, Stephen, we're making significant investments in technology. There is a number of things that we're doing with how we run our business, whether it's on the way we market and run our website and the way that we're reaching out to our customers, there are certainly investments in technology that we're making there. We recently launched a updated new website in the last six or so months, and we're happy with how that's performing. We're doing a number of things in the way that we're building our homes, purchasing systems or things that we're looking to enhance our technology on, all the way down to what are the parts, pieces and components of things that we're putting into our home, making them smarter, making them more digital, allowing homeowners to have kind of control of their home, the same way they have control of many other parts of their digital lifestyle. So, it's a big beast to tackle for certain, but it's something that our entire team is focused on, and we're looking to make as many gains as we possibly can. Operator : And we will take our next question from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I appreciate all the detail on the margin and discussing what's going on in the pricing side. Two questions related to that. First on the tick-up in incentives, I'm curious if that was \u2013 if you kind of think about the handful of communities, it sounds like those occurred in, was that more in response to actions taken by competitors that you kind of had to match in order to maintain a sales pace? Or is that some actions maybe you're taking proactively to jump-start some activity in maybe some of those underperforming communities? And then the second follow-up to that, just on the cost side, there wasn't a whole lot of conversation about what you're seeing on costs. Curious how that's trending both materials and labor. And then just broadly in your conversations with the trades, how do you feel the labor environment is situated as we head into the back half of the year? We had a good selling season, obviously. Do you think the labor \u2013 the trades are really in a good position to get those homes built and delivered before year-end? Thank you. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Alan, thanks for the questions. Let me take the incentive question first. Not \u2013 I would tell you it's not an overreaction to anything. We're constantly evaluating the competitive environment that we're in and the inventory that we have in our pipeline, and we felt like there was an opportunity to be a bit more competitive. As an aside, you probably noted in some of Bob's comments, our finished inventory came down from prior quarter. And so certainly, I think some of those incremental incentives helped to move through some finished inventory that we had. Nothing that we did \u2013 we're looking at \u2013 we're always looking at the competitive environment, including our other competitors and you've got to be responsive to that, but not any kind of a significant trend that I would point to. And then on the cost front, we've previously provided guidance that our cost estimates were in the 1.5% to 2% range. We're still operating within that range. Labor is the piece that is getting tighter and \u2013 or is running a little hotter, which would arguably push us to the higher end of that 1.5 to 2 points, especially as we move into the back half of the year. As you mentioned, it's been a strong selling season, there's a lot of volume in the system. While we've seen some nice gains in labor, labor is still the piece that remains tight. On the commodity side, concrete and lumber are the two pieces that I would point to. Concrete is not something that we can buy at a national level, it's typically something that we're acquiring at a regional level, at best. And then, on the lumber side, we had the Canadian lumber tariff in the first quarter. And then in current time, there're a number of forest fires in the Canadian province that are creating some logistical challenges with the mills. Our expectation is that'll continue to put some pressure on the back half as well, which will push us to the higher end of that 1.5 to 2 points we've been operating in. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: I appreciate that, Ryan. So, just to be clear then, it sounds like at least part of the revised view on the margins is probably somewhat cost driven as well. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Correct. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Okay. Perfect. Thanks guys. Good luck. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thank you. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning guys. Ryan, you've been in your job roughly a year give or take now and as you look at the company versus maybe your vision, where do you think you stand with? And then as you look out over the next few years, what are your key objectives of where you want to drive the company? I mean, you've talked some about the returns and all that, but I was thinking maybe a notch below it, and what are some of the key drivers you think you need to put in place to move the company to where you want it to go. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Stephen. Thanks for the question, and what I would tell you is, it's been a great year. I think we've made tremendous progress. We've got an unbelievable company with a rich history. We've got wonderful employees that, I think, are doing just a marvelous job executing the strategy that we've laid out. Some of the tweaks that I articulated, that I wanted to see us modify and change, I wanted to see us own less land and get to a three and three mix, and I think we're clearly taking some steps in that direction. We made a giant step with the announcement of the changes that we intended to make to our overall land portfolio in moving through some long-dated assets that frankly just didn't fit within our portfolio and weren't aligned with our current strategy. So, harvesting that cash and redeploying it into high returning projects, I think, is going to be a great step for the organization as well. I'd like to see us be a little more balanced in the consumers that we're serving. We're making nice progress in that. I like the traction that we're getting. We've seen a slight uptick in the number of first-time and entry-level projects that we're able to invest in, which are being supported by the returns. So, everything is coming together on that front. I also really like to focus that our team has put on running a more predictable and efficient operation. I think as evidenced by two really solid quarters of home deliveries, I like the way that our construction operation is building and getting homes closed. We've had a tremendous focus on quality and taking care of our customer. And I think that is paying us nice dividends today. It'll pay us huge dividends into the future, as our reputation continues to be enhanced and improved by really taking care of the customer, creating a great customer experience and building a superior quality home, all things that our teams are focused on. So, Stephen, we've had great success. I'm really energized and excited about the trajectory of the company. I like the land deals that we're buying. There's a lot of real positivity happening out there in our field right now, and it's going to be an exciting ride. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. That's great. That's very helpful for me. And you look at \u2013 you've talked about demand quite a bit and, I guess, as you look at the cycle, it sounds like you all see it lasting several more years. As you look at your split between active adult, entry-level, move-up, you want to get it more balanced. How long do you think it takes you to get to where you're balanced in that? And, I guess, involved with that has a lot to do with entry-level and how quickly you can drive it. Are you seeing most \u2013 the biggest chunk of your deals coming at entry-level today? And is mortgage availability \u2013 I guess the question is, how do you get entry-level to be a more balanced piece of your business, both the mortgage availability, the deals you're doing, the product that you're putting on the ground and the competition that's out there? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Stephen, it's going to be a multi-year journey. We're not going to swing the pendulum to the other side overnight, and nor would we want to. The intent is that we're running a balanced approach every single day and by doing that, it's going to take time to evolve the entire portfolio. So, I think patience here is truly going to be a virtue. More so than trying to hit specific metrics and what percentage of a certain buyer group that we have, we're looking to run the best possible business that we can, drive the best return for our shareholders. And that's the playbook that, I think, we're executing quite effectively. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Stephen, the only thing I'd add to that is, to your question, are we doing more deals, yeah, we are, actually. And I think if you think of the way we've positioned the way we buy land, we seek return. The increasing velocity that we're seeing out of that buyer group makes some stuff pencil for us that didn't pencil in the past. So, we are certainly seeing some of that activity, and to Ryan's point, it will take a while. Just like it took a while for all that move-up business that we bought back in time to work its way through and it's a big shift to influence the total for the company will take some time. But, yeah, we're seeing activity with that buyer group, because they're more active. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, got you. Is mortgage availability improving there? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: I don't know that it's improving. I think you've got plenty of programs out there with low money down type activity. The QRM rules are what they are. I would argue that it was never that great a hindrance to that buyer group. There have been people who have said \u2013 a lot of them just didn't know they could qualify if they went and asked, they'd find out they could. So, I don't know that it's a big mover one way or the other. Because I think there is credit available for them when they're shopping. But price becomes an issue as it always has been for that first-time buyer. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got you. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : Hi guys. How are you? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Good morning, Carl. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : I just have one question. Morning. And you've talked a lot about a mix shift move over time. When we talk about markets, obviously, you've flushed some backlog of lots that have been sitting for a while; you've exited St. Louis recently or will be. Are you thinking, Ryan, in terms of looking at your geographic market locations and beginning to thin some out and reinvest? And I think that's just tied to the comment you made earlier about leveraging local efficiencies and scale better. Would there be a chance that you would shrink your market mix and reinvest more heavily in certain markets to grow share? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Carl, what I would tell you, scale matters. And we've talked about that for a long time. And market share matters. And I think you heard a little bit of it in my prepared remarks that we're working with our local operators to shore up and make sure that our market share and our scale foundations are solid in every single market that we operate in. If we find a market where we think we have weakness, we don't have the scale, we don't have the market share that we want, we're putting plans in place to change that. And in the event that we don't see a path forward, we will make the decision to leave the market. And I think you \u2013 that was one of the things that we saw in St. Louis. We felt that there was more opportunity to take that capital and reinvest it in other locations, but my preference would be to see us operate in as many markets as we possibly can as long as we can have scale and the appropriate market share to drive the efficiencies that we need to make our platform work. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Operator : And we will take our next question from Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Hey, Susan. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I'm wondering if \u2013 you noted that your recent land purchases have risen to about 150 lots per community, and that's a little bit higher than the 120 that you've been targeting over the last few years or so. Can you talk to how you think about that rise relative to your focus on driving returns, focusing on the margin side of things? And perhaps what does that imply for the sales pace as we think about this looking out over time? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Susan, I think in a small subset, the numbers can be a little bit, not misleading, but can lead you to odd conclusions. We noted that there was a Del Webb in there, which was a large lot count relative to the normal deals that we do. So, we put 7,000 lots under control. A pretty big percentage of that actually came from one deal that influences it. Similarly, you have heard us say that we have been doing a little bit more in that first-time space. With higher velocities, typically, again in a three-year deal, you're going to have a little bit larger lot count there. So, I don't think it's anything in terms of \u2013 we haven't changed our underwriting, our return criteria is still the same. It's not a margin equation for us, it's actually return. And so it's just a mix of assets that we happen to buy in this quarter. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks. And then just thinking about the 11% increase in the price that you saw in your first-time buyer segments there, can you talk to how much of that was mix shift? And maybe how much pricing power you're actually seeing among that buyer side? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: It's hard for us to break that down in real time. I would tell you that there is pricing power there, but there is mix in that, for sure. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Zeumer, at this time, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. We've run out of time for this morning's call. We will be available for the remainder of the day, if you do have any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and we look forward to speaking with you on our Q3 call. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead, sir. James Zeumer : Great. Thank you, April, and good morning. I want to welcome all participants to PulteGroup's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slide that accompanies today's call, have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We will also post an audio replay of today's call a little later today. I want to highlight that as part of today's call we will be discussing our reported results as well as our results adjusted to exclude the impacts of certain significant items. A reconciliation of these adjusted results to our reported results is included in this morning's release and within the webcast slides accompanying this call. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our results. Also I want to alert all participants that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today at our PulteGroup's strong third quarter operating and financial results. We continue to realize top and bottom line growth driven by the business strategies and capital allocation priorities we've executed over the past several years. As reported in this morning's release, even with the severe weather conditions in Q3 our 11% increase in sign-ups, 100 basis point increase in operating margins, and 40% increase in adjusted earnings per share attest to the strong financial performance we were able to deliver. Before we discuss our results in detail, I want to provide a few comments about hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the impacts they had and are having on our business. First and foremost, I'm thankful that we can say that all of our employees are safe and we're actually working to support members of our team whose lives were disrupted by the storms. In less than 48 hours PulteGroup employees contributed well over $100,000 which the company in turn matched to aid any employees impacted by the hurricanes. While I was not at all surprised by the outpouring of support it was still gratifying to see. We we're also fortunate in the damage to our communities in Texas, Florida, and the Carolinas was minimal. More specifically, none of our homes under construction, our models, or our sales centers were flooded or suffered significant wind damage. Depending on the specific market once the storm surpassed our communities were fully operational within a few days to a couple of weeks. That being said, the process of closing down and then reopening approximately 175 communities at various times resulted in the loss of numerous selling and construction days across multiple major markets. These disruptions were compounded by the resulting impact on the consumer in the days leading up to and after the storms. Rather than estimating the number of potential sign-ups that were lost we can tell you that the sign-ups in July and August were up roughly 15% over last year, but that increase fell to just 3% companywide for the month of September resulting from the disruptions in Houston, Florida and coastal Carolinas. Two takeaways from these numbers, overall buyer demand was robust in the quarter and the slowdowns caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma were significant. Customer traffic has improved in the weeks following the storm, but as I'm sure you can appreciate, the process of recovery has varied by market. One final point that I would like to make relating to the storms is that while trade labor availability has held up a little bit better than we expected, we are certainly incurring higher prices for that labor and the associated materials. In addition, municipal resources needed for permitting and/or utility crews to bring power to communities and homes have been strained. Fortunately, municipalities are beginning to wind down hurricane response activities which is allowing them to shift more of their resources toward builder related permitting. At the same time the utility crews are being freed up to work on connecting power to new homes. In summary, the damage from hurricanes Harvey and Irma could have been much, much worse, but we did and will continue to feel the impact on our business for several quarters. Despite the hurricanes, there are so many positives to be taken from our third quarter results. As Bob will detail, we continue to realize meaningful growth in our business with an 11% increase in sign-ups and a 9% increase in homebuilder revenues compared with the prior year. We were then able to compound this topline growth into 40% growth in adjusted earnings per share. I would emphasize the point that we are not just growing for growth sake, rather we are operating in alignment with our strategic focus on delivering higher returns. For the trailing 12 months ended September 2017 our return on equity increased by more than 200 basis points over the comparable prior year period and is now about 14%. Overall, we are extremely pleased with our third quarter and our year-to-date performance and with our third quarter backlog at a 10-year high we are well-positioned to deliver strong full-year results. Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for a more thorough review of our quarterly results. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Thanks Ryan and good morning everyone. As Ryan discussed, our third quarter results were impacted by the severe weather that disrupted our businesses in a number of important markets. Where possible, I'll highlight some of the areas of impact as I review our third quarter financial performance. Starting with sign-ups our net new orders in the quarter increased 11% over the prior year 5300 homes. It is worth reiterating that as a result of the hurricanes we experienced a meaningful drop in the year-over-year growth in sign-ups in September as compared with our business in July and August. Our reported Q3 sign-ups were also impacted by cancellations related to a fire you may have read about at one of our 50-unit low rise buildings in the Boston area. The building which was effectively sold out will need to be raised and rebuilt. As a result, 33 customers elected to cancel their contracts rather than wait 12 months for the new building to be completed. We are trying to find other housing options for these buyers, but these 33 cancellations reduced our reported year-over-year growth in sign-ups by about one percentage point. The fire will also impact future closings which I'll address shortly. Looking at 11% increase in Q3 sign-ups a little more closely, we experienced higher sales of our first-time [indiscernible] buyers partially offset by a decrease in sign-ups among active adults. For the quarter sign-ups among first-time buyers increased 24% over the prior year to 1611 homes and sign-ups among move-up buyers gained 16% [ph] 2443 homes, while sign-ups among active adult buyers decreased 9% to 1246 homes. The decline in active adult sign-ups was largely due to [indiscernible] in Houston, Florida and our costal Carolina markets related to the hurricanes. Adjusting for community count our third quarter absorption pace was up 1% over Q3 of 2016 and reflects a 15% increase among first-time buyers and a 2% increase among move-up buyers partially offset by our lower active adult sales. Turning to the income statement, home sale revenues increased 9% over the prior year $2.1 billion as we continue to benefit from the increased investments we have made in our business in recent years. These higher revenues were driven by a 7% or $25,000 increase in average sales price to $399,000 in combination with a 2% increase in closing volumes of 5151 homes. At 5151 homes closings for the period were below the low end of our prior guidance range. The lower closing volume for the quarter was primarily the result of hurricane related delays, with delays in permitting and other municipal approvals particularly in the West also negatively impact Q3 closing results. Breaking down our Q3 closings by buyer group, 28% were first-time, 47% were move-up and 25% were active adult. In the third quarter of 2016 closings by buyer grew by 29% first-time, 44% move up and 27% active adult. At quarter end we had 10,439 homes under construction. Based on our assessment of the current production environment, we currently expect to deliver between 6400 and 6700 homes in the fourth quarter. This estimate reflects the impact of lost construction days, trade availability and municipal processing capabilities in storm affected markets. Our Q4 estimate also reflects the loss of all closings from the building in Boston that burned and which had been scheduled to deliver in the quarter. As noted previously, our average sales price for the quarter was $399,000. The higher average sales price was driven by the modest mix shift toward more move-up homes combined with higher selling prices realized across all buyer groups. For the quarter, our average sales price of first-time home buyers increased 5% to $293,000, move-up increased 5% to $467,000, and active adult increased 9% to $390,000. Looking at our backlog ASPs also continue to rise increasing 10% to $431,000. I would note that geographic mix is impacting this quarter from quoted backlog as higher sign-ups from California, particularly Northern California, resulted in higher average sales prices. Looking at our margins our reported gross margin was 23.9% which is up 50 basis points sequentially from the adjusted gross margin we realized in Q2 of this year and in line with our previous guidance range of 23.6% to 24.1%. Our gross margins continue to be supported by our ongoing focus on capturing more option revenues and lot premium dollars wherever possible. For the quarter option revenues and lot premiums increased 8% or approximately $5600 over last year's $76,200 per home. In the quarter incentives as a percentage of gross sales improved 40 basis points sequentially from the second quarter of this year but were up 40 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. Looking at the fourth quarter we expect gross margins will come in towards the lower end of our previous guidance range of 23.6& to 24.1%. This estimate considers the impact of the storms which will result in the delay of certain high margin closing in parts of Florida, the loss of the building in Boston as well as higher labor and material costs being incurred in certain markets. Looking at our overheads, reported SG&A for the third quarter was $237 million or 11.6% of home sale revenues which includes a $5 million charge related to the resolution of certain insurance matters. Prior year SG&A of $251 million or 13.3% of home sale revenues included $12 million of charges for restructuring costs resulting from actions to reduce our workforce as well as costs associated with shareholder activities. Based on our strong operating performance and the increased leverage our overheads resulting from the actions we took in 2016 our third quarter operating margin improved to 12.3%. These results keep us on track to achieve our full year operating margin guidance of 11.7% to 12%. Note that this guidance excludes the impact of the significant items we highlighted during the first three quarters of the year. Turning to our financial service businesses we reported pretax income of $18 million compared to $21 million in the third quarter last year. The decrease in pretax income was primarily driven by a more competitive pricing environment for mortgage originations. Mortgage capture rate for the first quarter was 80% compared with 81% last year. In total, the company reported pretax income for our third quarter of $268 million which compares with $212 million last year. We also reported third quarter income tax expense of $91 million which represents an effective tax rate of 33.8%. The slightly lower tax rate relative to previous guidance was driven by certain state tax law changes along with a benefit from stock option exercises and other employee stock transactions during the quarter. Looking at the bottom line we reported Q3 earnings of $0.58 per share which represents 57% increase over our prior year reporting earnings of $0.37 per share. On an adjusted basis, the company's Q3 earnings were $0.60 per share which represents a 40% increase over our prior year earnings of $0.43 per share. Diluted earnings per share for Q3 was calculated using approximately 300 million shares outstanding which is a decrease of 42 million shares or 12% from 2016. The lower share count resulted from the company's share repurchase activities. Turning to the balance sheet we ended our third quarter with $197 million in cash on hand after spending $260 million to repurchase 10.4 million shares of our stock at an average price of $25.11 per share. Through the first nine months of the year we've repurchased $660 million worth of stock and expect to complete the targeted $1 billion of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. As always, our decision to repurchase stock is subject to market conditions. Consistent with prior guidance that our share repurchase activity would modestly increase our leverage in the short-term, we ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 42%. While this remains just outside our targeted debt-to-cap range of 30% to 40%, we expect to move back inside the range in 2018. I want to also highlight that subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we retired $123 million of bonds that matured. We also exercised the accordion feature of our bank revolver providing us an incremental $250 million of liquidity. Finally, moving over to operations, we had 10,439 homes under construction at the end of the quarter which is an increase of approximately 1,200 homes or just over 13% compared with the end of the third quarter in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by higher sold backlog units as specs fell to 22% of homes under construction. We remain disciplined with regard to production and spec inventory as we entered the quarter with only 576 finished spec homes. For the quarter we operated out of 778 communities which is an increase of 10% over the prior year and is in line with our guidance. As is our practice we will provide guidance on 2018 community count when we release earnings in January. In addition to our share repurchases we used $295 million of capital in Q3 for new land acquisitions. This brings our nine months spend to $773 million and keeps us on track with prior guidance of investing approximately $1.1 billion in land acquisition in 2017. During the quarter we approved 52 deals covering approximately 5,500 lots or an average of just over 100 lots per community. Consistent with our stated goal of wanting to be more asset efficient and return friendly, 46% of these lots will be optioned. Inclusive of the parcels put under control in the quarter we now own 90,400 lots and control another 48,800 lots under option. This increases the percentage of our land controlled under option to 35%. We're pleased with our progress as we continue to successfully build our land pipeline to support future growth while providing added flexibility and greater asset efficiency. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Bob. Before we open the call to questions let me provide a few comments on the housing market and the demand conditions we experienced in the quarter. The last release from the Census Bureau reported the seasonally adjusted annual rate of new home sales for the country at 560,000 which was little change from last year. Based on our results and feedback from our divisions we would tell you the demand in the quarter generally felt stronger than the government suggest and more in line with the 5% to 10% growth that many are forecasting. Certainly the hurricanes make comparisons in certain market specific analysis a little more difficult, but overall we're very pleased with the demand environment. As has been the case for the past few years housing demand is benefiting from the strength of the overall economy. Going forward we expect that the ongoing job and wage growth, high consumer confidence and historically low interest rate environment can support the continued growth of housing demand. And while interest rates have moved a little higher, I don't think that the modest increases had a significant impact on buyer demand. With an 11% increase in sign-ups it should come as no surprise that I would say demand in the quarter was solid growth across most of our markets. More specifically we saw generally good demand on the East Coast although cancellations caused by the fire in our New England division along with the impact of hurricane Irma in Florida will distort our reported results. Sign-ups in the Southeast were positive, although we are still seeing some choppiness at the higher price points in certain communities. In the middle third of the country we continue to be pleased with traffic and demand in our Midwest markets. The incredible flooding in Houston obviously impacted Q3 demand in that market, but overall we experienced good traffic and demand trends in Texas overall. And finally out West we would consider our Western markets to be among the strongest in the country with particularly high buyer interest in Northern California, Arizona and Nevada. Through the first few weeks of October we continue to see good buyer traffic with the typical seasonal patterns heading into the fourth quarter. We are looking forward to a strong Q4 and a continuation of the good demand conditions experienced through the first nine months of the year. In closing, I want to thank all of our employees for their tremendous work during the quarter. Whether you were taking care of our customers or each other I'm extremely proud of your efforts during some very challenging conditions. Now, let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James Zeumer : Great, thank you Ryan. We'll now open the call for questions so that we can speak to as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one followup. April, if you'll explain the process we'll get started with Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Mike Dahl with Barclays. Please go ahead sir. Michael Dahl : Hi thanks for taking my questions. Just starting off on the kind of the storm impacts and hopefully how things have progressed post the quarter, more really in the quarter, so two pretty different storms impacting Houston and Florida in terms of kind of types of disruption that we were seeing in damage. So could you give us a little bit more color on how you're seeing those respective markets recover if one is proceeding or rebounding faster than I guess your proactive Florida markets versus Houston, anything you can give us on how things were progressing over the course of September and early October? Ryan Marshall : Yes Mike, good morning, this is Ryan. As I mentioned, kind of at the end of our prepared remarks we've actually seen buyer demand rebound quite nicely in both Houston as well as in Florida. The damage and the implications for the storm were very different in the two geographies. I'll start with Houston, a lot of the work that's being done there is related to drywall, paint and trim and as we indicated in the prepared remarks we are seeing pretty good labor availability in terms of labor being there, but we are paying a little bit up for that labor and as we mentioned in our prepared remarks we've rolled that into our margin implications for Q4, but from a demand standpoint we're seeing that market recover pretty well. I'll move to Florida, the damage there was mostly related to clean up, landscaping, and the power grid. The power grid and the kind of the associated power crews that we need to energize new sites, hook up power meters, energize new homes, et cetera, that was definitely strained as was permitting and permitting related activities in the municipalities, because those community leaders were focused on storm recovery. We're starting to see that kind of break free and we're getting back into what I would characterize as a normal environment. Southwest Florida is one that I would highlight, it's a very big market for us, that's where the hurricane made landfall and some of the most widespread damage was in a broader sense and so that particular market from a buyer demand standpoint hasn't quite recovered where we would have expected it to. So I think I touched on everything that you had there Mike? Michael Dahl : Yes, you did and I understood and I know this is difficult, but if you look at the margin impact that you're forecasting collectively between the delays of high margin communities, the labor materials, the Boston community, is there any way you can parse out the relative magnitude of those and you know how we should if you have any initial thoughts on you know clearly 4Q is one quarter out but as we look out into 2018 how we should be thinking about those impacts? Ryan Marshall : Yes we didn\u2019t parse it out and it certainly has had an impact. But you know the guide that we gave at the end of our second quarter for the back half of the year was 23.6% to 24.1%. We had a sequential improvement of 50 basis points over the second quarter going to 23.9% in this quarter. For the fourth quarter we still anticipate staying within our guide, but as Bob mentioned in his remarks will be towards the lower end of that guide and that factors in the impacts we're expecting from higher labor costs and the loss of those higher margin communities. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Timothy Daley : Hi this is actually Tim Daley on for Nishu. So I just wanted to touch a bit on the capital allocation for 4Q and then kind of looking into 2018? So first I was wondering how much of the share repurchases have been done quarter-to-date through I guess October 23rd or 24th? And then secondly, I just wanted to ask about the land acquisition versus development spend that was guided to previously in the year and I think it was 1.1 and 1.6 respectively, are you still on track for that total to be around 2.7? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes, we haven't provided any update on repurchase activity in the fourth quarter. We did indicate that we currently expect to complete the $1 billion share buyback so that would obviously show that we're going to be buying during the quarter. In terms of the spend, yes we had just under $300 million of land spend brings us to just under $800 million, so we had guided to 1.1. We think we will be just around there and on development spend yes we think we'll be here the guidance we've given at the beginning of the year. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Lovallo : Hey guys it's actually Pete Gallo [ph] on for John. Good morning. Ryan Marshall : Hey John. John Lovallo : I was wondering if we could focus on Slide Six, Bob giving really good detail there around kind of the owned optioned strategy going forward and I guess just from a higher level is there any kind of timeline out there in terms of, how long it would take you just organically to get to that 50% option range? And then I guess part B to that question would be, is there any reason why you wouldn't target that closer to 60% or two-thirds kind of options over the long term? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, it's a fair question and I think we've been pretty consistent over time that when we look at optionality what we're really looking for is market risk transfer. And so it's not about putting money source between us and the land, if it doesn't transfer that market risk because that's actually too expensive. So what we really get down to is on an transaction-by-transaction basis are we able to affect a structure that actually serves both parties where we actually are able to manage our market risk by creating optionality and asset efficiency. So I don't know that there is a - we have to be at 50% at any one point in time nor what I say that we were targeting two-thirds or whatever, if we can get there great, but it really is sort of a transaction-by-transaction dialogue. Ryan Marshall : Pete, this is Ryan. The other thing that I'd just add in there is, one of the things that is, one of the things going on in the entire industry is land entitlements are taking longer and so part of the reason that we set the milestones at 50% owned, 50% options is I think it gives us the predictability of our forward business that we believe we need. It also takes into consideration the impact of our Del Webb assets which tend to run a little bit longer than a Centex or a Pulte branded community. So I think Bob hit the nail on the head. What we're really looking for is risk transfer, more option is generally better, but as governing guidepost for the your organization we think 50-50 is the right mix. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Michael Rehaut : Thanks, good morning everyone. I was hoping to focus a little bit on how you think about growth over the next couple of years and understanding that that there are different levers obviously to create value, but over the prior - before this year in prior couple years, community count growth was a little bit more modest or flattish. It started to increase or it's starting to increase, how should we think about 2018 and 2019 where you have different peers of yours kind of targeting maybe either mid, high, single digit or low double-digit overall volume growth? How does community count growth figure into that as I'm sure you have one, two, three year plans in place? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike good morning. This is Ryan. We haven't provided any guide to 2018 at this point as Bob mention in his remarks we\u2019ll plan to do that as part of our Q4 call. We\u2019ll give you some guidance ranges for next year including community count. I think you've seen from the land investments that we've been making that we've certainly been growing our land pipeline which as you know will translate into community count and volume growth over time. We have been putting up some pretty strong growth numbers this quarter being yet another one this year with a 11% growth and I think it's reflective of how we've been increasing investments into the business. We've talked for a while that we want to grow with or even above the market and so I think at a broader level that's how we're thinking about our growth prospects for the future is that we'll be keeping up or growing slightly faster than the market. Michael Rehaut : I appreciate that Ryan. I guess second question I apologize this was asked earlier, but in terms of labor materials in Texas and Florida how are those markets trending right now in terms of the inflation trends that obviously have been an issue even before the hurricanes hit? Obviously it's still probably pretty early days, but certainly wanted to get a sense if you have any intelligence on the ground in terms of any changes that you might have seen to the labor pool in particular and what kind of expectations that you might have next year in terms of any change in labor availability or cost? Ryan Marshall : Yes, so Mike, we're seeing generally pretty favorable availability on labor but we're paying for it, specifically in Houston. That's the place where we're seeing premiums being paid predominantly around drywall, trim and paint labor. We've been able to keep the labor on our job sites but we have had to pay up for it. A little bit of the same thing going on in certain parts of Florida, again the labor is there but it is coming at a premium given some of the recovery efforts. The one that I'd highlight Mike, that I think has a national impact which we're paying very close attention to is lumber. Lumber was on an upward trend even before some of the catastrophic natural disaster events that we've seen over the last 60 to 90 days. So that's the one that I think we all need to be paying attention to for 2018. I think the premiums that are being paid for labor in Houston and Florida that will subside in time. the lumber impacts could be longer lasting. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much guys. Can you hear me? Ryan Marshall : Hey Stephen, good morning. Are you there, Stephen? Stephen Kim : Yes, sorry about that, I had some technical difficulties there, can you hear me? Ryan Marshall : Yes, good morning. Stephen Kim : Okay, okay, good morning. Sorry about that. I wanted to turn the question to land spend and your approach to land and I was gratified to hear your answer to an earlier question where you indicated that it wasn't as simple as just simply talking about the share of your land in units which are optioned. I agree with that. It seems to me that, the best way to maybe think about it is in terms of land dollars spent. I think you had indicated that you spent $228 in the quarter for acquisition. I didn't get a development spend number. I assume it was probably around $500 million, but I wanted to see if you\u2026? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, to clarify it\u2019s 295 of land acquisitions spend in the quarter and development was $382 million. Stephen Kim : Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you for that. Okay and so that would bring you at about a low 30% of revenues which is kind of what it looks like you're going to be maybe spending for the year give or take a little bit based on what you indicated your goals were for the year. And my question relates to what amount of land spend do you think you need to maintain current sales rate? So I'm assuming like basically 15% revenue growth let's say. If you were to carry that forward and say we want to run our business to be able to meet that kind of top line what level of land spend would you need on an ongoing basis? Robert O'Shaughnessy: That's a hard one to answer Stephen because the mix matters, price points that you're buying cost of land in the markets you're looking at how much is optioned. So it doesn't serve to answer that generically. Right I know that\u2019s not a real answer for you, but it really depends on mix and how you're buying. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ivy Zelman with Zelman and Associates. Ivy Zelman : Thank you. Congrats guys on a strong quarter. Ryan Marshall : Thanks Ivy. Ivy Zelman : You know Ryan could you talk a little bit about affordability? We get a lot of questions about concerns with the strength of home price inflation. Are you seeing any pushback from consumers and we haven't really seen too much of it but obviously your markets, you're seeing strong demand? Are you seeing any resistance? And maybe thinking about mortgage underwriting and what you're seeing on the credit side is allowing any incremental consumer ability to buy pricing power despite pricing power, maybe give us a little bit of color around the horn to just talk specifically about Northern Cal which is one of the markets that you know we've heard a lot of concern around, Denver and some of the other markets in the Western areas seem to be the most concerning to investors? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Ivy good morning. What I would tell you around credit availability is it's generally okay and in fact it's gotten better over the last 90 days specifically with the GSC programs. The one exception to that is FHA. FHA I would tell you is unchanged. We are seeing more competition come into the FHA world from the non-banks. And that's helping a little bit, but in terms of credit availability on the FHA side it's unchanged. I think the False Claims Act, the prosecution if you will under the False Claims Act needs to be dealt with and until that happens I think that the bigger banks are going to continue to be hesitant in underwriting to the full availability of the credit box. So that's my broader comment on credit availability. We look at it clearly from the side of the mortgage company which we have an amazing mortgage company that Deb still runs for us and her and her team they're doing a very nice job. She helps keep Bob and I fully informed and what's going on in the mortgage world. When you look at it from the builder side of the business, I wouldn\u2019t say that mortgage availability or credit availability is impacting our ability to stop homes. That being said, we are seeing a little bit of resistance at the higher price points because of affordability and I think that's a broader concern that affects the entire business. There's a little bit more price opportunity at the lower price points, but that's also the buyer group that's going to run into a ceiling the quickest in that they have absolute kind of maximums in terms of what they can spend. So there are you know there are a few markets around the country that have been running hot and the premium between resale and new has grown larger than maybe what historical trends have been and those are places that I think from an affordability standpoint we all need to pay attention to. So hopefully that helps provide a little bit of color to what you're asking Ivy? Ivy Zelman : It does thank you. Let me ask one other cost question, what's your appetite around M&A given that we've seen some acquisitions and maybe strategic opportunities to get into either new markets or maybe bolt-on and existing markets, are you in the market looking and do you see attractive opportunities? Ryan Marshall : Yes, really no change in our appetite for M&A. I'd point you back to our capital allocation philosophy which we defined and we continue to reiterate. We want to invest in our business in new land acquisition and we've put M&A in that category sort of the extent that there's an attractive opportunity from a land pipeline standpoint and we think we give some added benefits from that acquisition we're certainly open to it. The challenges with M&A is as you well know are the integration challenges, but if the land opportunity makes enough sense I think you'll figure out how to how to make that integration happen, so no change in our appetite. We look at a lot of deals, but really no different than organic land acquisition. We want to make sure that it makes sense. Operator : And we have a followup question from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Stephen Kim : Thanks guys. Yes, sorry I got cut off there. No, no, sweat. Yes so I'm just going to move on to another question because it sounds like the total answer my question was in kind of the way you are thinking about things. But when we talk about the options which you do have, last I looked and again correct me if I'm wrong, it looked like you're putting down about 9% of the purchase price on your options. That's a number that I have here from your K and I didn't know whether or not that was the way you looked at it as well. And could you could just give us some context for what you generally put down on your options and if there's a cap on the amount that you're willing to commit to an option before you actually take it on your books? Thanks. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, I've not looked at it in the aggregate the way you just suggested, but the 9% certainly kind of fits within if you look at deal-by-deal. We're typically going to be between 5% and 10%. There are always unique circumstances, so we might go as high as 15% in some cases, but I don't think you'd see us north of that. Operator : Well take our next question from Bob Wetenhall with RBC capital markets. Please go ahead. Robert Wetenhall : Hey good quarter and nice job navigating the hurricane disruption. You guys did great on SG&A this quarter. There's a lot of cost control, how much runway is there on the cost side and incremental SG&A leverages we're thinking about next year? Ryan Marshall : Hey Bob, good morning. This is Ryan. Thanks for the comment on SG&A. It's certainly been a focus. I think we've done a nice job getting it tightened up. It would execute against the business plans that we put in place for the year. As far as continued improvement on that we're always going to be looking to improve the efficiency, but any substantial gains in the future will really come with growth of the business. So that's where I would look to it. We have done a nice job against the guide that we provided for 2017 and we're certainly kind of proud of that. We'll look to give kind of future guidance for 2018 in our fourth quarter. Keep in mind we did make the accounting change with commissions at the beginning of the year. So, our commissions are fully rolled into our SG&A spend at this point in time. So, I think you pull that out and you look at it in historical terms how we have typically have reported it. The gains are pretty substantial that we've made on the SG&A front. Robert Wetenhall : Yes, well done it's a lot of progress there. I hope it continues. I wanted to ask you as well about order growth in the West Region which was up over 30% and what's driving demand and as you're thinking about 2018 what are your favorite markets, where do you see the most strength happening on a regional basis? Thanks and good luck. Nice execution. Ryan Marshall : Thanks Bob. The West has been very strong. I highlighted in some of my prepared remarks it's really been driven by California. California, right now is doing well and I think you've heard that not only from us but some of our competitors. Nevada has performed very well for us this year as has Arizona. So those are the markets that are driving the order growth for us in current quarter. As far as markets for next year, my favorite markets are any place where there is strong job growth because I think when you look at the underlying fundamentals that will continue to fuel housing demand and housing growth is in those markets where we're seeing growing economies and added jobs, so that's where my bet would be for 2018. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jack Micenko with SIG. Please go ahead. Jack Micenko : Hi, good morning. Looking at the balance sheet into 2018 lands coming down you're running the three-three strategy. Conceptually how do you think or how would you force rank once you fund the business and fund necessary land development costs, how do you force rank buybacks dividends and deleverage beyond this year? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Jack fair question and certainly we'll give you some color on that as we release our fourth quarter we'll think about for 2018, but I think generally I go back to something Ryan said a couple of minutes ago, the capital allocation strategy that we put in place back in 2014 still drives our primary decision making, so first and foremost into the business to your point. Next we want to be able to fund the dividend through cycle, so we look at that candidly every quarter as we announce our current dividend we think about we want to do with that. That will be influenced by the cash flow we think the business generates in 2018 and beyond. And then if we have excess capital beyond that we'll buy back stock. I think if you think about it we've been pretty consistent with that and highlighted that we have probably pulled forward some repurchase activity over the last 18 months through the end of this year. So leverage becomes part of the dialogue. We\u2019ve highlighted that we're a little bit outside of the range that we'd like to operate in being 30% to 40%, so I think you'll see us want to get back inside that range. We've highlighted we think it happens in 2018 essentially through earnings. And then cash flow capabilities above and beyond that will think about how quickly we can and want to grow the business. If there\u2019s availability beyond that, we look at dividends and share repurchase, so same exercises we've followed for the last four years or so. Jack Micenko : Okay, thanks for that. And I think in your opening comments Ryan you said sales were running maybe up 15% year-over-year in the first two months and then you hit the headwind from the storms and in September you did have a pace of growth although modest but it seems like it would have been higher had the storms not occurred. So I guess the question is, are you letting the dog off the leash a little bit on sales pace or is that really more a function of mix? I'm just trying to get a sense of where we stand on the pace price debate that we're always trying to manage. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Jack it's a great question and to your point we ran 15% up in July and August which I think speaks to the strength of the market. September was 3% up and that was, in our view anyway purely driven by the storm related impacts. From the pace price equation that's certainly something that we pay attention to in every single community and it truly is a community by community decision that we make. Our focus is and always has been that we're looking to drive the best possible return that we can for the shareholder. In some cases that's going to be pace, in some cases that\u2019s going to be price, so I think we let the dog off the leash where it makes sense. We're looking for the best financial outcome. And I think all of our shareholders and investors should take comfort in that. In terms of maybe just same store growth or absorption growth, we are up 15% in first time which probably doesn't come as a surprise. I think the entire industry is seeing growth with that consumer group and we are as well. We were 2% up in move-up and then we are down 10% active adult and I really put that decline on Florida because we've got such a high concentration of active adult communities there as with Houston, we've two Del Webb communities in Houston and between Houston as well as the entire state of Florida that's a big part of our active adult business and that's I think what drove that 10% down. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen East : Thank you. Actually this is [indiscernible] for Stephen. Ryan, you spoke a little bit about lumber inflation, I was wondering if we could get a little bit deeper into what you're saying from a core excluding the storm impacts on material and labor this quarter? And then also if you could give us any kind of expectation on when we might see gross margins inflect on a year-over-year basis? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Well, we had given you guidance coming into the year that we felt we were 1.5% to 2% to your own labor input cost increases. We are still in that range trending higher and as Ryan talked about lumber has trended higher. You\u2019ve got the fires in Canada, you've got terrace, I mean there is a lot of things driving lumber rates up. For us that's next year business. The way we buy our lumber we've got relative constrained on what's going to impact our Q4 deliveries. So having said that we're still in that 1.5%, 2% range for the current year. We will give you some color on what we think it means for next year when we give our fourth quarter earnings. So at this point core cost increases are kind of trending where we thought they would be. The outlier to that is really the Houston and Florida markets that Ryan walked through earlier on the call where we are seeing some specialized labor input cost increases. Ryan Marshall : And Paul, I think the guide that we gave on margins for the back half of the year at 23.6% to 24.1% reiterates the fact that, what Bob just talked about with the 1.5% to 2% guide we are still right there, everything is trending in the direction that we thought and we've made the one-time adjustments based on some of the things that have happened or will pull us towards the lower end of that guide for the fourth quarter results. Stephen East : And you mentioned earlier on the call that you're ROE was up 200 basis points but that over the past 12 months, do you have a goal for that metric moving into 2018? Ryan Marshall : Well, we'd certainly like it to continue to move higher. We haven't articulated a goal and that\u2019s something that we'll consider as the full sort of guidance that we provide for 2018. Stephen East : Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please go ahead. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, good morning guys. Ryan Marshall : Hey Carl. Carl Reichardt : How are you? I wanted to ask about the land spend so far this year. I think $775 million is what you mentioned? Has there been a change in terms of new land? If you look at your current product mix, is your new land spends sort of matching that product mix split between first-time, move-up and active adult or is it changing? Robert O'Shaughnessy: I think what you would see is its changing. We've moved a larger percentage and it's not tectonic, there's a shift towards the first-time space with a little bit less emphasis on move-up. Ryan Marshall : And Carl, that really reflects some of the commentary that I think you've heard from me consistently over the last year since I've been in the chair where we wanted to be more reflective of what the market opportunity is and I think you're seen that start to happen. So to Bob's point, not a tectonic shift, but definitely a shift where we started to see increased investment in that first-time space. It will take time to move the entire portfolio given the size of it, but we're happy with the direction that our field operators are taking and assessing the market opportunity and putting capital to work against all buyer groups. Carl Reichardt : Okay, thanks. And then we've talked about labor and material price increases. Can you talk a little bit about the land inflation that you're seeing and maybe break it out by market? Is it shrinks as a percentage of the overall cost base which we have not seen very often I guess, I'm just kind of curious what you're seeing? Thanks. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, that's a hard one. I mean, I think the market is efficient and you've got everybody interested. So we are finding deals, but we are finding them also harder to underwrite quite candidly. They are - the market is pretty positive at the moment. Certainly and if you think about what Ryan said about which markets is he most interested in, I think everybody would answer that pretty much the same way and so the land in those markets gets bid up a little bit more. Having said that, we're still finding your return characteristics on the land we are buying having changed dramatically. So the market is pretty solid. I don't know that I want to say market A is up 1% versus another market. Each piece of land is different. Operator : And we will take our next question from Alex Barron with Housing Research Center. Please go ahead. Alex Barron : Thanks guys and nice job on the quarter. Just kind of wanted to see if you have any guidance on what the tax rate might look like for next quarter? Robert O'Shaughnessy: For next Q4 we've guided to 36.5% being our normalized rate. We were below that in this quarter. Its two things; one is there was a state law change that actually allowed us - but we booked a benefit because our deferred tax assets became a little more valuable because of the state tax rate increase. We also highlighted earlier in the year that there was a change in the accounting rules that benefits running through from stock option and stock transactions for employees which used to run through the equity section now go through the income statement. That actually drove our rate down, but ex- those two things 36.5% we think is still a good rate for Q4. Alex Barron : And as far as the increase in the price of the orders this quarter, I think you noted Northern California is one of the regions that drove that, but was there any other, was that also driven by some mix changes or was that just a general improvement in the overall markets? Ryan Marshall : Yes Alex, certainly mix matters a lot when you're looking at that, but you know the big driver was Northern California where the price points tend to run significantly higher than any of the other regions that we operate in. And our business there is more and more concentrated in the Bay Area which starting prices there start with 6s and 7s as opposed to 2s and 3s. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. One followup was on the lumber and maybe wood products more generally. If you said what the raw materials themselves are as a percentage of your total sales, so not including the labor and the installation affiliated with it, but roughly how much is lumber as a percentage of revenues if just looking at the lumber? And then maybe more broadly if you threw in structural panels and other wood products what would that represent as a percentage of sales? Ryan Marshall : Yes Mark. The range I would give you 7% to 10% of total revenue is what the lumber would represent. In terms of the material or the house cost piece it can run in the 15% to 20% range depending on the market. Mark Weintraub : Okay. I suspect that probably includes installation related stuff as well just to clarify? Ryan Marshall : That's correct it does. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And I will follow back up then, but and then second, I'm trying to think through that the strategy around pricing and pricing power. Do you look at it differently when for instance you referenced in Texas and Florida labor being up what you think is going to be on a temporary basis versus if you're going into next year and then you find that some of the materials are going to be higher for the year ahead as you put it in place. Do you think about that differently is how you then go to market and I recognize at the same time you're balancing this price versus pace issue, maybe a little bit of color on the thought process? Ryan Marshall : Yes the thought process is Mark, one of the things that we've done over the last three to four years, we've put a lot of investment into dynamic pricing tools and pricing strategy is part of our value creation efforts and our value creation toolset. And we've done a lot of work around dynamic pricing that has allowed us to realize some of the pricing gains and margin gains that we've realized over the past four to five years and we'll continue to do that. So certainly cost is an input. We pay attention to it. We do not price to cost, we price to the market and so what you're looking for is what is the market opportunity and what's the market's ability to absorb those price increases. So it's a little bit of a given and a take where we're certainly looking to cover the input costs that are going into the project. But if the consumers are unable or unwilling to take it, that's what you've ultimately got to react to. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes the only thing I would add to that is given the length of our backlog we have pretty good visibility into our input costs on the construction side of our backlog. So we're not out a year in advance in terms of the backlog and so the way we buy our materials is to Ryan's point we sell to market but we know our cost structure is going in for that. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Susan Maklari : Thank you good morning. Ryan Marshall : Hi Susan. Susan Maklari : Just quickly, you know I know that it's still kind of early probably, but have you gotten any sense from your sales people in Florida that there's been any change in how potential buyers perceive living in this day or they are looking to perhaps maybe little closer its away from the coast or anything like that following the storms that could perhaps on a longer term impact them from a psychological perspective? Ryan Marshall : Susan this is Ryan. I may be a little biased because I love the beach and I love the sunshine and I love the water and I think the majority of our buyers do as well. So I'd say that a little bit tongue in cheek. The simple answer is no, we have not seen any kind of a psychological impact in the buyers in terms of how they're thinking about Florida. In fact it may go the other way that you had what was a 100-year or maybe even a 200-year type storm event and Florida really performed well. The flooding for the most part was under control which I think is a testament to the way that we're developing communities and the way the drainage systems are working. From a wind standpoint your structures withstood category four, sometimes category five sustained winds and performed very well. Landscaping was really the major - the landscaping and power grid those were the things that were damaged the most. So time will tell, hard to predict what buyer psyche will do, but we are still bullish on Florida and I think the buyers will be as well. Susan Maklari : Okay. And then just building on that quickly, do you think that given the success that Florida saw and its construction codes and the drainage and all those things that you mentioned that there could be other areas of the country that use that as sort of a basis and start to adapt some of that, especially because with weather patterns changing it seems like drainage systems are becoming a bigger issue in lots of different parts of the U.S.? Ryan Marshall : Yes Susan, I hope that common sense prevails. The things in Florida while warranted are expensive and the construction codes and the methodologies that we use there are more expensive than other parts of the country. So I think you want all good things in measure. I don't know that you want to necessarily overreact and overbuild where it is not required. You know as far as drainage and water retention and some of those things, I'd point to Houston and it wasn't just our communities. I think you probably heard from all of our entire industry the newer communities performed quite well when it came to managing and dealing with the water on the construction sites especially in the newer development areas. So I'd like to believe that things are performing about as expected and as we continue to cycle out some of the older housing stock and bring things up to current code and current drainage standards I think things are performing pretty well. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to you, Jim Zeumer. James Zeume : Great. Thank you everybody for your time this morning. We will certainly be available throughout the day if you have any followup questions; otherwise we will look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's presentation. We thank you for your participation you may now disconnect.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead, sir. James Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Michele and good morning. I want to welcome all participants to PulteGroup's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slide that accompanies today's call, have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of the call later today. I want to highlight that as part of today's call we will be discussing our reported results as well as our results adjusted to exclude the impact of certain significant items. A reconciliation of these adjusted results to our reported results is included in this morning's release and within the webcast slides accompanying this call. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our results. Also I want to alert all participants that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. With that said let me turn over the call to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'm extremely pleased to report the PulteGroup's strong fourth quarter results completed a year in which we realized significant gains across a number of key operating and financial metrics. Gains that I would note were realized despite the significant challenges created by two massive hurricanes and one multifamily building fire in the Northeast. From double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines to significant improvement in the company\u2019s return on equity, we clearly continued to make meaningful progress against our strategic goals. Before I hand the call over to Bob for a review of our fourth-quarter results, let me make a few comments about where we want to take this company going forward. I believe that our decision to focus on returns at the outset of this recovery has driven better operating discipline and financial performance, while helping to lower the risk profile of our business. As such, we will directionally continue along the same strategic path but with clear acknowledgment that we want to continue growing our business while driving greater efficiency in support of strong cash flows and high returns. Consistent with our favorable view of overall housing demand, we have begin investing to began expanding our business at a measured pace. Our 2017 results again demonstrate that success of our approach as we grew home sale revenues by almost $900 million, or approximately 12%. As we remain positive on the housing cycle, we are continuing to invest in our business with a view towards growing volumes, while delivering high returns. Embedded within this approach is a sustained focus on growing volumes as we work to expand local share across all of our buyer groups. We and the entire industry continue to see strong demand gains among entry-level and first time buyers. That being said, consumer demand and associated opportunities can and frankly do vary by market. In some markets, yes, our biggest growth can be realized in first-time. In other areas, however, local supply, demand and competitor dynamics might dictate that share gains are more readily achievable among move-up or active adult buyers. We continue to make choices that we believe will drive the optimal business results and create value for our shareholders. We have a brand portfolio that is unmatched in the industry today. Our national brands, including Centex, Pulte and Del Webb along with our strong regional DiVosta and John Wieland brands have decades of experience on which to build. We will continue to use this to our competitive advantage as we serve the entire spectrum of homebuyers from entry level and first-time to move-up, luxury and active adults. This has been and will continue to be a point of competitive differentiation for PulteGroup. At 12.1%, our full year 2017 adjusted operating margin was absolutely among the industry\u2019s highest, and we continue working on our gross margin and overheads to help ensure that we keep it there. We can do this by expanding share within our operating footprint, where we have the best opportunity to drive greater construction and overhead efficiencies. In today's operating environment cost pressures are real, but we can always do more to maximize our gross margin opportunity. For example, while we achieved our initial targets on commonly managed plans we must work to squeeze out additional cost as we refine the process and redesign floor plans. Along these lines, we are currently redesigning our library of active adult floor plans. As part of this effort, we will use our comprehensive 12-step design process in creating these new floor plans, including consumer validation, value engineering and related [indiscernible]. We will then use this work to help drive the next round of efficiency gains. By deploying these next generation plans within our active adult communities, we can be in a stronger position to negotiate with trades and suppliers giving us a better opportunity to maximize our margin performance. We are obviously aware of our changing competitive dynamics in this industry, but we are confident that our construction volume of more than 20,000 homes per year but within a well-defined geographic footprint provides a strong platform from which to compete. I fundamentally believe that systemically growing the business can provide opportunities to realize incremental operating and financial gains, as well as create clear growth inside our organization. By growing within our existing footprint, we also give ourselves the greatest chance to drive additional overhead leverage. In 2017, our adjusted SG&A fell by 200 basis points to 11.5% of home sale revenues, but I believe we can do better as our business continues to grow. Bob will share our expectations for 2018, but know that this is an area of focus for our entire organization. If we can put more revenue through more efficient operations we will be in a position to routinely generate strong cash flow. In 2018 alone we expect this number to be in that range of $600 million to $800 million. We remain clear in our allocation priorities, so we can put these dollars to work in high returning projects, use them to reduce leverage or return them to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. From where we started with value creation, I think this next phase in its development is almost intuitive. Within a cyclical business, we want to drive appropriate revenue growth that can be maintained without getting too far over our [SKUs] or forcing us to take on too much risk. We are extremely pleased with the operating and financial performance we delivered in 2017 and we would tell you that we still have a lot of runway in front of us to get even better. Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our Q4 results. Bob? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Thanks Ryan and good morning. As noted in this morning's earnings release, PulteGroup's fourth-quarter results were impacted by several significant items. While we have provided non-GAAP reconciliation tables as far as the release and in our webcast slides, I thought it would make sense to start my comments by providing a little more detail on these items. First, we recorded a land charge of $57 million in home sale cost of revenues. This charge relates primarily to one project where we realized significant increases in our estimates for future land development and house construction costs. The project is in an area where competitive conditions limit our ability to offset our cost increases through higher sales prices. I would note that this action is different from the charge we took in Q2 this year when we made the strategic decision to exit and sell select non-core land positions. As a quick update, we have already disposed of more than half of the 5000 lots included among those assets at prices consistent with our expectation. Offsetting this land charge, we recorded a $66 million benefit in SG&A that is primarily associated with the reversal of construction related reserves. This benefit was largely driven by continued favorable trends in the development of our construction claims compared to actuarial estimates. I would note that we recorded a similar benefit in the fourth quarter last year. And finally, our fourth-quarter tax provision includes $181 million of charges primarily related to the reevaluation of our deferred tax assets resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December. Clearly the dramatically lowered corporate tax rates included in the new law will lower our future tax expense. More importantly, given that we expect to be a cash taxpayer in 2018 and beyond, the new tax law will allow for lower cash tax payments. I will address our perspective tax rate later in this call as part of my comments on 2018. Now let me move onto a review of our fourth-quarter operating results. Our net new orders for the period increased 14% over the prior year to 4805 homes. We realized growth in all of our buyer groups as orders among first-time buyers increased 23% to 1401 homes, orders among move-up buyers increased 13% to 2208 homes, and orders among active adult buyers increased 9% to 1196 homes. Adjusting for changes in community count, our absorption pace for Q4 increased 5% over last year. For the quarter, first-time active adult paces increased by 18% and 9% respectively, while our absorption pace among move-up buyers was down 1%. It is worth highlighting that the 14% increase in orders and 5% increase in paces represent our highest quarterly gains of 2017. We believe this demonstrates that housing demand continues to improve as it benefits from a number of positive dynamics, including the strong economic, employment and consumer confidence trends being experienced across the country. Looking at our income statement, home sale revenues for the quarter were up 12% over last year to $2.7 billion. Our higher revenues resulted from a 7% increase in closing volumes to 6632 homes, coupled with a 5% or $19,000 increase in average sales price to $410,000. Analyzing closings by buyer group shows 31% were first-time, 44% were move-up and 25% were active adult. In the prior year fourth quarter, 30% were first-time, 43% were move up and 27% were active adult. The higher average sales price for the quarter of $410,000 reflects a modest mix shift towards more move-up homes, combined with an increase in selling prices realized across all buyer groups. In fact, during Q4, our average sales price to first time homebuyers increased 9% to $326,000, move-up gained 2% to $478,000 and active adult was up 4% to $391,000. With the average price in backlog up an additional 12% to $442,000, we expect closing ASPs will continue to move higher. As we have discussed in prior quarters, geographic mix matters as our numbers reflect increased investment in California, particularly Northern California, where sales prices are routinely much higher. Moving down the income statement, our fourth-quarter adjusted gross margin, which excludes the land charge I discussed earlier, was 23.8% which is in line with our previous guidance. Our strategic pricing programs continue to enhance our margin performance as our option revenues and lot premiums in the quarter increased 6% or approximately $4200 over last year to $77,000 per home. We also continue to control our use of sales incentives, which at 3.2% of revenues, were in line with Q4 last year and Q3 of this year. Turning to overheads, our fourth quarter adjusted SG&A, excluding the insurance benefit I discussed earlier, was $268 million or 9.8% of home sale revenues. This compares with adjusted SG&A of $263 million or 10.8% of home sale revenues in Q4 of last year. We are pleased with the overhead gains we realized in the quarter as we drove 100 basis points of leverage compared with the prior year. Even more impressive is the fact that for the full year, we realized 200 basis points of improvement in our adjusted SG&A spend, which fell to 11.5% of home sale revenues in 2017. We continue to look for opportunities to capture additional efficiencies in 2018, and beyond.  Looking at financial services for the quarter, we reported pre-tax income of $23 million, which compares with $25 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the more competitive pricing environment for mortgage originations we have experienced throughout much of 2017 as our capture rate in the fourth quarter was 81%, which compares with 82% last year.  In total, our reported pre-tax income was $409 million in the quarter. On an adjusted basis, our pre-tax income was $400 million, which represents an 11% increase over our adjusted pre-tax income in the prior year. Turning to taxes, our fourth-quarter adjusted income tax expense, excluding the tax items I mentioned earlier, was $147 million. This represents an effective tax rate of 36.8%, which is generally consistent with our previously issued guidance. Our reported earnings for the quarter were $0.26 per share which compares to reporting earnings per share of $0.83 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. On an adjusted basis, our Q4 earnings were $0.85 per share which represents a 27% increase over our adjusted earnings per share last year. Our earnings per share for Q4 was calculated using approximately 293 million shares outstanding, which is a down from 328 million shares last year. The share count decrease of approximately 34 million or 10% of outstanding resulted primarily from our share repurchase activities. Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $306 million of cash after having retired $123 million of senior debt that matured in October, and repurchasing $251 million of our stock during the quarter. In total, we repurchased 7.6 million common shares in the quarter at an average price of $33.09 per share.  As of the end of the year, we had approximately $94 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. For the full year, we repurchased $910 million worth of stock. While just shy of the expected $1 billion of share repurchases, we expect repurchase activity to continue in 2018. To that end, today we announced that our board of directors approved an incremental $500 million of share repurchase authorization. We ended the year with a debt-to-capital ratio of 42%. As expected, this is just outside our targeted debt-to-cap range of 30% to 40%, but we anticipate that normal business operations will move us back inside the range by the end of 2018. Now switching over to operations, at the end of the year we had 8,856 homes under construction, which is an increase of approximately 1,400 homes compared with last year. The increase primarily reflects higher sold backlog as we remain disciplined with regard to the production of spec inventory. In fact, we ended the quarter with only 637 finished spec homes, which is essentially unchanged from last year.  For the quarter, we operated out of 790 communities, which is an increase of 9% over the prior year and is in line with our guidance. In the fourth quarter, we spent $311 million on new land acquisition, bringing our land acquisition spend for the year to $1.1 billion, which is consistent with our guidance. Reflective of our favorable view of the housing market, we expect land acquisition spend to grow by approximately 10% in 2018. I would highlight that our planned investment for 2018 did not change as a result of the new tax legislation. In the fourth quarter, we approved 50 new deals totaling approximately 8650 lots, including lands for two new Del Webb communities. These transactions bring our year-end controlled land position to approximately 141,000 lots, of which 89,000 lots are owned and 52,000 lots are controlled under option.  Consistent with our efforts to improve overall asset efficiency and reduce land risks by optioning lots we have successfully reduced our owned land to just 4.2 years, down from 5.6 years just 24 months ago. At the same time, we have increased our lots controlled under option to 37%. We are pleased with the progress we continue to make on both fronts. Before turning the call back to Ryan, let me provide our outlook on [indiscernible] in the range of $400,000 to $415,000 throughout the year. Consistent with typical seasonal patterns, this would include closing between 4250 and 4500 homes in the first quarter. Looking at our margins for next year, we currently expect gross margin for each of the quarters and for the year to be in the range between 23% and 23.5%. Margins for the year reflect the impact of higher land labor and material cost, particularly lumber and concrete, partially offset by higher selling prices. Consistent with comments we have made previously, we see opportunities to realize additional overhead leverages of volume gross. As a result we expect 2018 SG&A to be in the range of an 11% to an 11.5% of home sale revenues compared with 2017 suggested SG&A of 11.5% of revenues. The resulting operating margin range of an 11.5% to 12.5% compared with 2017 suggested operating margin of 12.1%. Although we are still analyzing the tax act and are waiting further interpretive guidance to complete the accounting for the act we believe our 2018 tax rate will be approximately 25.5% absolutely discrete items. As Ryan indicated, given the expected growth of our business have projected strong operating performance, we expect to generate between $600 million and $800 million of cash flow in 2018 before dividend and re-share repurchase activities. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, this capital would be available to invest in the business, reduce leverage and or be returned to shareholders. Clearly, our fourth quarter results capped at very strong year for the company and have helped us put us in an excellent position for continued success in 2018. Now let me call to turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. Before opening the call to question, I'll provide some comments on market conditions and broadly what we're seeing in the marketplace. With the 14% increase in orders supported by 5% increase in absorption phases for the quarter, I am showing appreciate why we are positive on the demand conditions we saw across the industry. Even though interest rates had started to creep up and the tax plan is thrown a few wrinkles across the landscape, there remain many positive forces continue to push demand higher. The underlying economy looks to be gaining speed and the tax cut has the potential to add fuel to this engine. Employment trends are certainly favorable and wages are showing some signs of growth which would also be a positive. Given the strong underpinnings, the potential for demand to expand further particularly among the big book and demographics of millennials and boomers is certainly very real. Specific to our business in the fourth quarter, demand trends in the East were generally strong for Massachusetts down through Florida. There was some uncertainty as to how the Southeast and particularly Florida would recover following the hurricane season but it's clear that demand has rebounded very quickly. Looking out to our mid-West and Texas markets, we are very pleased with the traffic and demand conditions we experienced in the quarter. Again, post hurricane in Texas we saw quick return of buyers to our communities. In the mid-West, we experienced stronger buyer trends and are working the balance sales paces against lengthening backlogs. And finally, the demand out West remain very strong over the quarter with Northern California, Arizona and Nevada continuing to show exceptional results. Through the first few weeks of January, traffic to our communities and buyer interest has generally been positive as is always the case. It'll be another week so until we are really into the spring selling season and have a better read on demand in 2018. Before handing the call back to Jim, I want to thank all of your employees for their efforts over the fourth quarter and the entire year. Your hard work is reflected in our financial results but more importantly in the quality of our homes and the service we delivered to our buyers. Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James Zeumer : Great. Thanks, Ryan. We'll open the call for questions, so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Michelle, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instruction] And our first question we'll hear from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Nishu Sood : Thank you. First I want to ask about the buyback. Obviously very strong indications of confidence, the $500 million for fiscal '18. I wanted to ask about the thought process behind that clearly reflects confidence in the business. How much did the tax reform windfall affect the thinking of that? Were you planning on $500 million already in the tax reform windfall just to support that thinking or did the tax reform windfall enable let's say a larger share buyback than you might have otherwise planned? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes Nishu, its Bob. I would tell you it did not influence our thinking. It certainly will influence our capital planning over the next few years because to your point it will yield fairly significant cash savings when we are a cash tax payer. But we were the dialogue we had been having with the board around this didn't really change as a result of that action in December by the government. Nishu Sood : Got it. And then secondly, I wanted to ask about the closings guidance. The 5% to 10% anticipated closings growth in '18, obviously it's in line I think with a lot of folks in the industry expecting. But in your case in particular, obviously you had a very nice end to the year in terms of orders, the 14% order growth. Also, your closings in '17 were depressed to some extent by hurricanes et cetera. And you would normally expect some rebound from that and especially since you wouldn't anticipate those types of events to happen again. So, how do I reconcile that the 5% to 10% versus the year-end and maybe some catch up on the deferrals? Ryan Marshall : Hey Nishu, it's Ryan. Yes, great question. I appreciate the question. What I would tell you is we did have a very strong end of the fourth quarter; we are very pleased with that. I think the fact that we delivered 14% year-over-year growth, some of that coming from community count growth and a big chunk of that coming from true absorption growth was something that we were very pleased with. We like where our backlog is at at the end of the year and it's really reflective of a couple of things. One, we've had heavy emphasis on increasing the size of our still not started backlog. We believe that helps us with our overall production models; number one. Number two; we're not building a lot of spec inventory. And so, with the strong fourth quarter we have a lot of those sales came in November and December but given our built to order model, those deliveries will not be in the fourth, in the first quarter of 2018. So, we like how our production pipeline is moving. We like where demand is at and frankly we think the 5% to 10% growth is very competitive and is demonstrative of the great year that we had in 2017. Operator : And next we move on to Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ryan Marshall : Good morning. Michael Rehaut : First question I had is kind of regarding more strategic I guess or over the next two to three years. One area of work that we've done recently is on return on equity and kind of in recent report looked at the DuPont approach and analyzing margins, leverage, and asset turnover. And I think for yourselves along with a lot of other larger cap names, you are clearly from a margin standpoint at a pretty high level. Your leverage you are at a little bit above the higher end and I wanting it to decline or decrease over the next year or two. And I think a lot of the builders are in general trying to maintain a pretty conservative balance sheet. And so as a result, asset turnover really becomes the focus I think in the next couple of years in terms of driving higher returns. So, with that said, how are you thinking about in particular, there are two areas I think that that could drive that and if you have additional thoughts, I'd love to hear it. Specifically, the lot option, the land position and also the sales pace. Two areas where we can really drive improve the asset turnover. So, how do you guys think about that? Are you thinking about that over the next couple of years to drive higher returns and if there are any goals that you might share particularly around again like the lot option or the sales pace to achieve even higher returns and you're already kind of at the top of the heap already. Ryan Marshall : Hey Mike, it's Ryan. I'll take a stab at the first couple pieces of your question and I will let Bob fill in few of the other components of it. So, first let me talk about land strategy and where we are going there. We made tremendous improvement as Bob highlighted in the script. We are down to 4.2 years of owned land. That is down substantially from where we were just 24 months ago and it's reflective of the hard work that we've done on the asset portfolio, specifically the land portfolio. I have been very clear in articulating our views about our land goals. We want to be at three years of owned and we're taking clear steps to get there as we have analyzed the assets we've bought over the last five years. Those new purchases have averaged right around 2.7 years of owned land which is very much in line with where we want to go. The difference being some of your longer dated Delaware positions which we have talked about in prior calls; we like the return profile we are getting out of those communities. They are just, they're a little bit longer in life. So, we are very focused in improving the land turnover and the asset efficiency as far as your question on sales paces. Certainly, that's the part of the mix. We look at it on a community-by-community basis and we're making the decisions with price and pace that we believe are going to drive the best return on invested capital which we've long stated is our number one focus. So, that's how I'd answer the first two pieces and Bob anything you want to fill in on there? Robert O'Shaughnessy: The only thing I'd add is, if you look I mentioned in a remarks our optioned portfolio is now 37% of our total land portfolio. If you just look year year-over-year, our owns position is down a 11% to 89,000 lots, our options position is up 18% to 52,000 lots. And so, while our lot position is only down 1% at a 141,000, we unbalanced we've changed the flavor of that sets our own position is down, we highlighted from 5.6% to 4.2% over the last two years. And the only other thing I'd add to that is there is a higher cost structure that typically comes with option lots. So, just I offer that people remember when we do this, there is some margin pressure that comes with that. Michael Rehaut : I appreciate that, thanks for the response. Yes, I guess, secondly, you threw out Ryan in opening remarks $6 million to $800 million free cash flow, I guess operating cash flow number for '18 and also the 500 million share repurchase a billion or the 10% growth in land span. Over the next, again kind of bigger picture over the next two to three years, is this kind of the playbook that we would anticipate in terms of 5% to 10% type of unit volume growth continue little bit of growth on the land spend and remain having the share repurchase continuing to be in the mix obviously not as prominent as the last 18 months or so. But still, all of those pieces kind of that moderate growth continued moderate return to shareholders positive operating cash flow. I mean, is this going to be the playbook for the next two or three years? Ryan Marshall : Well Mike, it's certainly our playbook for the next year. The next two to three years I think we're going to have to see what the market brings and we're going to make the appropriate decisions that we think are going to give the best result of our shareholders. We like the playbook that we're running right now. We think it's resulting in a very favorable outcome for our shareholders. We're driving good return on equity, its good return, and its great return on invested capital. We're demonstrating excellent earnings per share growth. There are a lot of positive things that we're doing. As I highlighted in some of my opening comments, I think that one of our opportunities is to continue to grow our volumes and continue to leverage the infrastructure that we built to drive even higher operating margin and push earnings growth through not only increased efficiency but also increased top line growth as well. So, we know that we're getting later into the cycle but we remain constructive on it. And thus that view is reflected in what we've laid out for 2018. Operator : And next move on to --. Ryan Marshall : And Mike, just to -- I'm sorry, go ahead. Operator : Please go ahead, I didn\u2019t know if you were down with your answer. Robert O'Shaughnessy: No. Mike, the only thing I was going to add to that is part of it's going to depend on what we do with the cash obviously. We highlighted that we can invest in the business. We can be lever to a certain extent or at least to our net cash or we can return at the shareholders, all of those choices will influence of the kind of medium term outcome. So, everything I agree with everything Ryan said and again part of it's going to spend on what we decide to do. Operator : And next we move on to Ken Zener with Keybanc. Ken Zener : Good morning, gentlemen. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Ken. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Hi, Ken. Ken Zener : Solid finish to the year. My first question is on speculative units. Could you comment on the spread between spec and non-spec margins? And my second question is going to be what would change your impact your view of how you use specs to enable a higher land turn. Because obviously, whatever you do to cash relative to taxes, that's going to be a choice you have. But in terms of operations, higher spec tends to lead a higher land utilizations which seems to be one of the elements you're pursuing. Thank you, very much. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes Ken, I'll start. Certainly, we see a margin differential typically in the 200 basis point to 300 basis point range spec versus non-spec and in particular we see it become more pronounced if we have spec final on the ground. We've been working to try and improve the production capabilities of the company and what we call even flow. So, we've been trying to build sold not start a backlog which we've been successful at. Doesn't mean we don\u2019t build spec. our spec production is up about 11% in terms of units year-over-year but our spec final is down 2%. I gave you the number in the release, in the prepared remarks, 637 units out of 790 communities. So, what we're really focused on is making sure we don\u2019t have a bunch of houses on the ground that people come in and say like let's make a deal. It is worth remembering that spec feels great until it doesn't. And if you get to a point where you have too many years on the ground and the market gets -- in the current mortgage timeline. So, I'll let Ryan answer the question more strategically but I think in general we're going to be pretty disciplined around this. Ryan Marshall : The only thing that I would add to what Bob shared with you, Ken, is we're not afraid to use spec. we're using it in the way that I think smooth out our production pipeline. Beyond that our view is our profitability on builder order units is quite a bit higher and we eliminate the risk of potential we have in the unit that we've got a hold on to and discount to sell or pay the caring cost associated with caring the finished house. So, it's all worked into our model of driving the highest returns possible. They're certainly multiple strategies out there in terms of -- how speculative units are used. We happen to be partial with one that we use which is working for us. Operator : And next, we move on to Mike Dahl with Barclays. Michael Dahl : Hi, thanks for taking my questions and nice results. I wanted to start with a question around sales pace. And I think Ryan, Bob, just given the focus on asset efficiency, if we look at obviously option trends over the past couple of years. It seems like that's been an area where there's still clear opportunity as we move forward through the cycle. I think you've articulated in the past that there's been some mix effects that are depressing what we're seeing a bit but you saw a nice return to growth in 4Q. Based on the closings guide for 2018, it doesn't seem clear that you expect that growth in absorptions necessarily persist through '18. So, I was hoping if you give us a little more color on how to be thinking about absorption for this year and then also if you have any color on community count growth expectations? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Well, the community count growth, we've often suggest that it's not the best measure of volume and since we introduced both annual and quarterly guidance, we weren\u2019t going to provide any commentary around that. In terms of our expectations for pace, I don\u2019t think we're expecting significant increases in pace in fiscal '18 relative to '17. We did enjoy a pretty solid fourth quarter. As Ryan has said, the first quarter has started off pretty well but it's still early going. We haven\u2019t yet really got to the selling season. Ryan Marshall : Yes. And the only other thing that I point out on the absorption pace side is mix and buyer mix certainly matters. I think it's no secret how we're positioned relative to the three buyer groups that we serve. We saw a nice increase and absorptions in the entry level which I think the entire industry continues to enjoy. We're very pleased with the performance there. We saw nice increase in absorptions in our active adult segment. We were slightly down in the move up. So, in totality across our entire platform we saw an increase of 5% in the quarter which is very robust and we're happy with it. And then I think when you look at the absolute number of our absorptions, they're very respectable, they're near the top. And so, just see outsized percentage gains given where we're operating, I don\u2019t know that I would necessarily expect that to happen unless the market was to significantly change. Michael Dahl : Okay, thanks. Then my second question is just around the impairment taken in the quarter on land and you mentioned that it was related to one project and an increase in development and construction cost. Could you give us some more detail on what exactly or where that land was and what was driving that uptick that makes it one off versus substantially broader issue? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes Mike, it's a fair question. Certainly this is an asset that's in the South East. It's a big asset, it's got more than 2000 lots. We're going to be there for a while. And what we've seen is the market around us in -- it is in Georgia specifically, has been very active. So, the Georgia construction markets really working pretty hard right now. We're bringing trades down to that particular site. And so, what we've seen is because of the strength of the market, our land development costs are going up, our house construction costs have gone up. And interestingly, this happens to be a community where it's positioned against some pretty inexpensive product we're priced, it's really price sensitive. So, we haven\u2019t seen much opportunity to increase prices, then in fact we've seen prices actually move backwards a little bit in 2017. So, although things contributed to over the last couple of years as the market has improved, our costs have gone up and we just haven\u2019t seen the price opportunity. Operator : And next we move on to Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner : -- To be in the spring selling season to get to that full year number. It's amended to the count guidance but I was hoping you could just help us a little bit. Ryan Marshall : Yes Alan, I'll do the best I can to who maybe answer that question again. We grow in the size of our still not lengthening the duration of operation. It's been a work in process over the last two years and we still got some ground left to cover but we like the position that we're in. We I think reflect, we're typically not into the official spring selling season until Super Bowl time. And we're I don\u2019t think it's a great proxy for providing expectations about what 2018 or the full review is going to look like closing guide which we think is reflective of our current production expectations for 2018. Alan Ratner : I appreciate that last comment, Ryan. Thanks for that. And then the second question, this year obviously to but the current metric when they think about underwriting that ultimately that excess cash is going to get competed away because you're going to be able to effectively spend more on land to hit the same type of returns threshold given the lower tax rate. So, I was curious if you could give a little bit of insight into how you think about underwriting land, whether it's an after-tax metric you focus on or a hybrid of pre-tax after-tax and ultimately how you expect those dynamics to unfurl in the industry in 2018 and beyond. Thank you. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes Alan, we've been asked that question off and on since the prospect of tax reform has been raised. We do not look at returns after-tax. When we underwrite transactions, we're looking at pre-tax returns. I don\u2019t expect that we will compete that away. I'm not aware of anybody that would look into this after-tax. Time will tell but certainly it hasn\u2019t been part of the dialogue with tellers at this point which is where you would probably expect the first year. So, not thinking that's an issue at all, honestly. Operator : And next, we'll move to Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Susan Maklari : Thank you, good morning. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Susan. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Hi, Susan. Susan Maklari : Obviously you've made a lot of progress on the SG&A front over the last year. So, have you sort of look out and think about the next kind of course of this cycle and Ryan you kind of talked too. So, what are you thinking about the next round of efficiencies that can come through. How should we think about where you can get SG&A and maybe what are some of the levers that can come in there? Ryan Marshall : Yes Susan, great question. We're so proud of what our organization has done in getting more efficient. We think we still have some room to grow. But as Bob highlighted in some of his comments, we're 200 basis points more efficient today than what we've been in a long time. And we wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that without the really hard work and diligence that our field teams have put into making our home building operations more efficient. So, a lot of good work behind this. As far as where we go in the future, it's really going to be around the volume growth. And so, part of what you heard from me in my prepared remarks was around our opportunity to increase revenue and grow or near to grow market share within the footprints that we currently operate in. That's where I think we can probably get some of our biggest gains. Certainly, we're always looking for opportunities to do things faster better smarter and we'll do that. But I think the majority just come from revenue growth. Susan Maklari : Okay. And just kind of building on that a little bit. How do you think about technology I guess and maybe some of the changes that are coming through across lots of different areas of home building from mortgages to maybe some of the supply chains and differences that can happen there? How can that maybe over time and not necessarily in the near term but thinking further out. So, what have helped and maybe take some cost out as we think further out? Ryan Marshall : I think the opportunity is huge and some of that we have already taken advantage of. The efficiency that we have got on the marketing spend side is been extraordinary. We haven\u2019t talked about it as explicitly as probably what we could have or should have. But the improvement in what we spend as a percentage of revenue on our marketing dollar from just five years ago versus today is a night and day difference. We've spent significant amount of money on our websites and the way that we communicate with and market to consumers. It's helping us spend the last drive more targeted traffic that converts at a higher rate and not all works into a lead, the pros spec and prospect to sale conversion ratios that are significantly improved and more efficient. Our marketing teams have done an extraordinary job in making that happen. On the systems side, we continue to invest a lot of money to make our systems more efficient. Helping us understand our cost better, communicate with our trades in a more efficient way and the really pull waste if you will out of the production system. There is a number of new technology platforms that we're dabbling with, that interface with and disintermediate with the sales side that I think have the opportunity to take some cost out were certainly those technologies are early in their development. We're testing some of them and we'll see where that ultimately goes. And then we're doing a lot of testing right now with virtual reality which is another thing that is showing early, strong early returns in our ability to help the customer ultimately envision what their end products going to look like. So, I think the industry is right for innovation. It's something that we're focused on, we're putting investments into and we'll see where it goes. Operator : And we'll move on to John Lovallo with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys, it's actually Pete Gabo on for John. Thanks for taking the questions this morning. Ryan Marshall : Hi. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, Ryan. Bob I was wondering if you'd be able to give any color around the cadence for the share repost in 2018 or whether or not that's just going to remain opportunistic? Robert O'Shaughnessy: That will remain opportunistic. We will not will be reporting the news as opposed to previewing it for you. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And any update, guys, on the Boston community that have the fire from last quarter, just where you guys are in the steps of remediating that? Ryan Marshall : Yes. It's we're in the process of rebuilding that building. It's already well underway and the build time on that building is about a year. So, it will be that building will be rebuilt and delivered toward the end of this year early 2019. Operator : And we'll move on to Jack Micenko with Susquehanna. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, can you hear me, guys? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Okay, Jack. And we know your name too. Unidentified Analyst : No, this is actually Salem on for Jack. Ryan Marshall : We know. Unidentified Analyst : No worries. Can I, actually want to start with an ROE target. I mean, do you guys have in our retarget you guys could speak to and maybe just talk to through some of the levers to get there? Ryan Marshall : Yes. We've not historically provided a target. We've talked about it. I think, given the size of the repurchase efforts over the last couple of years, it didn\u2019t make sense to set targets because of the magnitude and we didn\u2019t know where the equity price would be. As we've said before, we'll think about that and probably give you some color, my guess is that later this year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then, the second question was on gross margin. It looks like you guys are guiding to flat to slightly down gross margin on an adjusted basis, if I heard that correctly. Could you just maybe talk through some of your assumptions there embedded in there and is there an assumption of any greater shift to the first time buyer in that guidance? Ryan Marshall : Yes. This is Ryan, I'll take that one. And I think where I'd want to start with this is first we highlighted that our margins are expected to be 23 to 23.5 for all of 2018. That margin's likely still among the highest in the space and I don\u2019t think we should gloss over that fact. So, it is slightly lower than where we operated in 2017. Mix change is certainly can drive that but the biggest thing that's driving the change is we're continue doing till you incur lot labor and material costs. We're seeing increases. Not all of that are we able to pass on to the consumer. So, we're going to continue to focus on it. Our expectation is that we're going to continue to enjoy a fairly attractive margin profile in 2018. We need to keep an eye on where the lumber and concrete specifically go given that they're at very high rates at the current time. Operator : And next we move to Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Yes, thanks guys. Ryan, I have heard two things in the call thus far that surprise me, I mean, didn\u2019t contrast to what I'm hearing from the heads of the your two largest competitors. The first was your desire to manage down specs when D.R. Horton have been really pushing towards and extolling the virtues of standardization in their go to market strategy. And I believe in respect to that, you mentioned, I mean or as you and Bob mentioned the danger of having too many specs when the cycle turns down. But even there, I thought the lesson were in from the last down cycle was that the builders did best to able to blow through the land inventory quickly by building out their communities. So, I actually didn\u2019t think the lesson learnt from the last down cycle that having too many specs was the problem, rather I thought the problem was builders who's tried to tow the line on price and maximize margin and that reeled in a lot of bad land holdings due to down cycle. The second thing I heard that was different was leverage. Both the heads of the other two companies have expressed a serious desire to operate with the leverage significantly below historical net, got the cap level. And so, I was curious if you could sort of talk a little bit about leverage specifically and why you don\u2019t think maybe delivering operating with a significantly lower level of leverage than you start with, is a good idea. Ryan Marshall : Stephen, thanks for the questions. I'll take the first one on specs, I'll have Bob handle the leverage question, other than I'll reiterate the range that we've said we believe is most attractive for us to operate within. But let me start with the spec question and specific to standardization. I'd ask or at least admit that we not confuse standardization and the ability to be more standard and efficient in the operating production cycle with the use of spec. Part of our work with our commonly managed plans with our zone operations, with the lot of the work that we did to drive value engineering and should cost in gains. All of those gains and part of the reason that our margins are where they're at is because of the fact that we are standardized. Certainly we have room to go and room to improve but we don\u2019t believe we have to use speculative inventory to take advantages of those gains. As far as the adjusted cap range we've said for the last 3+ years that our optimal range is to operate within a 30% to 40% band. We have talked fairly openly that because of the very large share repurchase in 2016 and '17 combined that we are going to naturally accrete slightly higher than 40% but we would give guidance's to when we would come back within that range which we expect to do in 2018 through the normal course of operation. So, I'll let Bob pick it up from here and share a little bit more. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Certainly, as we talked about, we target a range that we're very comfortable with. If you look at our capital structure on top of that, we've got $3 billion in debt right now. A $1 billion of it has tenured longer than 14 years. The other $2 billion only $700 million is in three years. The rest is eight, nine years out. So, we have a very long dated capital structure at very attractive financing rates. So, to think through that, our interest coverage is very strong. To sit on cash and think about net debt, to me we got an unproductive asset on the balance sheet and we've talked about as we're going to use that either to invest in the business or to return to shareholders. Doesn't mean we would never hold cash, doesn't mean we wouldn\u2019t think about our leverage structure. But where we sit today, we feel really good about. And Ryan said exactly right, it's not for the share repurchased activity. We have a very low net debt to cap and a low debt to cap. So, we feel good about our balance sheet. And the business generating this $6 million to $800 million of cash flow this year, we talked about it earlier and even in the prepared remarks highlighted, we can think about leverage is part of that. Because we're going to have a lot of choices to make with the cash flow we're generating. So, I don\u2019t like to comment on what other folks are saying but I can tell you we've been pretty consistent and our capital structure is pretty sound right now. Operator : And we'll move on to Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Stephen East : Well, thank you. Good morning, guys. Ryan, you gave some lot of good information in your prepared remarks. And a couple of things stood out that I was hoping you could talk a bit more about both on product side. One the active adult, the second the entry level. You're talking about really going through a big process. It sounds like with your active adult repositioning product et cetera. Could you talk a little bit about how much of this is driven by the efficiency side of the world and how much is driven by the demand side where your acknowledgement that the competitive landscape is definitely changing is everybody or a lot of builders are trying to pivot toward active adult. So, just trying to understand what's really driving it and what you think the outcome is on where you want to get to on the active adult. And on entry level, maybe I've missed it but when do you see entry level was obviously your better performer just on a year-over-year performance. When does that start to grow meaningfully versus the rest of your business? I know, '17 and '18 weren't the targets but I didn\u2019t know if '19 we should see that as a percentage of total accelerate? Ryan Marshall : Yes Stephen, good morning. This is Ryan. Let me start with your first question around the active adult floor plans. And where I would take you back is the beginnings of some of the work that we did around our 12 step process back in 2012. One of the very first product lines that we attacked through our 12 step process and our consumer validation and all of the research that we did was with that active adult floor plan line up. It also happens to be the line-up that we get the most leverage out of throughout the entire country because we're able to use those floor plans in a very high percentage of our active adult communities. One of the things that we said with our focus on the consumer and getting feedback from consumers as they change what they want and how they live is that we would update those product lines very similar to the way I think you see the auto manufactures do. There are changes to designs and the features as technology improves, as the consumers desires change and that's exactly what you're seeing, that's to do with this active adult floor plan. We're really excited about it. And we have the communities that we can readily deploy these new and improved floor plans into. So, I think it\u2019s part of our process. It's opposed to saying that its demand or there's something else that's driving it or the competitive environment. It's part of the strategy that we laid out and we think that we're going to like the results that we get from it. And then, as far as part two of the question. Stephen East : Entry level. Ryan Marshall : Entry level, sorry I was I drew blank there, Stephen. As far as entry level goes, we're running the playbook and the strategy that I laid out about 18 months ago that we would start to see a shift of some of our investment in move up go in two entry level. As we sit in the land committee and we see the transactions that are coming through, we're seeing it. We've said that it wasn\u2019t going to be a dramatic overnight shift but you would see it slowly start to filter into our business as we appropriately index to what the market demand was in the individual market that we operate within. So, we like where we're going, I think we're already seeing more of that business in 2018. And I think by 2019 and beyond you would see this be for the most part right size to where we want to be. Operator : And that will conclude today's question and answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. James Zeumer for any additional or closing remarks. James Zeumer : Okay. Thank you, operator. We appreciate everybody's time this morning. And we're certainly available for questions throughout the day. And we look forward to talk speaking with you on the next conference call. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead, sir. James Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Barbara, and good morning. I want to welcome everyone to PulteGroup's conference call to discuss our first quarter financial results for the period ended March 31, 2018. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slide that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate Web site at pultegroupinc.com. We will also post an audio replay of today\u2019s call to our Web site a little later. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all participants that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We\u2019re excited to speak with you today about PulteGroup\u2019s outstanding first quarter financial results. As we will review, the company continues to realize meaningful growth and performance gains across critical operating and financial metrics. Heading into the spring selling season, there was tremendous focus on how higher interest rates would impact buyer demand. It seems the buyers were not deterred by the volatility in rates and I point to our 12% increase in sign-ups and 4% increase in absorption pace as confirmation. Even with the recent move, rates remain incredibly low by historic standards. At the same time, housing continues to be undersupplied relative to a variety of metrics, including the 50-year average for new home sales, household formations and overall population growth. Consistent with the trends that we\u2019ve seen for a number of quarters, buyer demand continues to benefit from strength of the underlying economy, a good job\u2019s market with low unemployment, sustained high consumer confidence and support of demographics. Against strong buyer demand is a generally tight supply of home, both new and existing in most markets across the country. Six months of home supply is considered healthy but we\u2019re seeing less than half that amount in a number of the markets that we serve. Within this strong demand environment our results demonstrate that we are continuing to successfully execute against our strategic imperatives as they relate to operational performance and asset efficiency. As Bob will detail in a couple of minutes, we generated 21% growth in home sale revenues to 1.9 billion, our highest Q1 revenues in over a decade. Consistent with our ongoing efforts to drive enhanced operational performance, we realized improving gross margins and tremendous gains in overhead leverage. Together, these contributed to 270-basis point increase in operating margin to 11%. Coming out of the downturn, we talked a lot about operating efficiency and taking more of a manufacturing type mindset with regard to our construction practices. Production efficiency is one of the reasons we focus on having a robust backlog of sold homes. This allows us to supply a more even flow of work to our trades without having to rely on the construction of unsold spec inventory. Building sold backlog on an even cadence is a lower risk way of keeping trades on the jobsite which is important given tight labor resources. While we focus on building sold homes, we do further in specs to help maintain a more even production cadence. And about 25% of our starts are spec homes. We then work to sell these units early in the build cycle giving the buyer the most opportunity to personalize the home to their wants and needs. Our manufacturing mindset is also why we launched our commonly managed plans. This is the practice through which we build a series of highly efficient floor plans across multiple markets. In the first quarter, 79% of our deliveries came from these commonly managed plans. You may ask why this is important. In addition to the gains and financial performance, we believe the production discipline associated with such an approach is critical to efforts to incorporate more offsite manufacturing into the construction process. As builders evaluate offsite production to help mitigate labor challenges, having a disciplined control process around floor plan management is a critical component to the entire effort. The ongoing operating and financial gains we have realized enable the company to more than double reported Q1 earnings over the last year to $0.59 per share. Clearly, we continue to make excellent progress as we work to be a more efficient and more profitable homebuilder. Given our focus on delivering higher returns, it isn\u2019t just about growing the income statement but also being more efficient with our balance sheet as well. We continue to make steady progress against our stated objectives by shortening the duration of our land pipeline while also increasing our use of options to reduce risk and support higher returns. Reflective of our ongoing efforts in these areas, I would highlight that 61% of the almost 9,000 lots approved for purchase in Q1 were under option. Depending on the ultimate composition of the land deals completed this year, we could end 2018 approaching 40% of our lots controlled via option and less than four years owned lots on our balance sheet. As a reference point of the progress that we have made back in Q1 of 2011 when we started this work, we controlled roughly the same number of lots approximately 144,000. Only at that time we owned 90% of those lots and they represented almost eight years of supply. In conclusion, I am extremely pleased with PulteGroup\u2019s first quarter results. The financial performance and year-over-year improvement delivered in the quarter clearly demonstrate the operating gains we have continued to achieve as we work to deliver high returns and long-term value for our shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for a more detailed review of the quarter. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. As Ryan stated, our Q1 financial results showed significant year-over-year gains in a number of important areas. Beginning right at the top, our Q1 sign-ups increased 12% on a unit basis to 6,875 homes and increased 18% on a dollar basis to $2.9 billion. By buyer group, sign-up increases over the first quarter of last year were 9% to 1,970 homes among first-time buyers, 18% to 3,294 homes among move-up buyers and 5% to 1,611 homes among active adult buyers. Adjusting for changes in community count, our overall absorption pace for Q1 increased 4% over last year. Looking at absorption pace within each buyer group; first-time was up 1%, move-up was up 9% while active adult experienced a slight decline as absorptions were down 3% against a very tough comp of up 17% last year. Looking through our income statement, our top line continues to benefit from strong volumes and ongoing price realization as home sale revenues increased 21% over last year to $1.9 billion. Our revenue growth for the period reflects the combination of a 10% or $38,000 increase in average sales price of $413,000 combined with a 9% increase in closings to 4,626 homes. We\u2019re extremely pleased with how well our home construction operation is performing. Thanks to a lot of efforts, we\u2019ve caught up on some hurricane-related production delays in Texas and Florida and we were able to deliver some additional California homes where final permits had been slowed. Given strong market conditions and high sales prices in California, the incremental closings there benefitted the company\u2019s reported revenues, ASPs and margins in the quarter. Looking at closings by buyer group; 29% were first-time, 47% were move-up and 24% were active adult. In the first quarter of last year, closings were 30% first-time, 43% move-up and 27% active adult. Consistent with our focus on limited spec construction and building sold homes under a more consistent production cadence, we currently have approximately 9,950 homes under construction of which 25% are spec. Given our current production universe, we expect deliveries in the second quarter to be in the range of 5,400 to 5,700 homes. This would represent an increase in year-over-year closings of between 7% and 13%. In addition, based on the strong sales environment, our first quarter actual deliveries and our expectation for deliveries over the balance of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for 2018 to be in the range of 22,500 to 23,500 homes. This is up from prior guidance of 22,000 to 23,000 homes. As noted, our Q1 average sales price was $413,000 which is up 10% over last year. The increase in our average sales price reflects higher average sales prices among all buyer groups, including increases of 17% to $323,000 among first-time buyers, 8% to $483,000 among move-up buyers and 5% to $385,000 among active adult buyers. Our higher ASP also reflects the increase in the percentage of our closings for move-up buyers in the quarter. It\u2019s worth noting that the average sales price of homes in backlog at quarter end was $441,000. Given our backlog at current market conditions, we now expect our average sales price for the full year to be in the range of $405,000 to $420,000 which is up from our previous guidance of $400,000 to $415,000. Turning to margins, I\u2019m extremely pleased to report that our gross margins in the quarter was 23.6% which was 10 basis points above the guidance range we provided for the quarter and which represents a 40-basis point improvement over the first quarter of last year. Our margins this quarter reflect the strong market dynamics Ryan highlighted along with the mix of homes closed and the focused discipline of our homebuilding operations. It\u2019s also worth noting that as has been the trend throughout this housing recovery, our strategic pricing methodology continues to drive enhanced profitability. For the quarter, option revenues and lot premiums increased 7% over last year to just shy of $78,000 per closing. As an additional data point, sales discounts for the quarter were 3.2% or approximately $14,000 per home. As a percentage of revenues, discounts were down about 10 basis points compared with last year. The support of pricing environment that exists in many of our markets is allowing us to effectively manage the ongoing pressure in house costs, particularly as it relates to the sustained high level of lumber pricing. As such, we remain comfortable with our previous guidance that we expect gross margins for 2018 to remain in the range of 23% to 23.5% in each of the quarters going forward. Continuing down the income statement, SG&A expense in the quarter totaled $241 million or 12.6% of home sale revenues. This represents a 230-basis point decrease compared with last year. I would note that last year\u2019s SG&A included $15 million of expense associated with an insurance settlement. Identifying ways to drive greater overhead leverage in an area of intense focus across our entire organization, we are very proud of Q1 results. Given the gains demonstrated in the quarter, we are updating our guidance on SG&A. We now expect SG&A to be in the range of 10.8% to 11.3% of home sale revenue for the full year of 2018 compared with our prior guidance range of 11% to 11.5%. Given our anticipated gross margins and overhead leverage, we now expect our full year operating margin to be in the range of 11.7% to 12.7%. This is up from our prior guidance range for operating margin of 11.5% to 12.5%. Moving on to our financial services businesses, we\u2019ve generated pre-tax income for the quarter of $14 million which is essentially unchanged from the same period last year. All of our financial services operations benefitted from the growth in our homebuilding volumes but more competitive conditions in the mortgage market impacted our mortgage pricing which in turn influenced our capture rate which fell to 78% from 80% last year. In total, based on our ability to deliver strong revenue growth at high operating margins, we reported a 61% increase in consolidated pre-tax income to $224 million. Looking at taxes, our reported Q1 income tax expense was $53 million which represents an effective tax rate of 23.8%. This is below our prior guidance of 25.5% due primarily to the impact of the equity compensation accounting standard we have addressed in the past. As a reminder, certain stock compensation-related tax attributes that were previously recorded in equity are now recorded as an element of income tax expense. As this accounting is triggered by the exercise in stock options by our employees, it\u2019s difficult to accurately estimate the impact of this standard on our future tax rate. Having said that, we\u2019ve continued to project an effective income tax rate of approximately 25.5%, excluding the impact of stock compensation and any other discrete events. Closing out the income statement, net income for the first quarter totaled $171 million compared with $92 million last year. On a per share basis, Q1 earnings more than doubled to $0.59 per share up from $0.28 per share last year. Diluted earnings per share for Q1 2018 were calculated using approximately 288 million shares which is a decrease of 32 million shares or 10% from Q1 of last year. The lower share count is due primarily to share repurchase activities executed over the past 12 months. This includes 1.7 million shares repurchased in this quarter for $52 million for an average price of $30.86 per share. We ended the first quarter with $185 million in cash and a debt to capital ratio of 42%. As we have talked about on prior calls, we expect 2018 earnings will have us back inside our targeted 30% to 40% debt to cap range by the end of this year. Let me address a few final operating metrics before I turn the call back to Ryan. As I mentioned earlier, we had approximately 9,950 homes under construction at quarter end which is up 21% over the comparable period last year. Of that universe, 25% are spec which is comparable with last year as well. We continue to do an outstanding job managing specs which we think helps pricing and margin realization. In fact, we had only 610 finished specs at the end of the quarter, effectively unchanged from last year despite the increase in our community count. Looking at our community count, we operated from 844 communities during the quarter which represents an increase of approximately 8% over last year. As we have discussed before, we do not believe community count provides a clear picture of the business due to the large variation in the profiles of our communities. Having said that, in response to numerous requests from investors we expect that our community count will increase in 2018 by between 3% and 5% on a quarterly basis compared with the comparable prior year quarter. During the quarter, our land acquisitions spend totaled $290 million which is up 20% from last year. Of the land deals approved in Q1, approximately 30% of the lots are targeted to serve first-time buyers with 49% serving move-up buyers and 21% targeting active adults. As we have discussed on prior calls, we are working to extend our percentage of first-time buyer communities, so this quarter\u2019s numbers reflect the timing of deals not a change in strategy. We ended the first quarter with a total of 90,000 lots owned with an additional 54,000 lots held through options. We remain focused on improving our overall asset efficiency as we control about 38% of land pipeline through options and own just under 4.2 years of lots. In conclusion, our Q1 financial and operating metric show the growth and performance gains we continue to generate. Beyond delivering great numbers for the quarter, we believe we have the business well positioned to deliver strong performance throughout the year. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan for some final comments on market conditions. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. Given the strength of our first quarter results, it won\u2019t be much of a surprise when I say we were operating in a strong demand environment for new homes. Even in a quarter that saw significant volatility in the financial markets and meaningful moves in mortgage rates, consumer confidence and buyer demand remain high. This demand environment in combination with a limited inventory of homes available for sale supports our continued positive view of the housing market. Looking at how these conditions impacted our Q1 business, even with the winter that seemed to never end, demand in the East from New England down through D.C. was strong throughout the quarter. Demand conditions in the Southeast and in Florida were equally robust. Even among the higher price points where we experienced some softness last year in the Southeast, we are seeing consistent demand for our Pulte product. In the middle third of the country, demand conditions were very good in the Midwest and down into Texas. Our Q1 numbers show sign-ups down in the Midwest but this was driven by last year\u2019s exit out of St. Louis and the decision to slow sales paces in certain communities to manage backlog and avoid any gap out on lots. And finally, demand in the West remained very strong throughout the region and across all price points. As mentioned previously, California remained exceptionally strong but we also experienced excellent demand in Arizona, Las Vegas and Seattle. The positive buyer traffic and sign-up patterns that we saw in the first quarter have carried through and into Q2. Even with all the geopolitical and financial uncertainty that is swirling around, we see sustained momentum that we expect can carry through the second quarter and the entire year. Before opening the call, it is important for us to recognize the recent passing of our Founder, Bill Pulte. Bill was a homebuilding icon and a visionary leader who impacted how the entire new construction industry operates today. More directly, he infused the passion for build quality and customer experience into the cultural fabric of this company, a passion that our employees embrace as we carry Bill\u2019s legacy into future decades. We will miss him. Jim? James Zeumer : Thank you, Ryan. You\u2019re right. Bill was an amazing individual. We\u2019ll open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Barbara, if you\u2019ll explain the process, we\u2019ll get started. Operator : Okay. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nishu Sood : Thank you. First question I wanted to ask about was on the strong start to the year from a cash flow perspective. How does that potentially influence the 600 million to 800 million I believe range that you had kind of laid out for the year on the last call? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Nishu, great question and obviously the incremental closings we think could provide incremental cash flow somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million. Nishu Sood : Got you, okay. And on the mix issues, obviously a very strong gross margin performance. I think this is your first performance in I think two or three years where you had an up year-over-year and so strong start. You mentioned, Bob, though the California mix issues. California remains strong. So did you bring that up to point out that there may be some giveback? Was that a temporary 1Q issue or given the ongoing strength in California would you expect that to persist? Ryan Marshall : Nishu, it\u2019s Ryan. We are seeing nice strength in our California markets both in Northern and Southern California. So we\u2019re very pleased with how the operations are performing there. The point that we are trying to make and highlighting Q1 is we had a few delays that we talked about in Q4 related to some permit and entitlement delays. The margins from some of those closings that carried into Q1 certainly had a little bit more of an impact on our Q1 volume and it had an influence on ASP and margins. So that\u2019s all we were trying to highlight there but we were very pleased with how California is performing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning. And I wanted to offer my condolences on Bill\u2019s passing. First question, you highlighted your shift or continued shift rather towards lot optioning with a hope that by the end of this year you could be around \u2013 hit the 40% mark and be under four-year zone. Provided the cycle continues and the growth projections that the industry continues to grow similar to what it\u2019s been and I would assume you would more or less try and mirror that pace, what could we see that number in let\u2019s say the next one to two years? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, great question and it\u2019s really just playing out the strategy that we\u2019ve been articulating for the last couple of years that in an ideal setting we\u2019d like to see a mix of about 50-50; 50% owned, 50% optioned. And I think what you\u2019re seeing in our results in the most recent quarter is that we are moving well along that path that we\u2019ve articulated. So we\u2019re approaching the 40% range. We think that by continuing to execute the strategy that we\u2019ve laid out, we can get closer to that 50%. It\u2019s directional in where we\u2019re going as opposed to hitting a specific number. Michael Rehaut : Great. Understood. And I guess second question just on the cash flow and appreciate the incremental quantification of the upside in closings that could result in another 100 million to that number. On that point and I\u2019m sorry if I didn\u2019t hear this earlier if you had touched on it. But with regards to the share repurchase around 50 million this quarter, given the increased cash flow outlook for the full year, how should we think about the rest of the year? Obviously you\u2019ve talked about share repurchase as kind of one of the core parts of capital allocation and with that number being even bigger and that\u2019s after taking care of your land purchasing needs, how should we think about the rest of the year in this area? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, I think as we\u2019ve talked about, we don\u2019t want to be targeting numbers going forward but we\u2019ll be reporting what we do. Having said that, we remain in the camp where we\u2019re not stock pickers, we\u2019re not making explicit calls on valuations. We look at the capital needs of the business. We look at the capital generation of the business. And so certainly if we project an incremental $100 million of cash flow that will influence our thinking. But what we want to do is over time be systematic in our return of capital to shareholders but with the premise being if we\u2019re constructive on the market and we are today that we want to invest in the business as long as we can do that at high returns. So that will be our primary view. So as we look at multiyear needs of capital and have not just what we have in line of sight over the next six or nine months, it\u2019s actually over the next two or three years. We worked together here and then with our Board to think about how much to allocate to share repurchases. And we\u2019ll let you know how we proceed with that quarter-by-quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore. Please go ahead. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much, guys, and strong quarter. Congrats on that. I wanted to ask if I could about your manufacturing productivity which I think you spent a fair amount of time, Ryan, at the beginning of the call talking about. You talked about the move to commonly managed plans and spec homes. I think you said 25% of your production. Was curious as to whether you\u2019ve looked at or contemplated other aspects of the business which seem to be emerging and specifically with respect to increased use of panelization and some of the initiatives or innovations that are going on there. Could you give us a sense for what percent of your closings used external panelization plants to help you build your homes? And if you have any sort of thoughts around the sensibility of making further investments in that area? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, I appreciate the comments and we highlighted it for a reason. We do think that it\u2019s one of the necessary elements that the entire industry is likely going to have to embrace to deal with the continued labor challenges that the industry is facing. So we\u2019re putting efforts inside of the organization at studying and evaluating how we can incorporate it and integrate it into our business for future success. I will highlight and note that there will be winners and losers as the entire industry looks to incorporate manufacturing. Our company has a long history going back some 20 to 25 years of innovation around manufacturing and vertically integrated technologies. And our Founder Bill Pulte was someone who was very passionate about innovations in this space. So we\u2019re looking at a number of different things inclusive of wall panels and integrated plumbing and electrical connections, vertically integrated trades. I think we\u2019re looking at the full complement of potential things that we could use to improve our operations. It\u2019s not going to be a one size fits all. It will depend on geography and it will depend on our scale in different markets and regions. And it\u2019s going to take some time. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight. So we can continue to run our business the way that we have been we think for the foreseeable future, but we do believe it\u2019s not a matter of if but when the change comes. And we want our investor base and our shareholders to know that we\u2019re putting some efforts around studying this and making sure that our organization\u2019s ready. The reason that we highlighted the commonly managed plans which we\u2019ve been working on now for the better part of five years having a more streamlined planned platform with high throughput we think is a big lever to unlock success or lack thereof around manufacturing. Stephen Kim : Yes. That\u2019s great. I agree with a lot of what you\u2019ve said there. One of the things that we\u2019ve thought about and I\u2019d be curious to get your perspective is if or when over the next few years you see an increase in this use of panelization technology, do you think it will influence the competitive advantage that the largest builders in the markets are enjoying relative to their competitors? In a way I\u2019ve contemplated that perhaps you might see some of the advantages of scale being captured by the factories which are making the panels and therefore they could sell it to builders large or small which would seem to flatten the overall cost advantage of the largest builders working on getting. I was curious as to how you thought about that evolution in terms of competitive advantage of the largest builders versus their peers? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, I think it\u2019s a great question and certainly scale matters and it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve talked about for a long time. You\u2019ve heard us talk about relative market share. And so I think volume, scale at a national level are certainly part of the equation. We frankly believe that scale at the local level is probably even more impactful and more important. As far as the manufacturing piece and if there are third party providers that are \u2013 if I understand your question right, those third party providers are manufacturers, they are the ones that will benefit more from the scale as opposed to the large builders. It\u2019s certainly possible. I think the question really becomes, are you making or buying? And we\u2019re looking at both alternatives where you may be buying panelization which may just purely be an unlock or a way to overcome labor shortages and challenges. The other side of it is we may be the manufacturer and that\u2019s certainly on the table as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning. Ryan, when you were speaking to some of the regional trends you\u2019re seeing, you said that in the Southeast you\u2019ve seen some pretty robust demand even at the higher price points. How much of that improvement do you think is driven by company-specific efforts or things that you\u2019ve done to the product relative to the broader market and maybe some of the impact of the tighter inventory that we\u2019re seeing? Ryan Marshall : Susan, I think it was more \u2013 the point that we were trying to make is we saw some softness in the higher price points in the Southeast a year ago in the same quarter. We commented at that point in time that it was really about a very local competitive environment, some of the communities that we were going head-to-head against at that particular point in time. We\u2019ve seen some of that softness dissipate and certainly the tight inventory that\u2019s out there is having an impact. That being said, I think it does come back to some of the broader fundamentals. Interest rates are still incredibly low. We\u2019re seeing a backdrop of a strong economy. I think all of those things are contributing to that price point performing well for us. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thank you. And then can you talk a little bit to inflation especially maybe as it relates to some of the materials? It sounds like that continues to creep up on you. Just maybe what you\u2019re seeing there? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Susan, it\u2019s Bob. We certainly see the same thing everybody else does. It\u2019s interesting. Lumber, which we had highlighted coming into the year that we expect it to see sort of follow the historical seasonal trend down has not. And so we see price pressure there. The lot labor market, as Ryan talked about, is still challenging. You hear about tariff-related increases on steel and aluminum. So having said that, there is inflationary pressure on commodities. The good news is that we\u2019ve seen a market that\u2019s allowed us to price to cover most of that. So we have guided I think 2.5% to 3% on inflationary pressure. We see that still every bit of it, maybe a little bit more depending on what lumber does over the balance of the year. But we still feel good about our margin guide based on the strength of our backlog and the strength of the selling environment today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Alan Ratner : Hi, guys. Good morning. Nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. So on that final point on the lumber side, you look at the random once pricing and lumber prices are up 20% plus and it seems pretty unwavering. Can you just refresh our memories here? How do you guys purchase lumber? Is there a certain price that\u2019s locked in for a period of time and then it resets or do you try to smooth out the fluctuations there because 2.5% to 3% seems pretty low in the context of at least the largest material up 20% on the spot market? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. We actually do buy on a trailing 13-week average price which gets reset quarterly. So we have the ability to do it at least in terms of production timelines is the lumber that gets delivered is going to be priced consistently with when we actually sold the house. So we sell the house, we\u2019ll build it six, eight weeks later. The lumber that gets delivered is going to be based on the pricing that was in effect. So we feel like we\u2019ve got some ability to control the cost input and related margin estimates on the backlog that we\u2019ve got. Certainly it\u2019s one of the primary components of the house costs. So like I said we\u2019re at 3%, maybe even a little bit above it going through fiscal '18. Alan Ratner : Got it. Thanks for that. And then second question, I know you guys don\u2019t spec a lot but you do spec some and you mentioned 25% of your starts are specs. So I\u2019m curious. In the last four months or so we\u2019ve had at least a couple of weeks where there has been pretty sharp moves in rates, including the most recent 10-basis point move over the past few days. Do you see any difference in behavior among buyers coming in looking for homes that might be a little bit closer to completion in order to lock in that rate when you see those movements in rates or has the buyer behavior really been pretty consistent through these various moves? Ryan Marshall : Hi, Alan, it\u2019s Ryan. What I would tell you with buyer behavior is I think when buyers go into the housing market, they have a need for housing that is being driven by changes in life events. And I think at that point in time they look at what they can afford based on the prevailing rate at that point in time. While we certainly have seen a movement in rates, we\u2019re still at an incredibly affordable overall rate environment which I think is the big theme here. And we still see lower margins on the spec homes that we sell which is one of the reasons that we prefer to sell to-be-built or dirt sales as we\u2019re more profitable on those. So whether somebody wants a spec or a dirt I think really comes down to what they\u2019re need for housing is. Are they coming out of an apartment, are they relocating, have they already sold their home, et cetera? I think those are the bigger drivers versus can I lock in a rate. The other thing that I would tell you is our financial services division, they do a great job of providing longer term rate locks which I think help to mitigate some of that fear. And then right now kind of back to the first part of your question, Alan, just in terms of how many specs we have in the system, it is about 25% of our starts and we have roughly 2,500 homes that are in some stage of construction that are specs. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Matt Bouley from Barclays. Please go ahead. Marshall Mentz : Hi. This is actually Marshall Mentz on for Matt. Good morning and congrats again on a great start to the year. A follow up on the \u2013 just a follow up on the manufacturing theme. You called out the percentage of deliveries coming from your commonly managed plans. I just wanted to understand where do you think that percentage can go from here? And what do sales from those plans mean from a margin perspective? Ryan Marshall : So, Marshall, we think we\u2019re about at the rate that we\u2019ll operate at going forward. We said all along our target was right around 80%. The other 20% that we build that aren\u2019t necessarily part of our commonly managed portfolio, those are in more infill, more difficult locations that require a specific unique product. So we think we\u2019re there in terms of the percentage that we get. In terms of the margins, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve specifically disclosed or provided margins but one of the benefits that we derive and one of the reasons that we implement at the commonly managed plans is our cost are better. These plans have been value engineered, they\u2019ve been should cost\u2019ed [ph], they\u2019ve been intentionally designed to live better to provide better livability to the consumer which we believe translates into higher sales prices and lower costs. So just directionally I would tell you we have better margins on those plans. Marshall Mentz : And I guess just as a quick follow up. What\u2019s the status on updates of active adult floor plans? Are those still in process or beginning to be rolled out? Ryan Marshall : If you\u2019re making the reference to the redesign of our commonly managed active adult portfolio, the progress on those is going well. We have a very detailed process that we follow in testing those. They are in the market being tested and being first built and those will rollout more broadly to new communities as they open into 2019. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Jack Micenko from SIG. Please go ahead. Soham Bhonsle : Hi. Good morning, guys. This is actually Soham on for Jack this morning. So over the last couple quarters you\u2019ve been growing absorptions. So wanted to get your thoughts on the intersection, if you will, between growing community count, managing pace? And then what that means for gross margins ultimately because clearly as you\u2019ve managed pace, you\u2019ve been able to sustain margins. But at the same time community count growth is more cash intensive way to grow the business. So just wondered to get your thoughts on where you\u2019re headed there? Ryan Marshall : Yes, there is a lot there. This is Ryan. I\u2019ll try and touch on a couple of pieces and then maybe the pieces that we missed you can come back with follow on. The first thing I would tell you is that we don\u2019t underwrite the margin. Our focus is on delivering the best return profile that we can for the business. Certainly margin and pace are two of the significant levers that play into that as well as the asset turns and how efficient we are with the asset. So it\u2019s managed on a community-by-community basis frankly. Sometimes it\u2019s margins, sometimes it\u2019s pace and it\u2019s really working to find what the optimal blend of that is. We think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of it right now. Our margins are sector leading, industry leading and we like where we\u2019re at. We\u2019re getting nice absorptions. We\u2019re getting good asset efficiency and it\u2019s translating into a nice return profile. I think we\u2019ve got the dials appropriately adjusted but we\u2019re constantly looking at it and making tweaks. Soham Bhonsle : Okay, great. And then just wondering to see if you guys have or are willing to share sort of an ROE target now that your contracted share buyback program is behind you and you\u2019re growing book value again? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: We candidly haven\u2019t done that historically and so I\u2019ll offer to say that we\u2019re not going to today. And largely because the return characteristics change over time depending on where you are in cycle and in investments and so our goal is to invest at high returns. And if we do that, we think we\u2019ll generate good returns on equity over time particularly of being a company that does have part of the capital allocation buying back stock. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Peter Galbo : Hi, guys. Good morning. It\u2019s actually Pete Galbo on for John. Thanks for taking the question. I think to an earlier question somebody had asked about option percentage for the total book moving up close to 50% over the next one or two years, is there anything structural that would prevent you from going materially higher than that longer term or is that just kind of a yardstick that you\u2019re putting out there for right now? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: It\u2019s Bob. I think the answer to that depends on how the sellers behave. We\u2019ve been pretty clear over time that when we\u2019re doing this, we\u2019re not putting money sources between us and land sellers. We\u2019re typically negotiating with the land seller. And so what we\u2019re really seeking to do is a, preserve capital efficiency and b, to try and mitigate market risk. And so our ability to do that is going to be predicated on sellers\u2019 willingness to do that. We haven\u2019t put a mandate out in front of the field that says, we want to make sure that you only have two years of owned supply in any one deal or that you have to have optionality and it\u2019s just that the economics makes sense. So with that having been said to Ryan\u2019s point, we\u2019ve done a pretty nice job getting up to almost 40%. We think we might get there by the end of the year. But it\u2019s directional as opposed to a target. Ryan Marshall : Pete, the other thing I\u2019d want to maybe just correct. We are directionally moving in the 50% direction. It will likely take longer than the next one to two years. So I think what Bob talked about is right. It depends on the seller. We don\u2019t \u2013 we like the benefits that we derive from having more option lots. They do come at a cost and we\u2019ve got to work that into our overall economics of land acquisition. Peter Galbo : Got it. That\u2019s helpful guys. And Ryan, maybe in some of your regional commentary if we could dig in a little bit more. Florida again this quarter was particularly strong, orders up around 40%. Is there any one price point there that\u2019s performing particularly well for you guys or is it really a function of your opening a lot of communities in that area, just any additional granularity to help us with that? Ryan Marshall : Yes, the more affordable price points are certainly performing well but we\u2019ve got a broader range of products throughout all of our Florida markets. We operate in nearly every major city within Florida and with that comes kind of a broad range of price points. I think our Florida team has done an outstanding job with strategy and land positioning, community positioning there. We\u2019ve got good execution. We operate all four of our brands there well. So I think it\u2019s kind of the full complement of what our company offers is contributed to our success in Florida. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Please go ahead. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask back on lot options, Ryan. As you\u2019re looking at your current mix and what you anticipate in the future, how do you think about the split between finished lots and raw lots? Would you intend to do more raw lots in general or are you seeing finished lots come back in any meaningful way or those of interest to you? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Carl, good question. We\u2019re seeing mostly raw, mostly self developed. There are a few developed lot positions out there. But as I think we and probably you\u2019ve heard from a lot of our competitors, the developer base really was decimated in the downturn and they have not come back in a meaningful way. So there\u2019s a few markets where there\u2019s a good developer base and I think when available \u2013 when they put finished lots on the ground and if they\u2019re available, we\u2019d certainly take them. But it goes through the same underwriting process that we do any other transaction. Carl Reichardt : Okay, it makes sense. And then on M&A, Ryan, ex-price and wanting to get something as inexpensively as possible, can you sort of sketch out your perspective on M&A now? What kind of a deal would be of interest to you if any would? Obviously there are investors saying, well, the ball\u2019s in Pulte\u2019s court now. What might they do? So I\u2019d just like to get your thoughts on that. Thanks so much. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Carl, M&A really falls into the \u2013 and it goes back to some of the things that Bob was talking about as it relates to capital and use of cash and share buybacks. When we articulate our capital allocation priorities, number one was to invest in our business and M&A falls into that category. So a deal that would make sense for us would be one that we think is consistent and in line with our overall land acquisition strategy. We don\u2019t believe that we need any other brands and we don\u2019t believe that we need anyone else\u2019s homebuilding platform. We think the one that we have is superior. So it would really be about if there is a land acquisition opportunity that was in the form of M&A. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim from UBS. Please go ahead. Dan Oppenheim : Thanks very much. Was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the entitlement process? You talked about the West [indiscernible] and such. Wondering how that is and sort of impacting the overall thoughts on community growth across regions here? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, this is something we\u2019ve been asked about for years. It\u2019s hard and getting harder I think is the right way to characterize this. You have to spend time. You got to work through the planning commission. You\u2019ve got to work with local residents. Especially if you think about where Pulte has been investing, we\u2019ve not worked out into the exurbs, so that secondary or tertiary. We\u2019ve tried to stay a little bit closer. So it\u2019s typically going to be higher density. It\u2019s going to be more infill or closer and I think the entitlements are there. Certainly on the Coast, it has been a challenge for years. I think the entitlement timelines are extending just about everywhere. Dan Oppenheim : Got it. And then in terms of the land and the timeline for getting to 50% optioned as Ryan commented about [indiscernible] longer into next one to two years. Presumably that means there is more potential for cash being used for repurchase the longer that timeline ends up being there? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: No. Essentially I would actually say it\u2019s the opposite. The more optionality we can build into our land pipeline, the less cash we have to invest in land which would free up capital for other purposes. So as an example if we cut our land spend in half because we did twice as much optionality, we have more cash available to invest obviously or to do other things with whether it was dividends or repurchases. Ryan Marshall : Right. And then as far as would we use that extra cash which I think was part of where your question was, would we use that extra cash to buy more shares? It really goes back to one of the answers that Bob gave several questions back. It\u2019s a committed priority of our capital allocation strategy. We\u2019re not providing any forward guidance other than to say it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to be a consistent re-purchaser of the equity. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Paul Przybylski : Thank you. This is actually Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. I guess earlier in the call, Ryan, you mentioned that local scale was most important for increased efficiency. What markets do you feel you get the biggest bang for your investment to increase your local scale? And is that how you have been deploying your capital of late? Ryan Marshall : Paul, I want to make sure I understand the question. Can you rephrase that? Paul Przybylski : Yes. You said local scale was the most important for driving increased efficiency. What markets out there do you think have the great opportunities for you to increase your local scale? And is that where you have been directing your capital? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Paul, it\u2019s a good question. What I would tell you is we seek to increase scale in all of our markets. And if we don\u2019t have scale, we\u2019ll leave. We highlighted St. Louis in particular in the Midwest that contributed some of our year-over-year decline or comp in comparison to prior year. So does it influence where we\u2019re making investments? Absolutely. But other economic factors in markets in particular are certainly a driver as well. Is the population growing, are there jobs there, how does that local market behave and how do we see the opportunity to deploy our brands and our strategy into those cities in particular. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Paul, the only thing I\u2019d add to that is a 100%. As part of our strategic planning every year, we sit down with our local operating teams and that is one of the things we cover. Do you have local market scale? And if you don\u2019t, how are you going to get it? What are the investment criteria we need to think about? How much capital do you need to do it? So to Ryan point, does it influence our capital allocation? Without question. Paul Przybylski : Okay. And then I guess to change topics here, looking forward and probably a rising rate environment, would there be any change to your pricing strategy at some point so as not to choke off demand but you take a more conservative outlook? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Paul, I think that\u2019s a day-by-day decision as we evaluate what the value is in the marketplace. And so affordability is always a factor. It\u2019s certainly getting more and more expensive to buy a home. But as we measure the supply and demand environment and each individual community, that\u2019s what drives those decisions not one specific data point of a rate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. Please go ahead. Jay McCanless : Hi. Good morning. My first question on the active adult absorptions being down versus last year, was a little surprised to hear that because that active adult empty nester cohort we continue to hear in the field that there\u2019s a lot of demand coming from that group. So maybe if you could talk about that cohort relative to what you guys are doing with Del Webb and some of your other products over maybe the next one or three years what you see or where you see Del Webb growing? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Jay, it\u2019s Bob. Certainly we noticed the fact that absorptions are down 3%. We\u2019ve looked at it. We don\u2019t see anything in particular whether it\u2019s part of the market, part of the geography. Paces were up 17% last year, so a challenging comp. We feel really good about the active adult buyer. Candidly we\u2019re looking for more ways to serve them whether it is through the active adult Del Webb brand, those our DiVosta brand in certain parts of the market and through our Pulte brand in other parts of the market. So the demographic pull is strong. The health of that consumer group is excellent. So really nothing to report other than we think we were up against a tough comp. Jay McCanless : The second question I had, could you talk about how many of the \u2013 because community count this quarter was a lot higher than we expected. Could you talk about what percentage of those new communities went to first-time buyers? And then also could you repeat what the guidance was for community count growth for the rest of the year? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, I\u2019ll answer the second one first. Our guidance 3% to 5% up each quarter compares to the prior year comparable quarter. And if you look at the growth year-over-year, we were up about 9% in first-time community count, 8% in move-up and 8% in active adult. So it\u2019s pretty consistent across the spectrum of the demographic groups. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Kenneth Zener : Good morning, gentlemen. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Ken. Kenneth Zener : Looking at the EBIT margins by segment that you guys report and just kind of taking \u2013 looking at it annually the last few years. Do you \u2013 so Florida, Texas, you\u2019ve got a 15 handle, the West you got an 11. Is there something as you look out next few years, not the corporate margins but at the segment level that would cause some mean reversion one direction or another between your segment profitability and specifically is there big gross margin, SG&A swings in those regions? Just trying to think about your collective mix, because Florida is doing so well in your margin, Texas is doing very well. Just wondering if we might see upside from the West or if compression in those other regions? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : It\u2019s an interesting question, it\u2019s also a hard one to answer because \u2013 and I know this is going to be a non-answer but mix matters. So what are we buying and what consumer group is it serving, because if you\u2019re buying finished lots, you\u2019re going to have lower contribution margin but it might be still excellent return. If you\u2019re buying raw, you might need a little bit more margin to make the return make sense. And how that feathers [ph] into the profile matters. So having said that, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any structural difference between different parts of the market right now. We would expect if we see contraction coming or if we see real opportunity. Clearly the pricing environment in California has been one that has been able to allow price appreciation but the land is expensive. I know that\u2019s not a real answer to your question but it really does matter how and when and what type of land you\u2019re buying. Kenneth Zener : That\u2019s fine. And I guess what is your total units underproduction at the end of 1Q? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Just under 10,000. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, so that\u2019s the 9,950 we gave during the call. Kenneth Zener : Okay. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions left in the queue. I will hand the conference back over to your host for any additional or closing remarks. James Zeumer : Great. I want to thank everybody for their time this morning and we\u2019re certainly available for any follow-up questions. And we\u2019ll look forward to speaking with you over the course of the day and on the next call. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good day and welcome to the PulteGroup's Q2 2018 Quarterly Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. Sir, please go ahead. James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Katie and good morning. I'm pleased to welcome all participants to PulteGroup's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President-Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of today's call to the website a little later. PulteGroup's second quarter earnings in both 2018 and 2017 included several unusual items which are noted in the earnings release. As part of the call, we will comment on our reported results as well as our financial results adjusted to exclude the impact of these items. We have provided a reconciliation of these adjusted numbers to our reported results in our earnings release and within the webcast slides posted as part of this morning's call. We encourage you to review this information to assist in your analysis of our Q2 results. Before I turn the call over to Ryan Marshall, let me remind everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks Jim and thank you to everyone joining us this morning's call. I am excited to discuss PulteGroup's outstanding second quarter results. As I know there are several earnings calls over the course of the day. Let me quickly summarize our Q2 results. On a year-over-year basis PulteGroup's homebuilding revenues increased 25%. Our adjusted gross margin increased by 60 basis points. Our adjusted operating margin increased by 180 basis points and, most impressive, our adjusted earnings per share increased by 89%. Our top line growth, operating gains and improved returns continue to benefit from solid execution of our established business practices. While these practices have been refined as the housing cycle has advanced, the core objectives have remained constant. First, we're investing in the business through high returning projects, in fact over the past four-and-a-half years we've invested over $5 billion in acquiring new land assets. Throughout this period the fundamentals of our disciplined underwriting practices have not changed. Our focus remains on achieving high returns on invested capital as we continue to emphasize investing in smaller, faster turning projects. Consistent with our focus on returns, we've also expanded our lots under option which are now up to 40% of our controlled lot position to enhance returns and mitigate risks. Second, we continue to realize efficiencies throughout our homebuilding operations. We are proud of the fact that we're routinely maintained among the highest gross margins and operating margins in the industry. This hasn't been achieved by chance, but by changing core business processes including the integration of extensive customer research into our product design and development. Our innovative new floor plans are then rolled out through our common plan management platform. I'd highlight that 80% of our Q2 closings were from commonly managed plans. Once in the field, we use the innovative pricing system that we built seven years ago to help maximize higher margin option and lot premiums revenues. Consistent with these practices we are finishing the market testing of our new active adult floor plans ahead of their national rollout early next year. I would also highlight that during our second quarter we launched our Pulte Smart Home. PulteGroup is the first builder to offer such smart home technology nationwide in every home that we build while allowing home buyers to select the technology components that best suit their needs. For some this means basic WiFi, while for others they want to control the entire home including heating and cooling, door locks, garage doors, entertainment and some, even their appliances. And third, we're allocating capital in alignment with the company's stated priorities which includes returning funds to our shareholders. Our earnings per share and return on equity have been enhanced by systematically returning excess capital to shareholders through dividends and our share repurchase program. Since 2013, we've returned approximately $3 billion to shareholders and have repurchased almost 30% of PulteGroup's common shares. Of course, all of these initiatives would have been just words on paper without the hard work and commitment of the industry's most talented team. I want to thank all of our employees who work hard every day to deliver the highest quality homes and an outstanding home buying and mortgage experience to our customers. The business practices we've pursued in combination with the tremendous efforts of our employees certainly contributed to the significant gains realized in the second quarter. The good news is that we see opportunities to get even better, as Bob will detail in a minute. Given the strength of our business, we are increasing our guidance on several key financial metrics. It would be unwise for us to take all of the credit for the strength of the operating and financial gains. We recognize the favorable macro conditions that continue to surround and support our industry. As you would expect, when market dynamics include sustained demand and limited supply, prices will typically increase. This has certainly been the situation in housing for a number of years and has only continued as builders seek to pass through higher labor and material costs. The ability to raise price is obviously positive, but affordability concerns are real, especially given mortgage rates which have been volatile. We continue to see increased traffic to our websites and to our communities, but the traffic to contract conversion rates eased a little during the quarter, particularly among first time and move-up buyers when mortgage rates rose in May. And while trends improved as the quarter progressed, buyers clearly want to see value in their purchase. This serves as a good reminder that affordability still matters. To summarize, we remain very positive on market conditions and the ongoing demand for new homes. The country continues to benefit from a strong jobs market, exceptionally low unemployment, modest wage increases, and high consumer confidence, all of which are positive for housing demand. At the same time, the supply of new and existing homes remains low and continues to run below estimated need. Within these operating conditions, our broad geographic presence, diversified product offering and strong operating platform has the company positioned well for ongoing success. Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of our outstanding Q2 results. Bob? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Thanks, Ryan and good morning. The company's Q2 results represent another quarter of material year-over-year increases and performance gains. As noted in our release, our second quarter results for 2018 and 2017 include several unusual items. As a result, I will discuss reported as well as adjusted numbers to provide a clear understanding of our underlying business performance. Starting with signups, we reported a total of 6,341 signups in the quarter which was comparable with last year. By buyer group, first time orders decreased 13% to 1,657 homes. Move-up orders declined by 2% to 2,906 homes and active adult orders increased 16% to 1,778 homes. Traffic to our communities remained high throughout the quarter. The lower signups among first time and move-up buyers reflect the modest slowdown in conversion rates that we experienced toward the middle of the quarter. As Ryan mentioned, we believe this may have been in response to the rise in mortgage interest rates. The strength within our active adult business, up 16%, demonstrates why we have always worked to maintain a strong presence among each of the primary buyer groups. Reported Q2 signups were also impacted by actions we took in certain markets and communities to effectively manage lot releases, sales pace, and pricing. While every community is different, at present we generally believe that maximizing price and margin over pace is the best way to deliver long term high returns. You can see the benefit of this strategy in the strength of our gross margins which are being realized while still growing our expected delivery volumes over last year. Given a 5% increase in community count in the second quarter, absorption pace was down approximately 6% compared with last year. Consistent with Ryan's comments on the strength of our Q2 financial results, we generated significant gains throughout our income statement. Starting at the top, our home sale revenues increased 25% to $2.5 billion. Our higher revenues for the quarter were driven by a 14% increase in closings to 5,741 homes along with a 10% or $37,000 increase in average sales price to $427. The $37,000 increase in our average sales price for the quarter reflects pricing gains across all buyer groups. For the second quarter, the average sales price for first time buyers increased 25% of the prior year to $360,000 while move-up gained 8% to $490,000, and active adult was up 3% to $389,000. We continued to experience pricing strength within our first time buyer communities, but the 25% increase in Q2 was influenced by closings out of California. As we've talked about on prior calls, we have California communities serving first time buyers often older millennials who are buying their first home with average sales prices well over $700,000. These are typically townhouse communities on community rail lines where the buyer is likely a software engineer or two working at one of the many tech companies in the area. Looking at our Q2 closings by buyer group they breakdown as follows, 30% first time, 46% move-up, and 24% active adult which is consistent with last year. In terms of our production universe, we ended the second quarter with 11,845 homes in backlog and 11,158 homes under construction. Of the homes under construction, 8,550 or 77% are sold units with the remaining 23% being spec production. Given this production pipeline, we expect third quarter deliveries to increase to between 6,000 and 6,300 homes which will represent an increase of 17% to 22% over last year and keep us on track to achieve our expected full year 2018 closings in the range of 22,500 to 23,500 homes. Given the price increases we've utilized in our signups, we now expect closings over the remaining two quarters to have an average sales price in the range of $415,000 to $425,000. This is an increase from our prior guidance of $405,000 to $420,000. Continuing down the income statement, our gross margin for the quarter was 24% which is up 60 basis points over the last year's adjusted gross margin of 23.4% and up 40 basis points sequentially from the first quarter of this year. Note that our prior year adjusted gross margin excludes the impact of the land-related and warranty charges taken in that period. Supported by our strategic pricing methodology, gross margins continue to benefit from higher option revenues and lot premiums. On a year-over-year basis, option revenues and lot premiums increased 5.5% or just over $4,000 to $79,429 per home. Attesting to the relative strength of the operating environment sales discounts in the quarter fell 30 basis points to 3.2% of average sales price or $14,000 per home. Given current market conditions, and consistent with our focus on delivering high returns on invested capital, we're finding opportunities to further extend our industry-leading gross margins. As a result, we're updating our guidance for the remainder of 2018 and now expect Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%, and Q4 gross margin to be in the range of 23.8% to 24.3%. This is up from our prior guide of 23% to 23.5% for both quarters. The sequential change in gross margin from Q3 to Q4 reflects the impact of higher lumber costs which are moving through the system. We also expect to change, on a relative basis, in the number of closings from certain higher margin communities in California, given current lot availability and our actions to better balance sales, production and lot development in support of support returns. Looking at our overheads, we also generated significantly better operating leverage in the quarter. Our reported SG&A expense of $226 million or 9.2% of home sale revenues includes the $38 million benefit associated with an insurance related reserve adjustment recorded in the period. Excluding this benefit, our adjusted SG&A for Q2 was $264 million or 10.8% of home sale revenues. Our current year performance represents an improvement of 120 basis points over our prior year. Given our results for the first half of 2018, we're reaffirming our guidance that we expect full year 2018 SG&A to be in the range of 10.8% to 11.3% of home sale revenues. This guidance excludes the impact of the insurance reserve adjustment recorded in this quarter. In the second quarter, we also generated net land sale gains of $27 million, primarily resulting from the sale of two land parcels neither of which was included in last year's actions on non-core assets. The decision to sell these positions reflects our focus on balancing land investments, returns and risks across our portfolio. For the quarter, our financial services business generated pre-tax income of $21 million which represents an increase of 9% over the second quarter of last year. The increase in pre-tax income for the quarter was primarily the result of higher volumes in our homebuilding operations. Our mortgage capture rate in the quarter was 76% which is down from 79% last year and which reflects the highly competitive market conditions that exist today. Our reported income tax expense for the second quarter was $85 million which represents an effective tax rate of 20.8%. Our tax rate for the quarter includes $17 million of net tax benefit related primarily to energy tax credits and accounting method change that was accepted by the IRS during the second quarter and changes in certain state tax laws. Excluding these items, the company's effective tax rate was approximately 25% which is consistent with our prior guidance. For the second quarter, PulteGroup's reported net income was $324 million or $1.12 per share compared with reported net income of $101 million or $0.32 per share last year. On an adjusted basis, our net income for the quarter was $259 million or $0.89 per share compared with adjusted net income of $148 million or $0.47 per share last year. On a per share basis, our adjusted 2018 results represent a significant 89% increase over our adjusted results last year. Q2 diluted earnings per share were calculated using approximately 287 million shares which is a decrease of 27 million shares or 9% from 2017. The decrease in share count is due primarily to the company's ongoing share repurchase activities. Switching over to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $402 million of cash. During the quarter, we used $53 million of cash to repurchase 1.7 million common shares at an average price of $30.07 per share. In total this year, we've repurchased 3.5 million shares for $105 million and have $489 million remaining on our repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 39.9%. This is down from 42% at the start of the year and is now within our target range of 30% to 40%. Based on normal operations, we expect our leverage ratio to continue trending lower through the remainder of 2018. As I mentioned earlier, we ended the second quarter with 11,158 homes under construction which represents an increase of 1,570 homes over last year. The increase reflects higher sold units under production as we continue to control specs, having fewer than 600 finished spec homes across our operations. For the quarter, our community count was up 5% over last year to 847. This increase is consistent with our guidance of 3% to 5% quarterly growth which we'll maintain for the third and fourth quarters of 2018. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $352 million in land acquisition and we approved an additional 6,900 lots to purchase of which approximately 57% were under some form of option. We continue to focus on acquiring communities that are smaller and with shorter durations as the average deal size, including several new Del Webb positions was about 120 lots per community. Through the first six months of 2018, the company invested $640 million in land acquisition and $650 million in land development. This keeps us on track to invest approximately $2.8 million in land acquisition and development in 2018 which is up 10% over last year. Given the company's improved profitability even with this significant land investment, we now expect to generate between $900 million and $1.1 billion of cash in 2018 before dividends and share repurchase activities. This is an increase of $200 million from our prior guidance. As Ryan mentioned, at the end of the quarter we controlled approximately 149,000 lots of which approximately 40% are controlled via option. Based on the trailing 12 month of our deliveries, we have successfully reduced our owned lot position down to 4 years as to make steady progress toward our long-term goal of owning three years or less. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan for some final comments on market conditions. Ryan? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Before we open up the call to questions, let me provide a few comments on the market conditions we experienced during the quarter. As I said earlier, the macro economic backdrop remains favorable as unemployment is low and consumer confidence is high which supports our continued positive view of the market. Looking at conditions across our regions, demand in our North-Eastern Florida markets remained strong in the quarter while our Southeast markets experienced more volatility. Overall, buyer interest and traffic levels remained high on the East Coast. Consistent with my earlier comments, we were pleased with demand in the middle third of the country as traffic and buyer interest generally remained solid in the Midwest and Texas. And finally, out West, we continue to see good demand in the markets although reported signups were down for the quarter. Lower signups reflect price versus pace decisions we made given lot constraints, land development delays and lengthening backlogs in certain markets. Through the first few weeks of July, we continue to see high levels of traffic to our website and in turn to our communities. In closing, the company has delivered exceptional financial results in the first two quarters of 2018. With the backlog approaching 12,000 homes valued at $5.2 billion in combination with strong gross margins, we're well positioned to report a full year of outstanding performance. Now, let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Great, thank you. We'll open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of the call. We ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Katie, if you explain the process, we'll get started. Operator : Our first question will come from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, I guess addressing probably the area of most interest across the investor base today, in regards to demand trends and the order results that you referred to by segment and also during the quarter. I was interested in terms of the comments you made that trends improved as the quarter progressed and that you saw a little bit of a slowdown in May which is interesting given that rates did move, but perhaps only 10 bps, 20 bps intra-quarter within that month. So I was curious if you could kind of give us a sense month by month what the order growth was during the quarter; April, May, June. And kind of bigger picture also, does this cause you to make any adjustments in terms of your land purchase activity if the demand can be this susceptible to such a small move in rates? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Mike, good morning. This is Ryan. Good question. What I would tell \u2013 I think I've answered the first part of your question which is we saw things get better as we moved throughout the quarter. As I mentioned May was the month where we saw a bit of softness. To the broader question, I think it really kind of goes to how do we see business overall, and at a national level, I'd tell you that the business is good and buyer traffic to our website, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, and more importantly into the communities remains high. So buyers are out. They're shopping and then that translates into sales. So that being said, the local conditions matter and we are seeing some variation in demand across certain markets and buyer groups. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate that, Ryan. And I guess just on my second question, first off, if there's any ability to be a little more specific in terms of month by month if June turned positive, for example, that would be I think of interest, but I guess the other part of the coin is you had mentioned that part of the decline or the slowdown in order growth was also due to kind of maybe choosing price and margin over pace. Given your margins being at solidly above industry averages and you even raised your margin guidance, are you at a point where you want to maybe drive the volume growth, the order growth, do you feel like we're at a point in the cycle now where just kind of moving the ship forward and obviously, given the increased lot position and continued strong land spend that the gross margins are sufficiently strong and you can kind of even just hold gross margins where they or throttle them back a little bit to ensure a steady volume growth going over the next couple of years? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Mike, there was a lot in that question, so let me see if I can touch on as many as parts of it as I can. Our strategy has remained very solid in that we're focused on driving the best returns that we possibly can for shareholders. And we do that by managing the pace and the price levers on a community by community basis. So we're very proud of our gross margins and this second quarter, I think, is a testament to the great work that we've done on both the sales price side as well as the cost side to create an environment where we do have the best margins in the business. Volume is certainly a part of that equation and we had a nice quarter in the number of sign-ups that have been generated that have contributed to a backlog that's approaching 12,000 units. So we're continuing to see favorable demand trends, we like what we're seeing in our sales offices and we're hearing from buyers. As I mentioned, value is something that's really important to buyers, affordability is important. As sales prices have gone up and mortgage rates have ticked up, I think it's the two things in concert that have contributed to a bit of the softness that we saw intra-quarter. We'll continue to address it on a community by community basis and rest assured that volume will continue to be part of the story for PulteGroup. As far as your question on planned land spend, we don't have any plan change in our land spend. We're executing well through six months of the year and we don't see anything changing throughout the balance which is reflective of our positive view of the market that I think both Bob and I touched on in our prepared remarks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Thanks very much, guys and congratulations on the results. Ryan, I wanted to follow-up on your most recent comment there about the decision to manage pace and price and all that. I was curious as to what kind of a difference you would need to see in the environment for you to shift the lever more towards volume than what you have seen thus far which has encouraged you to sort of keep the lever very much on the side of profitability and be willing to sustain a slightly negative order comparison this quarter. Could you just give us a sense for what would be different about the environment that you see that would cause you to shift that lever more noticeably to the volume side? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Stephen, good question. And it really does come down to a community by community basis for us in terms of how we pull the volume lever. We certainly pay attention to all the macro trends, consumer confidence, what kind of resale inventory is available, what kind of new home inventory is available. Those are all the things that I think play into the decisions that we'd ultimately make on volume. As we've long talked about, we're looking to drive the best possible returns that we can out of the business and when we look at what our lot availability is, what the size of our backlog is, what the pricing environment is, how we measure up demand conditions, all of those \u2013 the local market conditions overall, how a local economy is growing, all of those things play into the ultimate decisions that we make around volume. So, one of the things that I'd tell you is we've been steadfast in our volume guidance for the year at 22,500 to 23,500 units for the year. We took that up 500 units in the last quarter and, as you heard Bob say, we've reaffirmed that. So we're still performing very much in line with how we saw the business and we'll continue to look at overall market conditions and make those decisions on a community by community basis. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you for that. I appreciate it. I guess, I was wondering, you mentioned that out West you sustained lower orders but that also was due to the fact that you were seeing some lengthening backlogs and you sort of assessed the landscape out there and so you sort of deliberately lowered some of your volume and order taking. I was wondering if this was a process in your mind that \u2013 and if so, if you could give us a sense of how far into the process you are? And I am specifically thinking about probably your backlog cycle times that you felt like were lengthening to the point where you could probably bring those in a little bit and going slower on the orders, are they right-sized now? Are you at a right level of cycle time such that you can now start to be a little bit more aggressive out West or is this something that you think is going to take another quarter or maybe two. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Well, we like where our cycle times are Stephen. We're always going to \u2013 as a production builder, inventory turns are a big component of how we drive success, so we're always going to work to improve the cycle times of our, specifically our house inventory and more importantly our land inventory, it's part of the reason that we've driving to get our owned lots shorter which we're making great progress against. As far as California goes, it's really specific to a couple of areas in the West where it was timing of new community openings last year along with some new community openings this year, combined with what was a fairly large backlog of sold homes and so, in that pricing environment and the limited lot availability, a difficult entitlement environment, we've made the decision there to control paces in certain communities and maximize price. The other thing I'd add, not a huge driver but it's worth mentioning, consistent with our focus of staying closer to the city centers, we have built out of our positions in Fresno and Sacramento which contributed to last year's sales paces. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, all. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Hi, Ken. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I guess, if you could comment maybe also the order trends, obviously, in focus. We tend to look at order pace sequentially, so you guys were down 11% versus the normal down 3%. I get it. My question is what we're seeing in our A to Z (32:24) report where we look at existing sales inventory, we are seeing rising existing inventory. And since you just mentioned Sacramento, what we've seen is when existing inventory rises, it tends to have an impact on the new home sales. We do see that specifically in Sacramento, for example, could you comment if you're seeing a relationship within your markets where you see inventory rising, for example, I think Nashville was up 30% year-over-year now, but are you seeing that suppress your new sales at all in type of market dynamics? Thank you very much. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Ken, good morning and thanks for joining us this morning. There is a relationship there and we certainly acknowledge that. The key point there is resale inventory is still below normal. Normally it would be considered six months, in most markets there is a lot that are 2.5 to 3.5 months, so a slight tick up in that I don't think has a dramatic impact on the new home sales environment. If we saw inventory level start to go over six months in certain markets you'd certainly probably see a bigger impact. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates. Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Thank you. Good morning guys. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Hi, Ivy. Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Nice quarter. Maybe you can help provide some clarity on the fact that discounts actually decreased relative to, I guess, the year ago, I think you said 3.2% and the fact that you're seeing slower conversion or the first-time buyer and some maybe reaction to rising rates. So I guess what I want to understand is while discounts are declining, it sounds like you're not able to see as much conversion and maybe pricing power. So can you explain that better please? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Ivy. It's a pretty simple explanation that we're sticking to our discipline around pricing and we've got excellent locations, our communities are executed well which is a credit to the wonderful teams that we have in the field operating our businesses and we're still able to do drive some pricing power. And as I mentioned in one of the earlier questions, it's a big component of driving returns and we like what we're seeing out of the business today. We're going to continue to pay attention to what's going on in the broader economy and be sensitive to a number of the things that we've touched on as it relates to new home inventory, resale inventory, interest rates, overall affordability, et cetera. But right now, we really like the business that we have. It was an outstanding quarter for the company that we're proud of. We like what we're seeing with overall traffic demand, and we'll continue to make modifications on a community by community basis as we need to. The other thing that I point out is we don't have a ton of spec inventory which is by design. That's how we run our business. And so some of the places where I think you're seeing probably more incentives and more discounting, it's probably with those that have strategies that are more heavily dependent upon spec inventory. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, the one thing I'd add to that, sorry Ivy, the one thing I'd add to that is while it's down 30 basis points, the dollars are about the same, so it's really reflective of our ASP increasing, it's still about $14,000 a unit. Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Got it. So just in terms of understanding I recognize the asset that you have and you want to maximize the returns. The consumer, if you think about that consumer that's buying the first townhome, the older millennial $700,000 whoever it is, are you able to raise price to make that contract \u2013 execute that contract or you have to hold price? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: I'm not sure we understand your question. Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Are you seeing apples to apples stability in that segment of the market where there is more sensitivity around rates and affordability, are you able to take that same product maybe compared to where you were a year ago and actually raise prices on that $700,000 townhome. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. This is one where the mix matters. I mean, certainly, you can see our ASPs are up across all buyer segments so, yes, we have had pricing power. I think if you think of the prepared comments, we talked about the fact that we think affordability matters. So going forward if rates are rising that may be a little bit more challenging but we have seen the ability to increase prices and candidly it's reflected in our margins. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. I wanted to just first of all clarify on the ASP commentary. Bob, I think you said $415,000 to $425,000, but I think I heard you say for the last two quarters of the year, is that for the full year or for the last two quarters of the year, obviously the reason I'm asking because you had a very strong performance, sorry, in the 2Q, so just wanted to clarify. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, that's for the balance of the year, Nishu, not average for the year. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. So what would mix it down again, was there something that drove it quite strongly in the second quarter that's going to reverse kind of mix effect wise in the second half of the year. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. We had highlighted that California has a number of years of high price points that we talked about in the first quarter as it influenced, had a little bit less in the second quarter as the volume ramps up for the year and the same will be true of the back half of the year, it will be a smaller percentage of the total business. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And on SG&A, strong performance in 2Q, why not lower it for the year off of that strength, is there something like the ASC 606 increasing SG&A in the back half of the year or are you just \u2013 will the strong performance kind of lower you than the range? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: You know Nishu we've guided to the range that we expect to come in. We have focused a lot on SG&A, we've made a ton of progress year-over-year and continue to do that. I don't know that you'll ever necessarily see us be the lowest SG&A company because we do make some investments in things around quality and culture of the company that we think are important but we have gotten substantially more competitive with our SG&A leverage and we're very proud of that. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, the thing I'd add Nishu, is we actually, if you remember we had updated our guide at the end of the first quarter which was reflective of the increase in the volume guide that we had given. We haven't changed our volume guide and we've talked about that from here forward for all the things Ryan has talked about in terms of how and why we spend our SG&A, it's going to be a kind of a margin game in terms of incremental volume would drive better overhead leverage, we haven't projected higher volumes and therefore we're still comfortable with our range. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Truman Patterson - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Truman Patterson on for Stephen East. How are you guys doing? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Good. How are you? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Doing well, Truman. Truman Patterson - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good. Hey, just wanted to follow-up on the demand side of the world, especially any recent change in consumer behavior. Really on the pricing side, has pricing started to scare off any customers in any region or buyer segment? I'm really thinking orders fell for the first time buyer and move-up and they also fell in four of your regions, just trying to get your sense on really the pricing side of the world rather than the mortgage rate side. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Truman, what I would tell you and I mentioned a little bit in Mike's question, at a national level the business is good but local market conditions do matter. And the example that I'd give you is Texas is doing well as a state, but we saw Houston slow a little bit among first time buyers. The West is strong from a demand standpoint, but we did see demand in Southern California get a little bit soft, again with those first time buyers. The Midwest is okay, but demand in Minnesota seemed to decelerate a little bit as we moved through the quarter, and then kind of ending with the Southeast, demand there is holding up, but the higher price points were off a tad. So overall housing demand is okay, but the individual markets do matter. For us, we did see most of the softening in the lower price points with our first time buyers and I do think that is reflective of a combination of price and mortgage rates, I think both matter. So that particular segment has been strong as of late. Proportionate to the overall sales price, the increases in lumber packages have had a disproportionate impact on that particular price and so I think not just us but all builders have worked to pass that through to the consumer. And I think, it's safe to assume that it certainly has an impact on how they see value and what they can afford ultimately at the end of the day. Truman Patterson - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, thanks guys. And then I don't know if I heard this in your prepared remarks, did you guys actually give absorptions by buyer segment and then in June with that rebounding did you guys change up any incentives at all in the markets? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Well, absorptions by buyer group; first time down 19%, move-up down 5%, active adult up 5% which blends to the down 6% for the quarter. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Then incentives? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Incentives, we've not had any meaningful incentive programs. We've obviously seen in markets people have started talking about national sales. We're not there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Micenko from SIG. John Gregory Micenko - Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Hi. Good morning guys. Another demand related question, shocker. Can you give us sales pace maybe by region, particularly maybe in the Southeast, what was happening in some of the regions you saw the sort of some of the lower order numbers? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Jack, what I'd tell you about the Southeast, as I mentioned in the prior question, we did see a little bit of softness in the higher price points in the Southeast. But the biggest driver there for us, we've closed out of several of our original John Wieland communities that were acquired as part of that purchase which was anticipated and projected and we simply have not replaced those on a one-for-one basis, so some of what you see in our Southeast numbers is reflective of that. John Gregory Micenko - Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Okay. And then, the margin on the land sale, it's probably one of the better margins you've seen, I think, back into 2013 or 2014 at least, and it wasn't part of the \u2013 it didn't sound like it was part of the modernization effort from maybe a year ago. What was that and what product segment did you feel like you could sell into a better opportunity? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, so you've got a couple of different assets there, out West both of them. One was in a market that we're not actually building in today and so we had an asset that was buildable by us, but we didn't have a production team and so we elected to sell it, and so there was real value embedded in that. The second was from a community that we had purchased recently actually and really we were trying to balance our appetite for risk in that particular market, so we sold off one of the product series as part of that as a means to just de-risk the transaction somewhat. And again, in California you've seen price appreciation where you can generate some significant value. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Hey, Carl. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : I won't ask about demand, I'll ask about margins for a second. Given the guide for Q4 relative to Q3 sort of that anti-seasonal decline, you talked about lumber, Ryan, can you talk at all about other materials, specifically ones that might be impacted by tariffs beyond lumber tariffs or anything related to labor cost that might be impacting that number or that you might be controlling particularly well and any change there in availability or cost of labor that's meaningful? Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Carl, you've got Bob here. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : Hey, Bob. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Certainly, the cost environment is one we're paying a lot of attention to. Our purchasing teams do a really good job of trying to do two things; one, buy as efficiently as possible and then to try and protect our pricing. We highlighted that lumber will influence our sequential margins because the pricing increases that we saw and exceedingly high prices that we saw until recently will come into our Q4 production pipeline because of the way we buy lumber. In terms of the labor market, no real changes there, again I think we do a nice job of making sure we've got multiple trades and multiple sources for most of our things so that we can at least work to try and minimize any pricing pressures there. With respect to tariffs, I guess what I would point to is in terms of what would impact us, steel obviously is something that is a contributor to our cost base, it's not obviously the biggest and that one we'll probably feel some but on the appliance side we've got long-term contracts that we think protect us from much of that pricing impact. Cabinets is another one with Chinese production. What we're seeing is some of the producers are already starting to source that from other parts of the world. So we don't think that will have a meaningful impact on us over time. And it's interesting, if you think about what's happened in the lumber market, we had the 20% tariffs last year, that's already reflected in the pricing. And I guess, on a relative basis, the good news is we came into the year saying, hey, with think that lumber pricing will turn down on the normal seasonal pattern and it didn't, but it finally did. So we're starting to see some relief there. That won't influence our production until next year, but again on a relative basis, could provide us some tailwind in 2019. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : Okay, thanks for that detail, Bob. And then I just want to ask about California and there's a lot of moving parts there. Can you give me a sense sort of, say, over the course of the next year or so, how will mix change geographically? It sounds like Sacramento, Fresno kind of come out but from a price point/buyer segment plus location, inland versus coastal, I mean I'm just trying to get a sense of whether or not that mix of communities is going to change a lot over the course of the next year, if you could just help me a little bit with that, I would appreciate it. Thanks. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Carl, I think you'll see our mix in California as we move from current mix to next year that mix is going to stay relatively stable. I'll start with our Northern California business. We have moved that business predominantly coastal, near the jobs. I mentioned Fresno and Sacramento we've moved out of. We did have sales there last year, so going forward that business is predominantly going to be a coastal business. In Southern California where about a 30% coastal, 70% Inland Empire business, I'd expect that to remain relatively stable as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start out on a couple of additional demand questions asked a slightly different way. One thing I'm curious about, you cited the option premiums, lot premiums in the quarter on deliveries. As you're getting through the process with buyers who are under contract getting closer to close, is there anything you can give us as far as whether you're getting any forward looking sense on if this affordability issue is starting to create some deceleration and what buyers are choosing in terms of option packages and also on the mortgage side, are you seeing any discernible shift towards ARMs? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Mike, I'll start with your first question. I'll let Bob handle the mortgage question. The only thing that I'd probably point to with buyers as they become pinched on price, they'll typically take a slightly smaller footprint. We have not seen them necessarily take fewer options in the home. I still think that they want the things that they want. They're working to find ways to afford those things. Potentially they take a lower lot premium. They don't take the water view. They may take something that's got a lower price tag from a lot premium standpoint. So as Bob detailed in his commentary, we actually saw increases in both things quarter-over-quarter, so we haven't seen a deceleration in the increases on those items. And I'll let Bob handle the arm comment or question. Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah. Essentially, we have not seen a substantive change in that. And I think it's because we've got a perceived rising rate environment. People are not typically going to do that unless they just can't afford not to. They need to get the cheaper rate, but in the most recent quarter, 6% of our volume, the mortgages that we originated were ARMs for comparison that was 5.7% in the second quarter of last year. What we have seen though is people are locking a little bit earlier, so we've seen our rate locks at 60 and 75 days increase as a relative proportion of the number of mortgages we're doing, so people are paying attention to rate for sure. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And Ryan, I guess, I was referring to hopefully some color on just not the closings that occurred in the quarter, but what the backlog or how the backlog is shaping up as it relates to the option packages and premiums going forward, but the second question. Oh, sorry go on. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Mike, I'll let you ask the second question, but we haven't seen a change in there. And as far as kind of our margin profile that's holding steady which I think is part of the reason that you saw us take our guide up for the back half of the year which would, I think, be the best indicator to say, no, we're not seeing a change. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: And go ahead with the second question. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Second question was really specifically around Texas because you've covered all of the country in terms of some of your commentary, but curious there was some deceleration in Texas. Could you walk us through the footprint a little bit more and kind of broken out by major markets, what you're seeing there if there is any real variation? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, the one that I would highlight is Houston, Mike. The other three markets that we operate in, I think, performed according to our expectations. Houston is the one that I think we've seen some change there. The only thing that I can really point to is that it's a city that went through one of the worst floods and hurricanes that the city and that country has seen in probably a hundred years. I think it's creating some prolonged entitlement and development timelines for new communities. I think the city is still kind of wrestling and working through some of the damaged homes and the impact that that has on overall supply. The economy there is healthy. It's a healthy economy. So beyond kind of the legacy impacts of the storm, I'm not sure that I can point to any reason why we would have seen softness there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Hi, Susan. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: The first thing I wanted to dig a little bit into is the comments around the traffic to your website. I guess, leading to May, was there anything that changed that would have sort of indicated that buyers were pulling back a bit. And then along with that you commented that it's been strong, but is there anything in terms of the amount of time they're spending on the site or the number of visits or what they're looking for? Any kind of nuances within that that you can share with us? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: No, Susan, nothing that we found to be meaningful to be a predictor, an indicator of current or future demand. Traffic has been strong. The year-over-year increases are up. So we're driving more traffic to the website today than we were a year ago, so overall positive. We're seeing that same trend continue with the conversion of traffic units to the website that's translating into increased traffic into the sales offices and those are some of the things that we pay particularly close attention to is to see what that conversion rate is from the time folks spend on the website and how that translates into foot traffic. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, thank you. And then, you commented that your new active adult plans you're currently testing those and that's continuing to move along. But I guess is there anything there, as we think about the need to drive value just broadly and especially maybe with the first time or the entry level kind of buyer that you can eventually take from your active adult communities and maybe roll out to other parts of your business? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Well, not really. Those floor plans \u2013 at a broad level I'd say that those floor plans are specifically designed with that buyer in mind. We have similar types of efforts though under our commonly managed platform where we're doing the same consumer research for our entry level buyers, for our move-up buyers. It's just the significance of highlighting the new active adult floor plans. That was the first buyer group that we designed consumer inspired commonly managed plans for and we stated all the way back when we started the program that we would create obsolescence, if you will, and every four to five years come out with the next generation of plans and that's what you're seeing with our active adult plans right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Rygiel from B. Riley FBR. Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Thank you. I just wanted to confirm, your order activity for first time buyers was soft. Did this buyer group rebound in June like the rest of the business? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Alex, as I said, we saw overall improvement in the business. Isolated into one buyer group, we haven't given that commentary, but we did see June better than May, still not great and we've seen July improve again, but probably still a little short of where we would have normally expected it to be. Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Okay. And you discussed Pulte holding pricing? Are you seeing any of your competition that is not holding pricing at this time? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Well, one of the questions that I answered earlier where we're seeing folks not hold pricing are the builders that have more inventory on the ground. It's expensive to hold inventory. You've got a lot of capital tied up into it. There's a lot of ancillary expenses associated with finished inventory, so that's where the discounts have traditionally gone and that's what we're seeing. We are seeing a few competitors start to do some national sales which I think is indicative of too much inventory and they need to move it. We're not in that position by design. It's not the way that we've chosen to run our business and so it's one of the things that allows us to hold our pricing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning. A quick question on the land spend. I think you guys are targeting up 10% for the full year. Should we read that as some sort of \u2013 would that be a reasonable proxy for how you think about community count for 2019? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, Buck, it's a little early to be talking about community count for 2019. We'll provide guidance on that and, broadly, I think the answer to that is no. You can't read into that because option versus raw, finished. There is a lot of things that factor into that and we'll give you some color on that in the fourth quarter. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And with the raised cash flow expectations for the full year, what's your first priority for where that incremental $200 million is going to this year? Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.: Yeah, it's a great question. I think, I'd point you back to the capital allocation that we laid out in 2014. First and foremost, if we feel good about the business, we're going to invest in the business. We want to pay our dividend. We would then use excess capital to buyback stock. The one thing I might add to that now is in a rising interest rate environment we might look at our debt if we thought that that was an attractive investment. And so the one thing I can promise is we'll be thoughtful about how we use that money. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer for closing remarks. James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.: Great. Thank you. I appreciate everybody's time this morning. We'll certainly be available over the remainder of the day if you have any follow-up questions, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

John Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to the PulteGroup's Q3 2018 Quarterly Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead, sir. James Zeumer : Great. Thank you, David, and good morning. I apologize if there's been some confusion on the dial-in numbers but hopefully we've got everybody in. I'm pleased to welcome you to today's call, which is to review PulteGroup's third quarter earnings. I'm joined on the call this morning by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post a copy of today -- a replay of today's call to our website a little later on. Before I turn the call over to Ryan Marshall, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss PulteGroup's strong third quarter results and the operating and financial gains we continue to realize. Given a quarter in which our revenues grew by 25%, our operating margin gained 190 basis points and our earnings per share increased 74%. I would typically focus my opening comments on the strength of our Q3 numbers. But when housing stocks drop over 20% during that same period, it may be more useful to start with the review of market conditions as this seems to be an area of focus for our investors. Based on industry dynamics, we maintain our positive view on the housing market and the overall sustainability of the current housing recovery. We fully appreciate, however, that operating conditions have changed over the past several months. We continue to actively assess the impact of rising interest rates and are making adjustments on a community-by-community basis to manage pace and price to achieve appropriate returns. That being said, let me provide a few high-level data points to consider, as it may provide some additional insight on what's happening in the market. Buyer traffic into our communities in Q3 was up 15% over last year, and the year-over-year gains accelerated as we moved through the quarter. To us, the increasing volume of consumer traffic indicates that homebuying interest remains high. While traffic into our communities was up in the quarter, company-wide absorption pace was down. These data points, along with the feedback from our sales teams, suggest that affordability may be becoming a bigger hurdle for potential buyers to overcome. For some buyers the problem may be an inability to qualify for a mortgage. For other buyers the bigger difficulty may be wondering if now is still a good time to buy or even questioning the perceived value of a new home, especially if the purchase requires giving up an exceptionally low mortgage rate they locked in a few years ago. Whether the hurdles are real or perceived the resulting impact was that the conversion rate of prospect to contract signing was down in Q3. We had talked about this lower conversion rate on our last earnings call and how it started to slow when mortgage rates begin ticking up in May. It certainly isn't new news that home prices have been marching higher, almost since this recovery started in 2011 and even accelerated in response to rising costs over the past year. Now layering on top of elevated home prices is a rise in mortgage rates, which are up roughly 50 basis points over the past six months. This combination of high income -- high home prices and more expensive financing has created a bit of sticker shock, while making it harder for some buyers to achieve their desired monthly payment. Market conditions may be more competitive but the key underpinnings of the business remain positive. Supporting the demand side is GDP growth, exceeding 3%, low unemployment, high consumer confidence and wage growth. We also believe that the industry continues to under build relative to demand. This is helping keep supply in check as evidenced by the fact that there's less than four months of inventory of new and existing homes on the market. Looking at today's overall market dynamics, we see an environment where housing can continue along the gradual growth trajectory it's been on for the past seven years. Buyer interest remains high, inventories remain low with land and labor constraints helping to reduce the risk of overbuilding. Higher rates and affordability concerns may be issues, but some combination of adjustments in price and/or income or simply even just the passage of time should help consumers to get over these hurdles. In what we view as a good operating environment, but one that is arguably more challenging than 6 to 9 months ago, we are well positioned to deliver ongoing financial success. Our gross and operating margins remain among the highest in the industry, as we continue to run a highly profitable homebuilding operation, which is critical in any operating environment. We grow increasingly efficient with our land pipeline, as we shorten its duration, increase option usage and remain fundamentally disciplined in the level of land investment we are making. And we continue to execute against our return base strategies with a focus on delivering through cycle performance. I think you see elements of these industry and company dynamics in PulteGroup's third quarter results. We delivered strong financial performance as we grew revenues by 25%, expanded operating margins by 190 basis points to 14.2% and increased earnings per share by 74% to $1.01 per share, all while generating high returns on invested capital. At the same time, however, we realized a slower conversion of high traffic volumes as consumers continue to adjust to current market conditions. And consistent with our stated capital allocation strategies, we returned $93 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to more than $250 million. As I said, and our Q3 results clearly demonstrate, PulteGroup is staying disciplined in the execution of our strategic initiatives and remains well positioned to operate in today's evolving housing market. Now let me turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. PulteGroup reported another strong quarter with meaningful performance gains realized in key operating and financial metrics. For the quarter, our net signups totaled 5,350 homes, which is up 1% over last year. Signup trends by buyer group in the third quarter were similar to what we experienced in Q2 of this year, as first-time orders declined 13% from last year to 1,373 homes, while move-up orders were down 1% to 2,456 homes. Demand among active adult buyers remained exceptionally strong in the third quarter as orders increased 22% over 2017 to 1,521 homes. Looking at our orders in a little more detail. First-time signups within our Southeast area were down in the quarter, most notably in our Charlotte, Raleigh and Coastal markets, which were impacted by Hurricane Florence. We also recorded fewer signups in our west area where, similar to Q2, the decline related primarily to Northern California, where we're experiencing softer demand for our first-time, albeit, higher priced homes. As Ryan highlighted, traffic to our communities was strong throughout the quarter and was up 15% over last year. Based solely on this metric, I think it's reasonable to say that buyer interest remains high. With traffic in our stores, we believe it's a matter of effectively responding to buyer concerns, real and perceived, to generate stronger sales in future periods. Given our focus on returns and through cycle performance, we're moving purposely but intently in adjusting community positioning to evolving market conditions as needed. Looking at our absorption paces, our Q3 absorptions were down 7% compared with the third quarter of last year, which is consistent with our experience for the second quarter of this year. By buyer group, absorption pace among first-time buyers was down 21%, which reflects the impact of slower sales pace, as I referenced in our Southeast and Northern California markets. While pace decreased 7% among move-up buyers and increased 9% among active adult buyers. Moving on to our income statement. We generated strong top line growth as homebuilding revenues increased 25% over last year to $2.6 billion. The higher revenues were -- for Q3 were driven by a 17% increase in closings to 6,031 homes in combination with a 7% or $27,000 increase in average sales price, $427,000. The year-over-year increase in Q3 average sales price was the result of price increases across all buyer groups. For the quarter, our average sales price among first-time buyers increased 25% over last year to $366,000. ASPs among move-up buyers increased 3% to $477,000 and active adult prices increased 2% to $398,000. The 25% increase in prices for first-time buyer communities is consistent with the pricing increase we noted in Q2, and reflects a mix shift that includes more California closings. Closings by buyer group in the quarter included 27% first-time, 47% move-up and 26% active adult, which is consistent with last year. At the end of Q3, we had a total of 11,202 homes under construction of which 8,286 homes or 74% were sold units and 2,916 or 26% were spec. Within our spec production, only 532 of the homes were finished. Given the composition of our production pipeline, we expect fourth quarter deliveries to be in the range of 6,500 to 6,800 homes, which would put us within our guidance for full year closings of 22,500 to 23,500 homes. Based on our backlog and current production schedule, we expect our Q4 average sales price to be in the range of $420,000 to $430,000. This is a slight adjustment from our prior guidance of $415,000 to $425,000. For the quarter, the company's gross margin was 24%, which is up 10 basis points over last year, as our operations continue to perform at a very high level. Reflective of the strong selling conditions in the first half of 2018, our Q3 gross margin benefited from higher option revenues and lot premiums, which increased 7.7% or approximately $6,000 over last year to just over $82,000 per home. It's also worth noting that sales discounts in the third quarter decreased 10 basis points to 3% of average sales price or $13,000 per home. Given that overall market conditions have gotten more competitive, we expect Q4 gross margin will likely come in towards the lower end of our previous guidance range of 23.8% to 24.3%. Reflecting our ongoing efforts to run a more efficient business, our third quarter SG&A expense was $253 million or 9.8% of home sale revenues. This compares with prior year SG&A expenses of $237 million or 11.6% of home sale revenues. Based on our expected closings and revenues for the fourth quarter, we expect our fourth quarter SG&A to be in the range of 9.5% to 10% of home sale revenues. Continuing down the income statement. Our financial services business has generated pretax income of $20 million, which is up 10% over last year's third quarter. For the quarter, we generated higher mortgage originations resulting from the increased closings in our homebuilding operations. It's worth noting that our mortgage operations experienced decrease in Q3 capture rate from 80% to 75% as well as compressed margins on loan originations due to the highly competitive conditions that continue in the mortgage market. Looking at our taxes. We recorded $95 million of income tax expense for the quarter, which represents an effective tax rate of 24.7%. In total, our net income for the quarter was $290 million, which represents a 63% increase over prior year net income of $178 million. More impressively, our earnings increased 74% on a per share basis from $0.58 per share to $1.01 per share. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was calculated using approximately 285 million shares, which is a decrease of 16 million shares or 5% from Q3 of last year. The lower share count is due primarily to our ongoing share repurchase activities, pursuant to which we repurchased 2.4 million common shares for $67 million or an average cost of $28.14 per share in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with $759 million in cash and a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9%. As previously discussed, strong earnings are working to quickly lower our leverage, taking us closer to the midpoint of our target debt-to-capital range of 30% to 40%. I'll finish my prepared comments with a few data points related to our homebuilding operations. Community count for the third quarter was 843, which is up 8% over last year. This increase above our guidance of 3% to 5% quarterly growth reflects the slower close out of certain communities rather than acceleration in new community openings. During the quarter, we invested $254 million in land acquisition and approved an additional 6,500 lots for purchase. Of the lots approved in the quarter, approximately 43% were under some form of option. Our year-to-date land acquisition spend of approximately $900 million is in line with our planned 10% increase, although our year-to-date land development spend is running a little behind our projected 10% increase. We ended the third quarter with approximately 150,000 lots under control of which approximately 41% are controlled via option. Based on the trailing 12 months of closings, we've reduced our owned lot position to less than 3.9 years and continue making steady progress toward our long-term goal of owning three years of land or less. Shortening the duration of the owned portion of our land pipeline is supportive of our efforts to improve asset terms and overall returns on invested capital. At the same time, the increase in option lots allows us to ensure future lot supply while reducing market risks. We see our disciplined, measured and lower risk approach to land investment being consistent with our focus on delivering better through-cycle performance, especially given the changing market conditions that appear to be developing. And finally, we now expect to generate between $1 billion and $1.2 billion of cash flow in 2018, which reflects our continued strong operating performance. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan for a few final comments. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. While I have already provided an overview of market conditions, I will offer a few comments on how the regions performed during the quarter. Along the eastern 1/3 of the country, we realized strong results in our Northeast and Florida operations, while our Southeast markets were more challenged, driven in some part by Hurricane Florence. In the middle 1/3 of the country, generally strong sales across our Texas markets helped to offset some softness we experienced in the Midwest. And in our Western markets, strong sales in our Arizona and Southern California markets were generally offset by slower demand in our Northern California and Seattle operations. Demand conditions through the first few weeks of October are consistent with trends that we saw in Q3 as high levels of traffic demonstrate ongoing buyer interest, but with consumers taking longer to make their purchase decision. In closing, I want to thank all of our employees who work hard every day to provide an outstanding home and buying experience to our customers. It's only through your efforts that we achieve the exceptional operating and financial results that we continue to deliver. Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Ryan. We'll now open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. [Operator Instructions]. David, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started with Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner : So I guess the -- if I look at your results this quarter, pretty similar to 2Q. Order growth pretty much right in line with what you did last quarter, margins flat. Ryan, your tone I think is more -- comes across as more cautious now versus what it was in July. And I know back then you still felt like there was some pricing power in the market you pointed to, incentives that were actually moving lower. And I know on a closings basis they were lower again this quarter. So -- yes, can you just help square a little bit? When I look at the result everything seems to be fairly status quo over the last six months or so but it sounds like you've seen a shift in the market. So are you starting to see other builders discounting more? Has that pricing power you mentioned last quarter eroded? Or are you taking a more aggressive stance on discounting, which might have some implications on margins into '19? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. And I'll do my -- there's a lot there so I'll do my best to touch on all those points. Let me, maybe, just start first and foremost with our view of the market, and I'll echo some of the things that I had in my prepared remarks which is, we still believe in the fundamentals of this housing recovery. We've got good GDP growth, interest rates are still historically low, acknowledging that they're moving upward, which is creating some challenges in affordability. That combined with overall asset values that have increased fairly rapidly over the last 12 to 18 months I think is part of what's created some of the slowness or the hesitancy on behalf of the buyers to transact. We still believe that we're underbuilding relative to what the need is there. On a single-family start basis, I would characterize normal as somewhere in the $1 million start range and we're at about $850,000, so call it 20% below where normal is. So we still believe that this market has got room to expand and room to run. Inventory levels are still below six months, which I think all would likely agree is considered normal. We're right around four months on the resale side and less than that on the new home side.  So the market has gotten more competitive there's no question about that. We are seeing additional incentives out there in the marketplace. I would characterize the incentives that we're seeing as normal. I haven't seen anything that I would put in the category of being irresponsible to this point. To that end, and we talked about it on our Q2 call, our local management teams on a community-by-community basis are empowered to make the decisions that need to be made to ensure that we're balancing the price and the pace equation. And I think you're seeing that come through in our results. So that's -- I'll take a breath there and then let you maybe come back with a follow-up if anything I haven't touched on. Alan Ratner : Yes. No, I appreciate that Ryan. So I guess just kind of parsing through that. When we look at your orders which have been kind of flattish last couple of quarters and just reading between the lines in terms of kind of empowering the local operators to make those decisions, is that the way you're kind of running the business right now that you want to maintain a fairly steady volume throughput, and obviously, the demand environment will dictate what you do on the pricing side to kind of generate that or am I interpreting that wrong? Ryan Marshall : Yes, I would probably characterize it just slightly different. Growth is an important part of our overall story, and we're -- we've acknowledged the last couple of quarters have been a little bit more challenging and we've seen flattish type growth. And I think that's reflective of the current operating environment. Buyer interest remains high. So I think that's a positive, it's not like the buyers have disappeared from the shopping environment. But it's been a more difficult environment. We're not going to overreact by giving away all of the margin that we've worked so hard to earn, but we're going to make the decisions that we need to make to make sure that we're continuing to turn the inventory. Being a production builder, I think you can appreciate how important that is to the overall equation of driving returns. I think we've made those appropriate decisions, and we've made the appropriate tradeoffs. But keeping up with market growth is an important part of what our overall story is. I think you saw our gross margins in Q3 come in near the lower end of our guide, and that's reflective of the fact that we did put some additional incentives in place to help move order growth. Alan Ratner : Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. And then just on the margin front, given the softer demand, what are you guys seeing on the cost side right now? Obviously, lumber is in the news, but I would imagine this time of year you're starting to have some conversations with your suppliers, with your subcontractors. Is that a push point where there could be any relief if the demand side remains a little bit sluggish over the next few months? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Alan, it's Bob. Candidly, we're always having those conversations with our suppliers and our trades. It's not necessarily just the year-end push. We haven't provided a guide for next year and we'll certainly do that when we release our fourth quarter earnings. I would characterize what we're experiencing today, a continuation of the theme. We've talked about that we saw a little bit of price increase -- cost increase this year, primarily labor. Obviously, lumber, everybody knows about. So one of the reasons we moved our guide down on margin in Q4 was that's when we'll feel the real brunt of that push-up in pricing early in the year. Obviously, that will provide some tailwind next year if pricing of lumber stays down where it is today relative to this year. But on a more broad basis, the commodity side of the business still feels pretty good. But labor, we're still paying for it, especially in markets where there's a lot of activity. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Kenneth Zener : I just want to ask, because I think you guys have been very sober about the cycle and how you guys want to be very measured in contrast to some other builders. So given that the decline -- easing demand wasn't really expected. I have kind of a large question, which is that, our view is that inventory is not necessarily tight because there's been high existing sales in many markets. And now with Western markets, a variety of markets showing rising inventory levels and falling sales. What would potentially be the implications for your business if inventory is not as tight as we -- as the nominal number suggests. And how would you kind of adjust FY '19 land spend if you could to kind of be reflecting the fact there is actually rising inventory, therefore, further slowdown in demand? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Ken, I think there's a lot of hypotheticals in the question. And so in an effort to maybe avoid kind of speculation I'm going to go with the numbers that we see out there and the numbers that we see would suggest that inventory is tight. If we were to be in an environment where inventory was to increase, I think simple supply-side economics would take over. And it would require us to make an adjustment to the volume of product that we're producing as well as pricing, would I think be the typical reaction that the market would expect. Kenneth Zener : Okay. And I understand your desire to stay focused. And then on the order pace, we look at it sequentially. And it looked like you guys actually did -- so you had a little more community count. But the pace was kind of still down 16% sequentially, which was in line with the long-term average. Is that to suggest that there's rising pressure on gross margins as we look to FY '19? I'm just trying to understand the comments about easing demand but normal seasonality in the orders. It seems a little -- I'm just trying to understand how you could have a normal seasonality yet the concern around demand if there's not a lot of pace price pressure building? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Ken, we haven't given a guide for margins for '19. We're in the middle of our planning process right now. So it would be premature for us to put that out there. We'll -- again, we'll give color on that when we release our fourth quarter earnings. I think if you think about what's happened though, we've affirmed the Q4 guide that we have, obviously, that's a lot of backlog. So I think your question is one that the sales environment will dictate ultimately. So you heard Ryan say, in this quarter we took some actions that did impact our margins slightly. So clearly, the environment matters. But for the term that we've given guide, we still feel comfortable with the range that we have provided last quarter and will update you on '19 next year. Operator : Our next question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of America. John Lovallo : The first one is you talked about adjusting community count positioning to meet the current kind of affordability challenges. Other than potentially discounting, what are some of the other things that you can do? I mean, can you actually reposition product within these communities? Ryan Marshall : Yes, John. It takes a little bit longer to move product. So in this current market environment, I -- you shouldn't see us make major changes to product offering. It just takes longer to work through municipalities typically. We do feel like we've got good offerings in the product portfolio that we have that allows consumers to make changes either in the structural options that they add to the home or maybe don't add to the home. They also have the ability to move up and down within the square footage range that we build within that community. So I think we're pretty well positioned there. As far as things that we can do, there are clearly incentives that we can offer as it relates to option packages, lot premiums. There's financing incentives that we can offer to help alleviate some of the pressure that we're feeling around overall affordability. And then, of course, the easiest thing potentially to do and sometimes the most painful from a profitability standpoint is just absolute base price adjustments, and we tend to go there last, is kind of the order of magnitude of change that we would typically make. John Lovallo : Okay. That's helpful. And then, the 3Q inventory looks like it was actually a bit of a cash inflow in what's typically a quarter with significant cash used. I mean, is this really just timing related? Is it greater mix of options? What's kind of the rationale there? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. I wouldn't say that there's anything unusual happening. Certainly, the increased desire and implementation of a higher optionality does have benefit as we're expanding the portfolio percentage of option. Certainly, we have less of a current need for cash to spend on dirt that would sit on the balance sheet. But I wouldn't look into it that much. If you think about it, the land just versus prior year is about flat despite us having more lots under control today than we did a year ago. But our house inventory is up about 12% to just under $1.4 billion, and that's reflective of just the number of houses we have in production. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : I wanted to ask you a question about incentives in the marketplace. I guess, in particular, by product type perhaps, how you've broken out first time, move up and that kind of thing. I'm wondering in general, when you look at the marketplace, the incentives you're seeing, are you seeing a little bit more or less at the lower end. And then with respect to that, some of your competitors have moved to a more standardized type of offering, particularly for the affordable product. And I was wondering if that -- if you're seeing that, result in them having fewer levers to pull. You just articulated a whole bunch of things you can do to avoid actually reducing the ASP, and you talked about options and stuff like that, that you can give away. If your -- some of your competitors have a much more standardized product, where I would think it'd be more difficult to make that change on the fly. So I was curious, if you are actually seeing people move to levers like ASP reduction more quickly this time than maybe in the past? Ryan Marshall : Stephen, it's Ryan. I'll answer your second question first, as it relates to the product that is more standardized, if you will, less optionality, less choice. Yes, I think your answer there is if you've got to make adjustments to increase pace, it's going to be price. And it may be one of the levers that you have is financing or financing-type incentives. I suppose you could maybe do something with landscaping packages or things like that, that may not be standard so you could add in some enhancements that might entice a buyer. Those communities and that style of operating are typically in the secondary ring and some of the tertiary markets that we don't necessarily compete in today. So -- but that's my assessment of how the market's playing out. In terms of incentives that are out there by consumer group, I think it really comes down, Steven, to a market-by-market situation based on the specific geography or specific ZIP Code that you're competing in. And so to paint a particular consumer group with a broad brush across the entire country. I'm going to probably refrain from doing because I don't know that the information I'd give you would be accurate. Stephen Kim : Okay. That's very helpful. So maybe geography is more important than consumer group. Ryan Marshall : Correct. Stephen Kim : Yes. In your opening remarks, I think, Ryan, you made a comment that perhaps some of the buyers are experiencing some difficulty getting a mortgage. I didn't hear that followed up with any specific commentary about move to ARMs, let's say, or increase, which I wouldn't expect actually, but -- or increased cancellation rates or a move within your communities to buying the smaller footprints or maybe more attached product, anything like that. Is there some sort of quantification or more detail you can provide to suggest -- to back up your comment that maybe some of the buyers are seeing an affordability constraint? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Stephen, it's interesting. I'll give you just a few stats here, and then, maybe, just some color commentary to go with it. Our can rate was just under 15%. That's actually slightly lower than where we were prior year. ARM usage sits at 5%, which is down from where we were in the prior quarter. So we haven't seen a huge increase in ARMs. I think that has to do with the yield curve. There's not enough differential on the long part of the yield curve. Loan to values are still well within kind of the range that we've been operating in for the last couple of years. And credit scores for us, the loans that we actually financed through our mortgage company remain high. So I think some of the affordability challenges are really self -- probably more self-imposed by the buyers that are out shopping and they're making a decision to say, my overall payment is higher than what I'm comfortable with or higher than what I know I can afford and therefore, I'm not going to move to go into contract rather than seeing buyers actually sign up and get declined. And if that were the case, I think you'd see a lot of stats, so I just talked about increase. Operator : Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Susan Maklari : Ryan, last quarter you had mentioned, how you guys were also watching your web traffic and using that as an indirect indicator for how you expected sort of demand to come through over the next quarter. I guess have you seen anything change there? Are buyers still coming to your website? Is there anything in terms of the time they're spending or some of the product or the specificities that they're looking at? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Susan, great question. We're seeing a very good traffic to the website as well as into the stores. So both metrics are important. The website traffic is a leading indicator, and we continue to see positive year-over-year gains in the amount of web traffic that's coming on to the website. And then as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw a 15% increase in store traffic at our physical models, which is probably the more important factor at the end of the day. Susan Maklari : Okay. And then your SG&A this quarter was really impressive relative to what we had modeled in there. Can you talk to maybe some of the factors that drove that? And maybe how we should be thinking about it going forward? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Susan, it's Bob. Certainly, it's been a focus of ours, candidly, since, well, always. But in particular, in 2016, we took some pretty big actions. We are, like I said, in our planning process so we'll wait till the fourth quarter to give you an update on what we see going forward. But the guide we gave for Q4, I think shows you that we continue to expect to see strong performance there. Yes, we're focused on all the things, so -- as we're going through planning. We're challenging all of the spend across the entire organization. I think, as an example, if we were to achieve the lower end of our guide this year for the fourth quarter, it puts us well within the range that we gave for the year, and certainly, improvement over the fourth quarter of last year. Ryan Marshall : And Susan, the only thing I'd maybe add to that is, as far as kind of future leverage I'd expect that to come from volume growth as opposed to structural change within how we're operating. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Stephen East : Ryan, just following on John's question about how you change product, et cetera. The things you were talking about, incentives on options, lot premiums, financing, et cetera. I assume that's more in the short run and has that negative gross margin effect. As you think about as you enter the spring selling season, how much can you do and what could you do to change the cost input, if you will, of the product? And maybe move that affordability conundrum that the consumer is facing, maybe move it down a little bit? And is that on your radar screen in a big way? Do you reposition for the spring, I guess, is what I'm asking? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen. What I would tell you is similar to Bob's comment from a few questions ago. We're always grinding over what the cost input side of the business is. And our procurement teams, I believe, are best-in-class, and they're always working with our suppliers to put different products in, buy better to ensure that we win, and we want our suppliers to win as well. So that's certainly a focus. As far as kind of repositioning de-contenting houses, taking options out, those are steps that we're always cautious and hesitant to make because I think buyers know what they want and they want what they want. And so it's a tricky kind of tightrope walk to take things and options out of houses in an effort to lower prices. But certainly, something that we've done in the past and we're capable of doing, but it's a territory that I venture into cautiously. I think we've done a really nice job in all of our groups, our procurement group, our sales group, our operations team in putting the right options in that consumers want and can afford based on the way that we've targeted and positioned individual communities. So look, I go back to some of the things that I said a minute ago, Stephen. We still think that the underlying fundamentals of the market are strong, we're certainly in a little bit of a tougher period of time right now. But I don't know that I would expect that to continue for an extended period of time. Stephen East : Okay. All right, fair enough. That's helpful. And then my typical capital allocation. With the slowdown, are you seeing land deals re-trading or is the market sort of stalled bid-ask spread if you will? Are you still approving land deals at the same rate, so to speak? And then I guess a couple of other things. How do you decide between share repurchase and land in development, particularly given what all these equities have done? And then finally, the M&A, again with the market meltdown, has your view changed any at all? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, that was a good way of getting more than one question into the question. So I'll try and cover the gamut there. Land spend, it is still a competitive market out there, Stephen. And pricing doesn't change, I think no different than any other point in time. If we see market conditions change and this is a very local conversation around an asset that we have under contract or other folks have under contract, you'll see it. You'll see re-trades happen where there's something that happens locally. So I would characterize that as being very much the same today. In terms of the dialogue inside this company, as it relates to repurchases versus land spend, I'd remind you, the way we've characterized it is, the first and foremost priority that we have is to invest in the business as long as we can do it at high returns. We use excess capital to repurchase our stock, pay our dividend and if we choose to, pay down some debt. And so you saw us move a little bit more money into the equity during this quarter than you had in the prior couple of quarters. We've said it long that we're not stock pickers but we have an opinion about the value of the equity, and so that gets reflected in how much we choose to invest. As does our expectation for the business going forward and our longer term needs for capital, that won't change even with the equities being a little bit cheaper than they were, say, six months ago. And on M&A, I'd characterize us as isn't always on fire. We don't do a lot of deals because we're pretty picky about pricing. And so notwithstanding the fact that you're referencing clearly a public enterprise that we'd be thinking about. The same dynamic is true today as it was 3, 6, 9 months ago, a year ago. And that is, for something like that for us it would have to be a good strategic fit. And then it would have to be a good social fit too. Just because the equities have traded down doesn't mean that management teams believe their company is worth less, and I would start with ours. So just because the equities have moved to a lower price point doesn't mean that things get remarkably cheaper, especially on a relative basis. So for us it's always about strategic fit, how and where does their land book serve us and either bolster an existing position or benefit us by virtue of some, whether it's a different geography or different demographic in places where we operate. I think I got it all. Operator : Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Carl Reichardt : Can I go back to Susan's question on SG&A for a second. As typically in the past you've called out if there's been onetime items in SG&A that have helped or hurt. Was there anything onetime this quarter that drove that SG&A below guide? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: No, Carl. Typically, you're right. We call out stuff that's significant. This was the first time in a while, thankfully, a pretty clean quarter. So it's really just the business. Carl Reichardt : Okay, good. And then just a broader question for you Ryan. So if you look at what you have done to date, whether it's incentives or lot premiums, base price cuts, whatever. I'm trying to get a sense of what the response has been from the consumer from an elasticity standpoint? Because the worry is always, well, prices fall that scares the consumer away as opposed to stimulating demand. Can you give me sort of a high-level sense of which incentives or declines, however you want to describe it are the consumers responding to elastically, and are there particular markets or price points where you're seeing that elasticity response the greatest? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Carl, I think for the most part, the incentives that we've put in place have been very targeted against specific communities and specific MSAs where we felt like maybe the overall market had moved and we needed to make adjustments to be more competitive. And I don't believe that we've done anything that is so large that it would have rocked the confidence of the consumer in a way that you would describe. So as far as, kind of what did we get out of it, and what's the overall elasticity like. Hard to know what you would have gotten if you wouldn't have made adjustments. I don't have that kind of magic eight ball. I think we made appropriate decisions based on what we were seeing in the market. And for us, in this quarter, generated 1% growth year-over-year. So it's definitely a tougher operating environment out there. And I think we tried to be fairly transparent with our comments on that. There are a couple of markets that I would tell you we're on the higher priced end, like in Northern California and in Seattle, where I think the incentives there have gotten a little larger mostly because the prices had run so far and so fast, and it may have created a bit of paralysis in the market. I think in both of those locations, overall, supply is so tight, and there's such a shortage of inventory that I think it's short term in nature and that market will -- both those markets will free up and go back to more normal selling patterns soon enough. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Michael Rehaut : I just want to go back kind of bigger picture and kind of piecing together some of the different comments that you've made so far this call. And if I'm interpreting it right, and I'd love, obviously, your thoughts on this. It seems like the approach you're taking against a market that perhaps has moved incentives a little bit more than yourselves, although, you're making your adjustments on your own as you point at your gross margins being at the lower end of your guidance. But it seems like you're taking a fairly gradual approach, not getting too aggressive given your comments around still strong traffic. Perhaps trying to wait it out, make some adjustments, but still in effect trying to hold on to a strong gross margin and being okay with a softer -- relatively softer maybe low single-digit, let's say, growth rate. Is that the right way to think about it in this current backdrop? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, I probably would characterize it a little bit different than what you've described. What I would start with is, we don't have a lot of spec inventory. In fact we've got right around 500 finished specs on the ground today. And so the way we've built our business is we're selling dirt to be built orders. And so I think that puts us in a better position not to get into a desperate type position as the inventory starts to build, which we all know creates lots of -- has capital implications as well as cost implications as that inventory builds. And you maybe -- if you're in a situation where you had a lot of inventory, you may be facing or feeling more pressure to take bigger incentives. So as far as how we're behaving, I think we're using good judgment, Mike, in making pricing decisions to run the best business that we can for our shareholders. And I think the decisions that we've made are reflective of that mentality that we want to maintain the market share that we have. Growth is an important part of our business, so is profitability, and we're managing all those levers on a community-by-community basis within the overall environment that we're operating in. The local share and efficiency of production is certainly important and that gets factored into those overall pricing decisions that we make as well. So to say we're going to wait it out, hold on to margin, that's not who we are. And I don't think that's an appropriate characterization. Michael Rehaut : Okay. No, I appreciate that response, it's helpful, obviously. I guess, secondly, perhaps you gave a little bit more color just now on Northern California and Seattle. I was hoping to get similar maybe a little bit more granularity in terms of what you're seeing in Texas, I believe you characterized it as generally strong. I don't know if there -- maybe you could across the top 3 or 4 markets, maybe give a little more color there. And when you talked about the Southeast region being a little more challenged from the hurricane, I was curious if you had a sense of what that might have impacted from -- in terms of an order growth standpoint. What the hit might have been to that region if you have any sense, excluding that event? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike. So I'll start with Texas. Texas was generally strong across the board, breaking down the four markets that we operate in. Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, all performed well. Houston was the one market that for us, anyway, was a bit slower. As far as the Southeast goes, couple of things there. The hurricane certainly had an impact. We've got large operations, all up and down the coastal part of South Carolina, where -- from Myrtle Beach to Wilmington to Charleston to Hilton Head, all of those areas were certainly impacted and then, to a lesser degree into Charlotte and Raleigh. So we haven't quantified what the impact was. And frankly, I think given the numbers that we delivered, we're not going to kind of get into the weeds there. I would tell you that other thing in the Southeast that had some bearing on our results for the quarter is we had to close out of several of the John Wieland communities that we got with that original acquisition. So as those have closed out and not all of them have been replaced on a one-for-one basis, that's had a big -- bit of impact in our Southeast numbers. And then the move-up business in that particular area was a tad slower. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Micenko with SIG. John Micenko : One of the strategies for Pulte over the last several years has been that lot premium option piece. And we've watched it kind of grow high single digits year to year. I think you said $82,000 a home. So I guess that'd be right around 20% of ASP. When do we hit terminal velocity there? Is there still ability to grow that number? How do we think about it? Because it's relevant to this discussion around incentives and options and that sort of thing. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Jack, this is Ryan. It's a good question. I think we've struck the right balance where the goal and the objective there is to provide consumers with the flexibility that they want in picking the lot that they want to live on, and they're able to pick the things that are important to them as they configure their home. I think that works out into a more profitable equation for us, and creates a happier homeowner in that they're able to get the things that they truly value. As far as where that can grow, I don't believe that it can go to infinity. And so I think you've started to see the growth rate of that slow over the last couple of quarters. And it's basically grown in lockstep with our ASP growth. So we feel pretty good about where we're at, but it's something that we'll continue to look at in the overall value equation that the consumer considers when they're making a buying decision. John Micenko : Okay. And then I guess the best analogue we have to the move-in rates this year is probably 2013 on a post-crisis basis. Obviously, the economy is better, but home prices are a lot higher now. Can you just talk about some of the observations, maybe compare, contrast '13 relative to the sort of traffic conversion disconnect you've been seeing? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Jack. I think you've highlighted the biggest change that I -- or the biggest difference that I see is 2013, the rate increases then were against an economic backdrop that is nowhere near what it is today. So economically, with GDP growing at 3.7%, unemployment at less than 3%. We're actually seeing some wage expansion. Consumer confidence is much higher. So just the whole kind of gamut of economic indicators are so much better today. That being said, the difference between -- one of the other big differences is asset prices are much higher today than what they were in 2013. So the overall equation of home price plus the absolute interest rate, I think that's created a package that is radically different from where we were 6 to 9 months ago. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, but I think it bears repeating. And that is you've got a fair number of homeowners that are in existing homes that likely have interest rates sub-3%. And there may be a little bit of reluctance to give up on that interest rate as you consider moving now. I think time and life will kind of take care of that. Buyers are going to continue to have life events that create needs to sell and move or upsize, whether it's marriage, divorce, birth, job relocation, retirement, et cetera. I think those are some things that we'll continue to see. And Jack, I think you see the data just like we do. Rates are expected to continue to go up. The Fed is not signaling that they're going to slow down at all with rate increases as long as the economy continues to motor on at the rate that it is. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Dahl : First quick question. As you quantify the level of discounts and closings in 3Q at 3%. Can you give us a sense of on the orders that you signed in 3Q. What the average discounts were? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, we've historically not done that. Honestly, we're still going through the process of finalizing the optionality built into that, et cetera. So that will come when we give you our guide for next year. Obviously, we've given you a guide for Q4, which tells you that things have held up. Again, that might have been things that were sold through the second quarter. So more to come on that, but typically we wouldn't give you that kind of details because we just don't have it all yet. Michael Dahl : Got it, okay. The second question is really a bit more high level. I think the Pulte, in the recent past has been maybe more balanced than peers in terms of thinking about kind of the broader customer segmentation in terms of entry level versus move up. There's a popular belief out there today that entry level or first time is still the relatively strong part of the market and where people want to shift to. Your own trend suggest a little bit different. I know you pointed out a couple of reasons why you may be different than some of your peers there, but I'm curious more on a high level. If we think about affordability as becoming more challenging. And that buyer -- almost by definition, the marginal buyer being most impacted by affordability. How are your views changing on where Pulte's mix should be going forward from a segmentation standpoint? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, I appreciate the question. This is Ryan. I would agree with you that, that buyer group is the most rate-sensitive buyer. And in terms of kind of how that affects our view about long-term segmentation. I would tell you it's largely unchanged. We'd like to see 35% of our business in the first time entry level space. Our closings at this point that are coming through the business are closer to 30%, but the land that we control for that first time entry-level space is right at the 35% that we've targeted. So you'll start to see those closings come through our business over the course of the next couple of years as we develop and monetize that land pipeline. I would tell you -- the other thing that is worth highlighting and it is part of the reason that we love the active adult business so much. All of the conversation has kind of moved to the millennials and to the entry levels, but there is still a lot of boomers out there, they have high homeownership rates. And this is a buyer group that, for us anyway, 40% of them pay cash, and so they're much less interest-rate sensitive, which works to our advantage. And I think this is just kind of a great example of why we continue to invest in that space, and why we've tried to maintain a balanced position with the different consumer groups that we serve. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our allotted time for Q&A. I would now like to turn the conference over back to Mr. Jim Zeumer for closing comments. James Zeumer : Great. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. And again, I apologize for any technical difficulties you had dialing in. We'll certainly be available for questions over the course of the day. And we'll look forward to talking to you on the next call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines. And thank you for joining us this morning.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead, sir. James Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Abby, and good morning. I want to welcome everyone to this morning\u2019s call to discuss PulteGroup's fourth quarter 2018 operating and financial results. I'm joined on this morning by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance. The copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post the replay of today's call to our website a little later on. I want to highlight that as part of today's presentation call, we will be discussing our reported results as well as our results adjusted to exclude the impact of certain significant items. A reconciliation of these adjusted results to our reported results is included in this morning\u2019s release and within the webcast slides accompanying this call. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our results.  Before I turn the call over to Ryan, I also want to alert everyone that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about the Company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. With our strong fourth quarter results now reported, we completed a very positive year in which we achieved critical operating and financial goals against with we measure the performance of our business. Included in the key metrics we track is our ability to invest in and purposely grow our business and we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls that we look to grow our business consistent with or slightly faster than the overall new home market.  With 2018 closings up 10% to just over 23,000 homes, we achieved that objective last year. 10% more closings in combination with an 8% increase in average selling price allowed PulteGroup to drive an 18% or $1.5 billion gain in annual homebuilding revenues to $9.8 billion.  Our 2018 revenues are the fourth highest in the history of PulteGroup and by far the highest in the past dozen years. So we appreciate the effort required to achieve these results. For PulteGroup it\u2019s not just about growth, but forecast \u2013 but focusing on profitable growth which is why it also highlight our industry-leading gross margins. While we do not run the business to achieve a specific gross margin, we understand its power in driving earnings. Having said that, we are continuing to run the business with a view towards generating high returns on invested capital by balancing price and pace on a community-by-community basis. The 18% increase in homebuilding revenues also allowed us to realize meaningful overhead leverage which in combination with our more efficient homebuilding operations and lower share count drove the company\u2019s significant earnings gains in 2018. PulteGroup\u2019s success this past year also reflects the tremendous time, effort and skill provided by all of our employees. Employees who, in addition to building great homes have built incredible culture that ranks among the top 5% of companies globally as measured by Gallop. I want to offer a sincere thank you to each of them for delivering the great experience to our home buyers and our shareholders. In addition to a lot of hard work, our growth in 2018 also reflects ongoing investments we\u2019ve been making in the business. Over the past four years, we\u2019ve invested over $10 billion in land acquisition and development, but have done so with a clear focus on building a more efficient land pipeline.  The result is that we\u2019ve successfully shortened the duration of our own lots which is now below four years, while simultaneously increasing option lots, which now represents 40% of our controlled lot position. I would also point out that with roughly 54% of 2018\u2019s approved lots being controlled via option, we expect to make further progress going forward. To put our current land portfolio in perspective, at the end of 2014, we owned almost six years of land with only a quarter of the pipeline held via option.  We firmly believe that our more efficient land pipeline and help support high returns while reducing the market risk associated with owning longer land positions.  Another benefit of our disciplined land acquisition process is the capital efficiency it has helped us generate, which allows us to be balanced and more shareholder-friendly with our overall capital allocation.  In 2018, we used excess capital to repurchase nearly $300 million of PulteGroup\u2019s common shares while also paying out over $100 million in dividends since re-establishing our dividend and share repurchase programs in 2013, we have returned nearly $3 million of capital to shareholders while retiring approximately 31% of our outstanding shares. As we have stated, we are managing our business against the defined objectives of growing pre-tax income while working to deliver appropriate risk-adjusted returns on invested capital over the housing cycle. Our 2018 results demonstrate that we continue to successfully execute this disciplined and balanced approach to the business and that we and shareholders continue to reap the benefits. As strong as our 2018 operating and financial performance was, the reality is that the numbers reflect an outstanding spring selling season followed by an industry-wide softening of demand beginning late in the second quarter. To widely varying degrees, this change has been felt across all buyer groups in most if not all markets across the country.  This is setting up 2019 to be more of a challenging year. Many point to the rise in interest rates that accelerated in Q2 of 2018 is the trigger for the changing consumer behavior, I think the rise in interest rates maybe better viewed as the proverbial final straw rather than a trigger as it came on top of several years of home price appreciation and growing affordability challenges.  The combination of these things, coupled with global trade and geopolitical unrest was enough to move potential buyers to the sidelines and create a general sense of uncertainty. Consistent with much of the commentary issued over the past several weeks, we too experienced a sequential improvement in qualified buyer traffic to our communities as interest rates moved lower. On a per store basis, traffic was lower in October and November compared with last year but the trend turned positive in December. Given this is the seasonally slow part of the year however, I would encourage just all not too read much into the data. Thinking about 2019, there is less certainty about demand heading into this spring selling season than the industry has experienced in a number of years. We have seen forecast for U.S. new home sales ranging from up 5% or more to down 5% or more.  If demand conditions accelerate, and absorption rates improve, we have the communities, inventory and lots available to meet that demand, at the same time, we have the balance sheet to continue investing in the growth of the business.  If however, demand in the upcoming spring selling season remains soft, we will work closely with our local operators in assessing each community\u2019s prospects with an eye toward delivering the best risk-adjusted returns. For some communities, this could mean working to drive greater absorption pace while others may look to maintain price and margins.  There is no one size fits all answer for how each community will be run, but rather a thoughtful balanced approach to managing the company in its entirety. It is worth highlighting that we remain constructive on the market.  As a result, we believe there is potential for improving or at least more stable demand due to the fact that broader \u2013 the broader operating environment remains strong in terms of a growing economy, great jobs numbers, rising wages and continued high levels of consumer confidence.  Fortunately and finally, I feel confident about how our business is positioned to navigate the year however it plays out. We have a great team, great product, and great assets and the actions that we\u2019ve taken over the past few years to shorten the duration of our land pipeline to increase options, to drive our margin performance and to enhance our balance sheet puts us in a position to operate from a position of strength.  Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Bob? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. PulteGroup completed 2018 by posting another quarter of strong financial results. As noted in this morning\u2019s press release, the company\u2019s reported fourth quarter numbers were impacted by several significant items. In my remarks, I will be addressing both our reported and our adjusted results. As Jim mentioned, we\u2019ve provided a reconciliation of our reported to our adjusted results in the press release we issued this morning, as well as in the slides we posted in connection with this webcast. Consistent with recent commentary related to the housing market, we experienced softer demand during the fourth quarter relative to the same period last year and to our third quarter of this on a seasonally-adjusted basis.  For the quarter, we reported net sign-ups of 4267 homes, which is down 11% from last year. As has been the case for much of 2018, our active adult business outperformed our more traditional communities with our active adult communities up 1% while first time and move up communities were both lower by 15%. While sign-ups were lower, same-store traffic trends improved in the quarter \u2013 improved as the quarter progressed and we sold more houses in December than in November. These data points reinforce the view that buyer interest remains high and that we may be facing more of a temporary pause in demand as markets and buyers reset. However, as Ryan stated, the fourth quarter is our slowest quarter seasonally that we aren\u2019t reading too much into the recent results.  As with net sign-ups our absorption pace has also slowed in the fourth quarter declining 14% compared with the prior year. Absorption paces were lower across each buyer groups decreasing 24% among first-time buyers, 13% among move-up buyers, and 9% among active adult buyers. While those buyers were slower to sign contracts in the fourth quarter, we entered the quarter with a large backlog of sold homes which allowed us to deliver excellent financial results in the period. Homebuilding revenues in the quarter increased 6% over 2017 to $2.9 billion. The higher revenues for the quarter were the result of a 5% or $20,000 increase in the average sales price of homes closed of $430,000 along with the 1% increase in closings to 6709 homes. The 5% increase in our average sales price for the period reflects price increases realized across all buyer groups. For the quarter, average sales prices among first-time buyers was up 15% over last year to $375,000, while our ASP for move-up buyers increased just under 1% to $477,000 and our active adult prices gained 4% to $405,000. The 15% increase in ASP among first-time buyers was driven by price increases realized across the number of markets, along with additional closings for certain communities in the Bay area of Northern California which sell at much higher prices. In the quarter, closings by buyer group breakdown as follows; 27% were first-time, 46% move-up and 27% active adults which is comparable to last year\u2019s results. We ended the year with a total of 9491 homes under construction, of which 6245 or 66% were sold units and 3246 or 34% were specs. I\u2019d like to point out that we elected to allow spec production to run higher than the recent quarters to ensure access to production trade and to position communities heading into 2019. This is a tactical decision as we expect spec production will come back in line as the year progresses. With 715 finished specs, still less than one per community, we remain comfortable with our production ahead of the spring selling season and like the opportunity these used to provide to meet any buyer demand for a quicker close. Our reported gross margin for the fourth quarter of 21.5% includes $67 million of land impairment driven primarily by a project in our Mid-Atlantic market. Excluding the impact of impairments, our adjusted fourth quarter gross margin was 23.8%, which is consistent with last year\u2019s adjusted gross margin. The Mid-Atlantic project we impaired related to an asset that we acquired in 2005 with the expectation it would ultimately be entitled for more than 1000 lots.  Now, 14 years later, the project has still not received final approval and recent quarterly points we anticipated density being cut by almost two-thirds. It has been and remains our intention to build on this site, but the economics associated with the expected ultimate approval did not support the carrying value of our investments. This is yet another reminder of why we no longer buy un-entitled land.  In addition to the land impairment charges related to this project, we also wrote-off approximately $5 million of deposits relating to a contagious parcel we controlled as part of that project as that element of the project was no longer deemed economical in today\u2019s market at the newly projected density. That charge has been reflected in other income expense on our income statement.  During the quarter, we also recorded approximately $7 million of cost to reflect higher post-closing performance obligations relating to a previously sold asset which has been reflected in land sales cost of revenues on our income statement. While market conditions are more competitive, we continue to successfully execute key sales practices which has helped drive our revenue and margin performance over the years. This includes our strategic pricing methodology, through which we seek to ensure that we are priced competitively in the market, while continuing to realize value from options and lot premiums. In the fourth quarter, our option revenues and lot premiums increased 8.3% or approximately $5400 over last year to more than $83,000 per home. Sales discounts in the fourth quarter came in just under $15,000 per home or about $3.3% of average sales price. This is an increase of ten basis points over the fourth quarter of last year and is up 30 basis points for the third quarter of this year. Reported SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was $292 million or 10.1% of home sale revenues. Our SG&A in the quarter reflects modest increases in incentive compensation and sales commissions. Fourth quarter 2017 SG&A expense of $202 million or7.4% of home sale revenues included a $66 million pre-tax benefit from insurance-related adjustments.  Last year\u2019s adjusted SG&A expense was $268 million or 9.8% of home sale revenue. In the fourth quarter, our financial services business reported pre-tax income of $5 million, compared with $23 million in the fourth quarter of last year. In the current year quarter, we reported a $16 million adjustment to our mortgage origination reserves as we sell the claim tied to mortgages issued prior to the last housing collapse.  Beyond this adjustment, our financial services business continued to operate in a competitive market environment, which impacted our capture rate and margin. In the fourth quarter, our capture rate declined to 77% from 81% last year. Our reported income tax expense for the fourth quarter was $92 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 27.9%.  The higher rate relative to our guide reflects $14.1 million of expense relating to valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets and a $6.9 million benefit relating to a tax method change. Looking ahead to 2019, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25.3%. For the quarter, our reported net income was $238 million compared with $77 million last year. On an adjusted basis, our fourth quarter 2018 net income increased 24% over last year to $314 million.  Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter totaled $1.11 which is an increase of 31% over the fourth quarter of last year. Diluted EPS for the quarter was calculated using approximately 280 million shares, which is a decrease of 13 million shares or 4% from the fourth quarter of last year. The lower share count was driven primarily by the company\u2019s ongoing share repurchase program pursuant to which we bought back 10.9 million shares in 2018 at a cost of $295 million or $27 per share.  These figures include 5.1 million shares repurchased in the fourth quarter for $122 million or $24.13 per share. We ended 2018 with $1.1 billion of cash and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 39% which is down from 42% at the end of last year. On a net basis, our debt-to-capital ratio fell to 28%.  Let me conclude my review of the fourth quarter by providing a couple of additional data points on our homebuilding operation. During the fourth quarter, we operated out of 815 communities, which is up 3% over last year and in line with our guidance. Based on anticipated community openings and closings, we expect community count in 2019 to be comparable with 2018.  In the quarter, we invested $335 million in land acquisitions and approved 6400 lots for purchase. Of the lots approved in the fourth quarter, 55% were under some form of option. For the full year, we invested $1.2 billion in land acquisition, which is up 13% over last year and approved 28,000 lots. We continue to focus on smaller, faster turning transactions as the average project size is approximately 140 lots. At present, we expect our land acquisition spend for 2019 to be approximately $1.2 billion which is comparable with last year. We will also work to use option transactions when they support our objectives of enhancing returns or lowering risk.  We ended 2018 with approximately $150,000 lots under control, of which 40% were controlled via options with 90,000 lots owned, we continue to carry less than 40 years of owned land. With 54% of the lots we approved in 2018 being under option, we are successfully executing into our strategy of wanting to own three years of land or less. We continue to evolve a shorter, faster turning land bank which can help to improve asset turn and overall returns on invested capital while helping to lower market risk. We believe this approach grows increasingly valuable considering recent demand volatility and the dual threats of higher interest rates and/or a slowing economy which could impact overall housing demand. As noted, our traffic numbers picked up over the past several weeks, and our December sign-ups increased on a sequential basis from November, which are positive. However, given the uncertainties in the market and the broader economy, we will only be providing guidance with respect to PulteGroup\u2019s expected first quarter results at this time.  Based on our production pipeline of 9500 homes under construction, we expect Q1 2019 deliveries to be in the range of 4300 to 4600 homes with an average sales price of approximately $420,000. We continue to execute against our return-focused business model, which means that we must remain price competitive in the markets we serve.  As such, we took actions to adjust our selling efforts as market conditions improved increasingly competitive in the latter half of 2018. Given these adjustments and the lingering impact of higher lumber cost, we currently expect first quarter gross margins to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%.  As a result of our lower volumes and pricing, we expect to realize less overhead leverage with SG&A as a percent of homebuilding revenues likely approaching 13.5% in the first quarter. And finally, as I noted earlier, we expect our effective tax rate in 2019 to be approximately 25.3%. In conclusion, the company\u2019s strong operating and financial performance in the past year has us well positioned heading into 2019.  Now let me turn the call over to Ryan for a few final comments. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. As I discussed, the softer demand conditions evident the late Q2 and Q3 continued into Q4 and while we have seen better traffic over the past several weeks, it is still too early to get an accurate read on what this means for the spring selling season.  In terms of regional commentary about the quarter, like the weather, demand in the fourth quarter gotten warmer as you move from north from south both along the eastern and middle thirds of the country. Demand in our northeast and mid-west markets was challenged, but showed some improvement in December. We saw the same pattern across our Texas markets, while Florida was arguably the country\u2019s best area of demand.  And finally, out west, conditions are generally unchanged with higher price point communities in Washington and Northern California sings to our absorption paces, while demand in Phoenix is holding up reasonably well.  So as we head into 2019, and what will likely be a more challenging year, let me just quickly check off a few reasons why I am confident in PulteGroup\u2019s competitive position. We have a broad operating footprint, but with sufficient scale in the markets in which we operate, we have a diversified customer base although we are biased toward the more financially capable buyer groups. We have built a supportive and efficient land pipeline, but without having gotten overly aggressive with recent land spend. We have a strong balance sheet with tremendous financial flexibility. And maybe our biggest strengths, we have an experienced leadership team including our area and division presidents who know how to operate in changing market conditions. Let me conclude on that comment and turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? James Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Ryan. We will open the call for questions, so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the time of this call. We ask that you limit yourselves to one question and follow-up. Operator, if you would explain the process, we\u2019ll get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mike Dahl, RBC Capital Markets. Michael Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Mike. Michael Dahl : I want to just start \u2013 hi, just the discussion around the current sales environment. It sounds like you made the decision and understanding it\u2019s community-by-community, but given the competitive pressures to incentivize a bit more. Curious to get your thoughts on a couple things. First, to the extent that you are incentivizing what types of incentives are you finding to be most effective at this point? And tied into that, to what extent is, I think, Bob, you mentioned the commissions in SG&A, to what extent are Hire Co brokers influencing your SG&A? Ryan Marshall : Hey, Mike, it\u2019s Ryan. Thanks for the question and I think you hit the nail right on head. It\u2019s really on a \u2013 it\u2019s a community-by-community basis where we are making those decisions and our operators are quite skilled at evaluating the competitive set that we operate in within that specific zip code if you will or within that specific municipality.  And so we are evaluating that. In terms of what\u2019s most effective, I think we\u2019ve been quite clear to say that affordability is the challenge. And so, the incentives that we can provide that help to alleviate pressure around affordability or the things that are being most effective.  We talked about \u2013 I talked about it extensively on our last call where our general view is base price is the last thing that we like to adjust. So, we try to do it through other forms of incentives to hopefully create urgency and alleviate some of the pressure that the buyers have felt around affordability.  You saw our total discounts tick up a little teeny bit, but for the most part I think we\u2019ve been able to do it in a variety of other ways to create little bit of pressure relief on the affordability side. I\u2019ll let Bob talk about what we saw in the SG&A from added commissions. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, we obviously, we are working with the broker community. We saw probably ten basis points of incremental SG&A cost around co-brokers. Michael Dahl : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. As far as my second question and just a follow-up on the gross margins, just given your build cycle, given while you have increased your specs a bit, it\u2019s still relatively low. I understand that you are only giving the first quarter guidance. But if we think about what the actions are that you\u2019ve taken over the past several months to alleviate the affordability to increase incentives a bit?  Is this one quarter, 1Q gross margin fully reflective of the steps you\u2019ve taken or if current market conditions persist, would you expect that it might take another quarter or so to see that impact fully flow through, so that 22 to 22.5 gross margin could step a bit lower? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, fair question. We are not giving guidance beyond the first quarter. So with that having been said, certainly the sales environment over the next, call it two to three months will matter. To that, impacting our margins obviously will be lumber cost. We are still feeling the spike in pricing through the middle of the year.  So that\u2019s impacting our first and to a degree the second quarter. That will be a relative tailwind as we get to the back half of the year. And the other thing that\u2019s impacting our margins in this quarter, in the first quarter is interest expense. So, if you think about our interest expense, we did some fairly significant financing activity back in 2016. 2018 is really the first year where our total capitalized interest is equal to our expense. So we are feeling a little bit relative drag on margins.  You could see it for instance in this most recent quarter, it was probably 50 or 60 basis points, it will be less next year, it\u2019s probably 20 or 30 basis points of the margin decline that you see in the first quarter relative to the prior year. We had a couple of things moving around of it. Operator : We will take our first question from John Lovallo from Bank of America. John Lovallo : Hey guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. The first one, you guys have announced recently the expansion of Centex into a few new markets. I guess the question is, how quickly can this effort be accelerated given your current land position? And I mean, do you see this as the appropriate strategy of pushing more into Centex here? Ryan Marshall : Yes, John, it\u2019s Ryan. Thanks for the question and if I take you back to 2016, fall of 2016, one of the first earnings calls that I was on we talked about some of the shifts that we were making inside of the company to rebalance our portfolio and serve all consumer groups.  We indicated that it would be a subtle shift where we wanted to move about five points of market share from our move-up buyer into the more affordable price points. We wanted to do it the right way though, John. And so, we\u2019ve intentionally gone out and targeted land parcels that will efficiently and effectively allow us to put a more affordable product on the ground.  Certainly, we could have taken existing parcels and put more affordable product there to kind of satisfy the metric, but it\u2019s just not the way that we think about running the business. We are in this for the long-term. We have stated over and over again we are looking to drive the best possible economic outcome for our shareholders and specific to your question about being more affordable, I think that means, you go out and you target the right pieces of land to do at the right way.  What I\u2019d highlight for you, John, is that about 33%, 34% of the land that we have under control is specifically targeted to our first-time buyer group. So, while the closings today only represent about 27% of our closing volume, we see that on a go-forward inching closer and closer to what we actually have controlled as a total percentage of our overall land portfolio. John Lovallo : Okay, that\u2019s encouraging. Maybe along the same lines, do you guys have any ability to reduce square footage within your existing communities to kind of help meet this affordability challenges? Ryan Marshall : Yes, we think we are already there today, John. We offer really good flexibility within our existing product line-up that allows customers to kind of go up and down based on needs. We\u2019ve got a number of structural options that allow you to take an 1800 square foot floor plan as an example and you can add on a loft or you can stick right what the 1800 floor plan as an example.  So, I think what we are seeing from buyers, the way that they are currently buying is, they are still buying the square footage that they need to satisfy their family dynamic. They may be taking less options and cabinets or countertops or flooring upgrades to help manage the affordability pinch. But we have not seen buyers go all the way to the bottom-end of our product line-up which I think would tell you that the way we are covering the range of square footage is appropriate.  So, if we were to go there and we have in prior cycles, it takes some time. It\u2019s not just a, call the ball and you moved your lower square footage. There is obviously entitlement and permitting things that have got to be done with cities. So, something that we are capable of doing if we felt like the market was going there, we\u2019d certainly undertake the efforts to do that. But our view and you heard me say kind of in my prepared remarks, we remain constructive on the market and we think the way we are positioned today for the most part is correct. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner : Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. The first question, on the traffic commentary as far as that\u2019s seeing some improvement there in December, were they any particular price points or markets where that was most evident and has that trend continued on a year-over-year basis thus far into January? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan, we saw it really across all the markets that we operate in. So I wouldn\u2019t highlight one that\u2019s been an outlier. It was a general improvement which we take a sign and it\u2019s part of the reason that we tried to be a tad optimistic about what we\u2019ve seen in terms of traffic patterns, because it is a pretty widespread improvement and the trends have continued into January similar to what we said in December, the first two or three weeks of January are typically the very early stages of the spring selling season and we don\u2019t see that typical spring selling pick up until after really the Super Bowl first part of February is when we see things officially kick in with spring selling season. Alan Ratner : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. The second question, I think the discounting disclosures you gave, I believe is on closings. I was curious if you have that trend what it looks like on the orders that were placed in the quarter and I guess, just thinking about the spring, I fully appreciate the community-by-community discussion, but how would you articulate the strategy?  I mean, we\u2019ve heard from a few other builders effectively say definitively that that gross margin is going to be the plug and it\u2019s important to keep the volume machine running. So, how would you characterize your overarching strategy heading into the spring when you think about what you are going to prioritize that takes over price? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Alan, it\u2019s Bob. We historically haven\u2019t given color on the actual sales that we recorded, we will give ASPs. But I think what you should think about is in terms of the guide we gave for the first quarter margin, certainly we are seeing some margin erosion as a result of the sales environment that we saw in the \u2013 what we highlighted in the prepared remarks was, the back half of the year that\u2019s \u2013 if we\u2019ve got whole in a five months build cycle, you\u2019ve got most of the third quarter embodied, sorry, third and fourth quarter embodied in that guide that we\u2019ve given. So that should give you some insight as to the discounting we got to do. Ryan Marshall : And then Alan, just in terms of your question about what will we prioritize, I would probably going to sound a little bit like a broken record, but we will continue to make pace and price decisions on a community-by-community basis and do it with an eye toward what we believe gives us the most favorable economic outcome.  Certainly, your comment about keeping the production machine going factors into that overall equation, we are a production builder. You\u2019ve heard me say in the last couple of conference calls that volume matters and it does to us and it certainly does to our competitors\u2019 tray. We are all competing for a limited number of trades and the ability to keep a consistent production volume going in our communities is a big deal. It was part of the reason that we \u2013 it\u2019s part of the reason that you saw us make the tactical decision to increase our spec production just a little teeny bit. The other thing that we think about too just from an overhead efficiency standpoint is making sure that if we accelerate pace, that we actually have a new community to move into, so, is the land pipeline positioned such that if we close out earlier, you can move the team to the next location.  So, those are all things that we take into consideration as we go through that community-by-community analysis. I think what you\u2019ve seen from us is, consistent and balanced view where we have continued to worked to drive the volume in the right spots. But we have maintained some level of the superior gross margin profile that we\u2019ve worked to build over time. But we haven\u2019t \u2013 with a single eye or single vision held on to it, you\u2019ve seen some of that erode, as we work to be competitive. Operator : We will take our next question from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much guys. Thanks for all the color. I guess, my first question relates to the quick move in home commentary. I think, Ryan, you just mentioned you increased your specs just a teeny little bit. When we\u2019ve been out in the field, we\u2019ve noticed that folks \u2013 customers have been a little reluctant to pay up for rate locks going out much more than a few months and so, the biggest amount of activity or demand has been on homes that they can move into relatively quickly without having to pay for such a long way block. I was curious therefore, to what degree doing more specs to maybe take advantage of buyer demand and also you mentioned some labor efficiencies. Whether you thought that there may be some opportunity to make this a little bit more of a lasting change and just to get a sense for how you are thinking about this spec activity? Is it purely temporary or perhaps maybe something that might be more lasting? Ryan Marshall : Stephen, I would expect this to be temporary from us. We\u2019ve done extensive work and feel that we end up with a better long-term outcome by running more of a built-to-order model and I think that\u2019s what you should continue to expect to see from us. I think we\u2019ve got other tools that we have effectively used with rate buy-downs and longer term rate locks that allow us to give the customers that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations enough protection to give them confidence to buy. So, I think you will see us over the quarters over the next several months and few quarters revert back to our typical spec cadence. Stephen Kim : Okay. And that\u2019s helpful. And then, regarding the \u2013 the comments you\u2019ve made regarding the spring selling season or the pre-season here thus far, I think you mentioned that traffic improvement in the last several weeks, well, but too early to make a call on all that, I was curious if \u2013 and you also mentioned you are still constructive on the market. So, two-part question here, regarding your comments about the tone of business and on the traffic side, is it your view that the data you\u2019ve seen on traffic has been a little too choppy to have conviction around the direction things are going?  And has maybe there been less interest reflected in deposits than there has been in traffic? Is that a part of your view that maybe it\u2019s little too early to make a call? And secondly, regarding your comments about being still constructive on the market, I am wondering how much this constructiveness is a reflection of maybe seeing some strength in December and January and if there is anything that you might see in the next month or two, that would make you go less constructive. So that when we speak to you next time, you would be less constructive than you are today. Ryan Marshall : Well, I am going to politely probably take a pass on the last part of that question, because, I think it would be asking me to peer into a crystal ball. So, we\u2019ve obviously got a number of scenarios that we look at here, Stephen.  But I will probably avoid rolling many of those out on this call. In terms of kind of traffic and what\u2019s happened and the reasons why we are constructive, I think that\u2019s very relevant conversation question. What I\u2019d highlight is on a same-store basis, adjusting for community count in the fourth quarter in total was down year-over-year.  So that\u2019s the negative. Now the positive is that, the November and December got sequentially better and by the time we got to December, we were on a community count adjusted basis, we were showing positive comps year-over-year and that has continued into January. So, that\u2019s part of the reason that I think we are slightly optimistic about what the spring selling season will hold. I think in terms of kind of the affordability pinch that I highlighted in my prepared remarks, and I would highlight it again here, I think that\u2019s been the challenge with buyers is there has been an affordability pinch and then there has been a steady stream of kind of negative news if you will that plays out in the media and the newspapers almost every single day about the real estate market and that ultimately I think factors into the psyche of a buyer when they are getting ready to make a major life purchase like buying a home, some north of $400,000.  So, if interest rates can maintain some stability, I think that\u2019s certainly a factor. We need to continue to see some wage growth and I think the rate of price appreciation is to moderate just a tad and not further exacerbate the affordability crisis. So, some things, as far as big picture and I was kidding a little bit with my initial commentary about things that we are looking at into the future and that could change it for the positive or the negative.  But to big picture, we are always looking at consumer confidence. That\u2019s something that I think is a big deal and I highlighted that just a second ago with the buyer psyche. So, what\u2019s going on with the job picture, job adds, et cetera on a market-by-market basis.  Certainly, we would pay attention to traffic trends and then deterioration or improvement in overall sales volume and then any kind of quick or unexpected rate hikes would certainly also be the other kind of big picture factor that we would look to over the coming months that could significantly improve or erode how we feel about the spring selling season. Operator : We will take our next question from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Ken Zener : Good morning gentlemen. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hi, Ken. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Ken. Ken Zener : Ryan, last quarter I asked you about kind of your view about existing inventory. I know we\u2019re talking about price and affordability and interest rates, but just want to ask again, I mean, do you think the existing inventory is tight and I ask because it would seem to potentially impact your traded buyers which are \u2013 obviously, a lot of your buyers, could you talk about how or what you are seeing out there? Ryan Marshall : Yes, broadly, I would tell you that inventory levels are in the \u2013 what I\u2019d consider the healthy zone. We have always pegged it at six months of supply and most markets are still running well below that. There are still a few markets that are less than three months of supply. So, I would tell you, Ken, there is not a lot that\u2019s changed in the last quarter with the existing inventory supply. Ken Zener : Okay. And then, getting your comments around, asking A, in 1Q, I know you gave us a percent of just looking back on 2018, is there a fixed dollar value that we should think about for SG&A? I apologize if I haven\u2019t \u2013 lot of your commissions here are variable cost, right. I am just trying to see how much that\u2019s going to swing around five quarter based on volumes, so\u2026 Ryan Marshall : Ken, I don\u2019t know that there is a \u2013 sort of a fixed dollar level. You should think about our commissions generally run around 3.5% and I think everything else is variable in the medium-term. So, we feel pretty good about the SG&A that we delivered this year. We highlighted that we were little bit outside of our guide for the fourth quarter, but certainly well within or actually better than our guide for the full year. We had a good year.  So there was some compensation in the fourth quarter. We highlighted the commission. So, I think, it will be determined candidly by volume, right. And so, where the volume wins look, what has it, we think we\u2019ve got pretty good controls over our expenses right now. And certainly, if there are places where we see the business not materializing to the level that we think it should be, we would look at costs there.  So, again, it\u2019s not fixed versus variable, because candidly, everything is variable in the medium-term for us and we feel pretty good about what we delivered in 2018 and we would expect to maintain that same level of discipline in 2019. Operator : We will take our next question from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Nishu Sood : Thank you. So, appreciate all the commentary about traffic. Wanting to ask about orders. Bob, I think you mentioned December orders were higher than they were in November which I think seasonally is a typical. If I looked at it on a year-over-year basis, did that also register an improvement in the year-over-year order pace? And then, how have orders looked? Are they better or worse in January? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, we haven\u2019t provided any commentary on January. I don\u2019t have it in front of me the December versus December and we have to look at communities, Nishu, but we can get that for you. Nishu Sood : Okay, thanks. And second question, the demand weakness that you mentioned across all buyer groups, I think is how you characterize it. That \u2013 the kind of prevailing view out there is that the weakness has been mainly to the move-up and much less so at the first-time buyer. Just wanted to understand your different take on the market if we can look at it that way, perhaps one thought that occurs to me is that, your first-time buyer category is at a price point of 375, which would be move-up for a lot of buyers. Is that the difference? Can you just help us understand your perspective about the demand trends across the buyer groups please? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Nishu, our first-time to your point does include some higher price point communities and it\u2019s mostly being driven by Northern California and Seattle. We\u2019ve got some truly first-time communities there that are at price points that are north of $700,000.  So, that somewhat influences that. If you\u2019re to carve that out, we do still tend to run at the higher end of the first-time price point spectrum and we\u2019ve seen a softening if you will, with those buyers just likely had with the move up. We have seen nice strength in the active adult side.  This particular quarter we are basically flat on an absorption level. But it is one buyer group that has held up quite nicely for us. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: And Nishu, just to follow-up, December 2018 versus December 2017 was actually a little bit weaker. It was actually up about 4%, but that was an improvement compared to October versus October and November versus November. So we\u2019ve got relative performance and I\u2019d highlight for you that the fourth quarter of last year was pretty strong. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning everyone. First question. I was just a little confused by comment earlier around sales on a same community basis which sounds like sales pace or sales per community. Did I hear right that December was up year-over-year in sales pace?  It doesn\u2019t seem that way particularly if orders are down \u2013 were down in the quarter. I just wanted to kind of understand how sales pace progressed throughout the quarter on a year-over-year basis, months-to-month and if I did hear right or you did mean to say that sales pace was up year-over-year in December. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, I think it\u2019s the same question that we just answered for Nishu. We actually saw absorptions down year-over-year, but improving through the quarter. Michael Rehaut : Okay, so was it down 4% - was that, I thought that was just orders not sales per community? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: That is correct. Sales per community would be down also, because community count was up. Ryan Marshall : And Mike, I think the comment that you are referring to that Bob made in his prepared remarks on an absolute basis, we sold more homes in December in 2018 than we did in November of 2018. We are simply trying to make the point that the market improved for us based on our current book as we moved into the back half of the year or the back-end of the year \u2013 back-end of the fourth quarter. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Sequentially through the quarter. Michael Rehaut : Okay. Now that\u2019s helpful. I guess, just secondly, when you kind of think more broadly in terms of where we are right now, I mean, obviously a lot of builders expressing kind of a holding off of guidance and the spring selling season as you\u2019ve mentioned before Ryan, kind of a bigger variable or question mark this year going in than several previous years. How are you seeing it from the incentive side on a broader market basis?  We heard from Hordon late last week that there was a big move in incentives that they put into the market in November and perhaps that help them re-establish pace, but obviously at significantly lower margins. I was curious about when you kind of did the step-up in incentives during your 4Q, if that helped perhaps stabilize pace, I guess, it\u2019s still down year-over-year for you guys in December. But, I guess, it\u2019s really a two-parter. Number one, when did you step up in incentives during 4Q? And at this point if sales pace continues where it is, do you need a further step up to at least get that sales pace to be on the positive side? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, there is a lot in there. I\u2019ll do my best, I think at least in spirit I talk to some of the things that I think you are asking and I\u2019d summarize it by \u2013 what I am hearing you ask is our incentive is effective at increasing sales pace and I would tell you it has been or we wouldn\u2019t do it.  And our pricing model is such that, on a real-time basis, we are evaluating every single community on a community-by-community basis as we talked about and we are putting the incentives where we think they need to be. We have made the decision not to do more than what we are currently doing because we run the kind of trade-off between how much incremental volume could we do relative to the increase in incentives and the math frankly just doesn\u2019t work. So, we like the way we are running the business. We are running enough production through the machine for us to keep our trades and are pricing where it is and we will continue to look at the business the way that I think we always have and if things change we will react to that both to the positive and to the negative.  So, that\u2019s probably the best thing to do in terms of summing it up for you in terms of incentives and how we look at it. Operator : We will take our next question from Jack Micenko with SIG. Jack Micenko : Good morning. First question for Bob, help us understand where some of the financing incentives, buy downs and rate locks, where does that look in the income statement? Is that going be seen in margin, G&A or in the financial service line item? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: In gross margin, Jack Jack Micenko : Okay, okay, great. And then, 77% capture rate you got a good insight into most of your customers. When you look at the mortgage data in the last quarter or two, is it a DTI issue or is a sediment issue, what I mean by that is, are we bumping against DTI caps? Is there room to afford more and we just are uncomfortable or we are reading the news or whatever it is, or is the math just getting harder to work? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Are you looking at that from our perspective or the consumer, Jack? Jack Micenko : In entry-level, can you hear me? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, sorry. I think from the consumer standpoint, certainly affordability has gotten challenged the QM rules and the DTI limitations really do apply and so especially if you are at the lower price points, I think that\u2019s where you are going. It\u2019s getting more challenging for them. It\u2019s interesting though, I mean, if you look at our data and our average FICO this quarter was 752 again. So there is qualified buyers out there.  And I think everybody is now lending against the edges of the qualified mortgage rules. And so, what we are seeing is actually a very, very competitive market. And so, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s certainly not credit availability, but it\u2019s an issue and so for the consumer it\u2019s just looking for ways to pay. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Jack, the one thing that I would tell you is, we saw a little bit of a tick up in the use of arms in the quarter which I think would speak to the overall affordability pinch that we\u2019ve been talking about as consumers are looking for ways to make the available dollars stretch a little bit further to cover the payment.  But, I agree with Bob that the LTVs that we see out of the mortgage company that\u2019s been stable and really hasn\u2019t changed at all the FICO scores have been over 750 for ever. So, it\u2019s a qualified group and I generally agree that we are probably getting closer to the edges on what consumers can actually afford within the credit box or underwriting.  I think it\u2019s as much as anything mentally buyers have decided, they don\u2019t want to afford based on the negative headlines and some of the other things that we are seeing play out on the overall economy. Operator : We'll take our next question from Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Stephen East : Thank you, and good morning guys. If we \u2013 if you look at your cash, $1.1 billion, a big number, a couple of things there, one, what level are you all comfortable running at? I assume it\u2019s significantly lower than that and if you look at your excess cash after investing in your business, what would be as you look through 2019, your first priority, second priority thinking about buybacks, I mean, you can buyback a very large percentage of your shares outstanding if you decide to do that. But I don\u2019t know how M&A works into that, any debt repurchase et cetera? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, maybe I\u2019ll just \u2013 at a high level and then Bob maybe just chime in on the back-end. We are \u2013 in terms of capital allocation and where we are going, we are not changing on that all. Number one priority is to invest into the business and I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about that over time. M&A is including for us anyway as an investment into our business.  We see that the same as organic investment into a land pipeline. We are paying our dividend. You saw at the end of \u2013 at the end of the year we increased our dividend for 2019. We announced that middle of December last year and then third priority is that we will take excess capital that we don\u2019t invest in the business and we\u2019ll use that to buy shares. So, the overall focus of how we are using cash and allocating capital, no changes there. And then, I\u2019ll let Bob speak to some of the cash questions that you have. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, well, certainly, Stephen, we are pleased with the cash generation. We actually exceeded our expectations this year with $1.4 billion of cash flow. It has put us in a position having a pretty significant cash position and we are comfortable with that to be perfectly honest with you. Certainly, as Ryan laid out, our capital approach hasn\u2019t changed.  I think the only thing I would to what Ryan talked about is, we would think about leverage as part of that. We\u2019ve talked about that before in terms of the near-term maturities. We don\u2019t have any maturity stack until 2021. So I would tell you that we also think that given the volatility of the existing market that having some cash on the balance sheet to be opportunistic wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea. And so, as we sit here today, we will do exactly as Ryan laid out. We will think about leverage. But if there is some dislocation in the market, we think we can be opportunistic. We haven\u2019t seen the land values change much, but if they did, we want to be thinking about that as what we are going to do investing in the business as Ryan said, that\u2019s our first priority. Operator : We'll take a question from Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Susan Maklari : Thank you. My first question is just around some of the costs that you are seeing some of the pressures there. I know that, lumber should be sort of a tailwind as we get to the second half of the year. But can you talk to maybe what you are seeing in terms of the labor side? Did that improve any? Or have you seen any changes, especially maybe with some of the uncertainty in the market? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Susan, I think, we didn\u2019t highlight it, but we see a relatively benign on a relative basis the prior year cost environment. Certainly, lumber what we\u2019re flowing through the income statement is a little bit high. We have to reflect the spike in pricing last year, but to your point, we think that will be a benefit.  Outside of that or I guess, even including that, our expectation is probably for input cost, labor materials, probably about a 2% increase in 2019 versus 2018. And labor, I think the way we would characterize it as, it\u2019s not getting worse. We\u2019ve certainly \u2013 as the market has gotten a little bit choppier, we\u2019ve been out talking to our trade with that opportunities for us to be more efficient to help them to be more cost-effective for us.  That\u2019s going to be market-by-market depending on how much activity is going on, what the trade capacity is. But I would tell you, we see that as being less impactful in terms of an increase in 2019 than we have for the last couple of years. Susan Maklari : Okay. And then, my next question is just as we think about some of the regional trends that you talk to not just for the fourth quarter, but even sort of for more broadly 2018, they are somewhat reflective of sort of these broader kind of population shifts and some of the bigger sort of trends that we\u2019ve been seeing.  How do you think about your geographic footprint over the long-term? Is there anything that we should expect might change just over the course of time? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Susan, I wouldn\u2019t suggest that there is anything major coming in terms of our geographic focus. We\u2019ve long been the most geographically diverse builder and I\u2019d think that you will continue to see us play in most major markets. Certainly, the southern states, southwest and southeast and Texas or places where migratory patterns would suggest that there is a higher propensity of new jobs being created there as well as consumers and buyers relocating there whether it\u2019s for jobs or quality of life or both. I think you will continue to see us make investments in those places.  That being said, we still have a business in the northeast that we like. This last quarter was a bit tougher, similar commentary around the Midwest. So, we\u2019ll continue to look to see where population growth is occurring and where jobs are being created. Those are certainly two of the big drivers of housing demand and we\u2019d want to be positioned in such way that we take advantage of it. Operator : We\u2019ll take a follow-up question from Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Stephen East : Thank you. I appreciate the quick follow-up. If we look at our land \u2013 no problem, if we look at the vintage of land, your Del Webb or big communities fairly old, I am trying to understand your business mix. What type of vintage are you running through Del Webb right now? And then, as you reactivate the Centex brand are you also \u2013 is that primarily new land purchases or are those more legacy purchases from years ago? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, I'll answer the second question first, which is these are new land purchases. We do not have any significant dated assets that we are re-energizing or opening today. And then, with respect to Del Webb, we have five or six of the big communities as the same ones we\u2019ve had for years and we\u2019ll have for years coming. Other than that, that book is turning over on average I\u2019ll reported five years.  The underwriting for most of the deals we are doing now is somewhere in that four to five year range. So we are cycling through those communities that are little bit longer that are non-age restricted, but not much. Operator : At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer for any additional or closing remarks. James Zeumer : Great. Sorry that we\u2019ve run out of time. But we will certainly be available if you've got any questions over the course of the day. We look forward to speaking with you later on and otherwise, we will talk to you on our next earnings call. Thanks for your time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2019 PulteGroup Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Jack. We appreciate everyone joining this morning\u2019s call to discuss PulteGroup\u2019s first quarter financial results for the period ended March 31, 2019. Joining me for the call today are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of this morning\u2019s earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today\u2019s call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We\u2019ll also post an audio replay of today\u2019s call a little later on today. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all participants that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about PulteGroup\u2019s future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Jim and good morning. It has been discussed extensively that market conditions in the back half of 2018 and particularly in the fourth quarter were challenging across the housing industry. We believe that affordability issues driven in part by sustain housing price increases over the last few years along with increasing mortgage rates last year cause homebuyers to become more cautious as 2018 progressed. The consensus was that buyer interest as measured by traffic to communities remain high, but the conversion of that traffic to sign purchase contract slowed. Given these conditions exiting 2018 there\u2019s been a lot of interest in how homebuyers have been behaving in this spring selling season of 2019. Before parsing a variety of data points at a high level, here\u2019s what I can tell you about the start of 2019 inclusive of the first few weeks in April. We are experiencing a very typical seasonal upswing and are generally encouraged by the level of buyer activity that we\u2019re seeing. Further with the strong economic backdrop and the recent decline in mortgage rates, there\u2019s every reason to believe that 2019 can be another good year for the housing industry. Overall, our first quarter results are consistent with an improving demand environment, reflective of the typical spring selling season, traffic increased on a sequential basis throughout the quarter with more consumers visiting our communities each month as the quarter progressed. More importantly, traffic into our communities, was also up each month over the same month last year both in absolute numbers and on a per community basis when adjusted for our higher community count. Absorption pace has also improved during the quarter, although they remain below last year\u2019s level. With that said, it is worth noting that we experienced a very strong start to 2018. So the year-over-year comps are more challenging for the first half of this year. As a result, we are optimistic that the improving demand trends we experienced in the first quarter can continue and look forward to momentum building across \u2013 building this 2019 progresses. The past 15 months serve as a clear reminder that we operate in an industry that is cyclical seasonal and at times volatile. At the start of 2018 industry forecasts we\u2019re calling for another year of double-digit growth. By the end of the year, some were calling at the end of this housing cycle and predicting 2019 could see total industry volumes fall. Now, one quarter into 2019 and roughly 70 basis points lower on mortgage rates over the past 5 months, expectations are changing yet again, with some calling for a re-acceleration of housing demand. Given the changeable market dynamics within our organization, we have stress the need to remain disciplined in how we run our business. Stay focused on our key drivers and performance metrics. Take a balanced approach to the markets and buyers, we serve and continue allocating capital and alignment with our stated priorities. Central to being disciplined focused and balanced is making sure that we are offering product that is meeting the needs of consumers we are seeking to serve. Consistent with this view, I have talked about wanting our operations to be indexed to the local market opportunity and generally more balanced across buyer groups. In the first quarter, our orders were 30% first-time buyers, 46% move up buyers and 24% active adults. Adjusting the future mix of buyers requires that we first assemble the needed lots, which is exactly what we are doing. At the end of Q1 our lot pipeline consisted of 35% targeted for first-time, 30% for move up and 35% for active adult communities. Our closing mix won\u2019t match these percentages exactly, but it does show how our business should evolve to be more balanced over the next couple of years. Certainly our transition to a larger percentage of lower priced first time buyer lots and the recent decline in mortgage rates can help solve some of the affordability challenges that today\u2019s homebuyers are facing. However, our real opportunity lies in lowering house costs, not just for first-time buyers, but across our entire planned portfolio. To that end, we are utilizing our common plan, value engineering and should costing processes to help identify areas and opportunities to lower our build costs. We are also advancing initiatives that are looking at everything from basic floor plan designs and associated onsite and offsite build processes to option offerings, and go-to-market strategies. I think we\u2019ve done well with these activities in the past, but remain focused on finding ways to improve in all of these areas in the future. Relative to our plans and expectations for the year, Q1 results have us off to a good start and I like our overall competitive position. We have an appropriate inventory of homes and building lots to meet demand, but we\u2019re not inventory heavy and feeling pressure to move units. As Bob will detail, we continue to realize superior gross margins as we manage each community to deliver high returns. Before turning the call over to Bob, I want to draw everyone\u2019s attention to a press release issued several weeks ago announcing that we promoted John Chadwick to be PulteGroup\u2019s new Chief Operating Officer. John replaces Harman Smith, who had announced his plans to retire after an exceptional 29-year career with the company. John has also had an amazing career with PulteGroup, having spent the past 28 years serving in key roles within our organization. John has proven himself to be an outstanding leader and a highly skilled homebuilding operator. He has led some of our largest and most complex operations, including his most recent role as Area President for our West operations, which accounted for almost 40% of our pre-tax income in 2018. As you would expect from someone who has spent three decades inside our culture, John has a deep commitment to our construction quality and to delivering an outstanding home buying experience to our customers. I want to welcome John to the corporate office and thank Harmon Smith for his years of service and passion and commitment to our company\u2019s success. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Bob? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. PulteGroup\u2019s first quarter results were generally in line with or even slightly better than our guidance for the period as the company\u2019s operations continue to successfully execute their business plan. I would like to note that part of our comments, I will be providing guidance on our expected Q2 performance. We want to see how the spring selling season progresses from here and we\u2019ll be prepared to provide full-year guidance on our next earnings call. Let me now begin my detailed review of our first quarter results. Net new orders for the first quarter totaled 6,463 homes valued at $2.7 billion, which are down 6% and 5% respectively, compared with the first quarter of last year. As Ryan noted, buyer traffic was high in the quarter, but conversion rates remained slow. As a result, orders in the first quarter were lower across each of our buyer groups. For the quarter, first-time orders were down 1% to 1,956 homes. Move up, was down 11% to 2,946 homes and active adult was down 2% to 1,561 homes. Adjusting these figures for the 2% increase in our year-over-year community count resulted an 8% decline in absorption pace for the quarter. Absorption pace by buyer group was as follows : first time was down 10%, move-up was down 8% and active adult was down 7%. Moving to our income statement, home sale revenues increased by 2% to $1.9 billion. Q1 closings of 4,635 homes is up slightly over last year and ahead of our prior guidance as our operation successfully manage their build cycles. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven primarily by 2% or $8,000 increase in average sales price to $421,000. The increase in our average sales price was driven by higher prices among first-time buyers up 10% to $351,000 and active adults up 2% to $391,000. Move-up by our pricing for this quarter was down approximately 1% to $476,000. For the first quarter, our closings by buyer group included 25% from first-time buyers, 47% from move-up buyers and 28% from active adult buyers. Last year, our first quarter closings included 28% first-time, 48% move-up and 24% active adult. At the end of Q1, we had approximately 10,300 homes under construction of which just under 31% were spec. This compares to more than 34% of our homes under construction being spec in the fourth quarter of last year. Consistent with comments given on our fourth quarter call, we are tapering spec starts after having made the strategic decision to start more spec homes for production reasons in Q4 of last year. Given the volume of homes currently under production, we expect deliveries in the second quarter to be in the range of 5,400 homes to 5,700 homes. At the end of the quarter, the average sales price of our homes in backlog was $438,000. Given our backlog pricing, we expect our average sales price per homes we will deliver in the second quarter to be in the range of $430,000 to $435,000. This compares with an average sales price of $427,000 in the second quarter of last year. Our first quarter gross margin was 23.4% compared with 23.6% in the first quarter of last year. As discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, higher capitalized interest expense in 2019 impacted our gross margins by approximately 20 basis points. Our gross margin came in above prior guidance of the quarter benefited from a better geographic mix of homes closed as well as the continued execution of our strategic pricing programs. The success of our efforts can be seen in our unit pricing dynamics. For the first quarter, option revenues and lot premiums increased just over 4% compared with our first quarter last year to approximately $81,000 per closing. This increase was able to offset much of the increase in sales discounts for the quarter, which totaled $17,600 or 4% of sales price. On a year-over-year basis, sales discounts were up 80 basis points. While buyer interest remains high, the overall pricing environment is more challenging than this time last year. We worked to maximize returns in each community, which means we were prepared to adjust price lower or higher as appropriate. Given current market dynamics, we expect gross margin in the second quarter to be in the range of 22.8% to 23.3%. Working down the income statement, SG&A spend in the quarter was $253 million or 13% of home sale revenues, which is slightly better than our guidance, given large part to the increase in our closings compared to our guidance. Relative to last year, our overhead leverage declined by approximately 40 basis points at slightly higher commission, insurance-based cost and compensation impacts this quarter. We continue to keep a close eye on expenditures and look for opportunities to reduce overhead costs. With expectations for Q2 closing to be below last year, we will again lose some overhead leverage as we currently project that our SG&A will be between 11% and 11.5% of home sale revenues. In the first quarter, our financial services business generated pretax income of $12 million compared with $14 million in the prior year. Our capture rate in the quarter increased 2 percentage points to 80%, profitability was negatively impacted by the competitive pricing environment that continues to exist in the mortgage space. As a result, our pretax income for the quarter was $217 million, which compares to $224 million last year. Looking at our taxes, our reported income tax expense for the first quarter was $50 million. This represents an effective tax rate of 23%, which compares to 23.8% last year. Our Q1 tax rate was below our guidance as we recorded benefits related to equity compensation and the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters. Consistent with our first quarter guide, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25.3% in Q2. Finally, our net income for the first quarter was $167 million, which compares with $171 million last year, as $0.59 per share are earnings were consistent with last year. Our diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of this year was calculated using approximately 279 million shares, which is a decrease of more than 9 million shares or just over 3% from last year. The lower share count is due primarily to share repurchase activities executed over the past 12 months. During the first quarter of this year, we repurchased approximately 900,000 shares for $25 million or an average price of $27.16 per share. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1.1 billion of cash and the debt-to-capital ratio of 38%, which is down from 42% last year. Adjusting for cash on the balance sheet, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 28%. Let me close out my comments with a few operating metrics. For the quarter, we operate from 858 communities, which is up 2% from last year. Our community count for \u2013 guide for the year and the quarters continues to be that we will be roughly flat on a year-over-year basis in each quarter. Any variation from that, as we experienced in the first quarter will likely reflect the slower close out of existing communities rather than an acceleration in new community openings. Land acquisition spend for the quarter totaled $305 million, which is up about $15 million from last year. In the quarter, we put just over 4,000 lots under control, of which 54% had some form of option component. We continue to focus on smaller, faster turning communities as the average project size was 120 lots. Having said that, we expect to complete a larger scale deal with American West in the Las Vegas market, under the terms of this transaction, we will put approximately 3,600 lots under control of which approximately 1,200 finished lots will be acquired in the 11 communities with the remaining 2,400 lots being controlled via options. While we are not providing the terms of the transaction, I would note that we projected the owned lots represents less than two years of supply, based on current paces, and then we expect to realize our first closings from these communities in the first quarter of 2020. Together with our existing business and related investments we\u2019ve been making in the market, this transaction will enable us to dramatically increase our local market share in Las Vegas, beginning in 2020. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 149,000 lots under control of which 90,600 or 61% were owned with an additional 58,000 or 39% held via option. Based on our trailing 12 months of closings, we own roughly 3.9 years of land. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments on market conditions. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. At the risk of repeating comments that I made at the outset of our prepared remarks, I will provide some regional color, before we open the call to Q&A. Across the eastern third of the country, demand conditions were generally challenging in the quarter for a number of our markets. On a relative basis, Florida continues to be among the stronger areas of the country. In the middle third of the country, demand conditions actually held up pretty well where Texas showing the best year-over-year growth of our reporting areas. And in our western operations, we continue to see meaningful variation in market performance with the ongoing strength in Arizona, helping to offset slower demand in California. Again at a high level, I would say that the overall operating environment feels much better than what we experienced in the back half of 2018. We are optimistic the 2019 can turnout to be a good year for the housing industry with demand supported by strong jobs and historic lows and unemployment, which is allowing for some wage inflation and continued high consumer confidence. With mortgage rates, expected to stay low, the overall operating environment remains favorable. Let me close by saying thank you to our employees and our trade partners, who continue to do an outstanding job building great homes and delivering a superior experience to our customers. Jim. Jim Zeumer : Great, thank you, Ryan. I apologize for any back ground noise, maybe picking up as they decided today would be a good day to do some work on the adjacent elevators, I apologize for that. With that said, we will open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of the call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Jack will explain the process and we\u2019ll get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mike Dahl : Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Ryan, I wanted to follow-up just with a question about the improvement that you\u2019re talking about and just curious, you\u2019ve given the comments around absorption remaining lower but improving through the quarter, can you give us any sense of quantification from a monthly standpoint? And any color on April so far? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, really not a whole bunch more than I can add other than what I think we shared with you in our prepared remarks. But we\u2019re seeing the typical spring selling season where things have continued to get better as we move from January to February, February into March. Traffic has been strong, both year-over-year but also on a sequential basis. So we\u2019re very pleased with that. I think some of the stability that we\u2019ve seen and really the decline in mortgage rates, I highlighted in my prepared remarks that it\u2019s been 70 basis points over the last five or so months. I think all those things are helping to create an environment where we\u2019re optimistic about what we see for 2019. As I mentioned, we had a tough comp relative to the first quarter of 2018. It was really a spectacular time for the company and the industry. So as we look at how we\u2019re positioned, we like where our communities are out. We like the investments that we\u2019ve made. I think our team is operating very well. We\u2019re competing favorably in the eyes of the consumer. So that\u2019s part of the reason that we\u2019re optimistic about what we have in the coming year. Mike Dahl : Okay, encouraging to hear. And then my second question relates to gross margins it\u2019s clearly some real strength there even with respect to your prior guidance, could you give us a sense of \u2013 I know from a regional standpoint, the West was stronger on deliveries and that typically carries a higher margin, can you give us a sense of kind of what was mix related versus what was kind of core strength and West discounting than you previously assumed in terms of breaking down that bridge versus the guide? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, it\u2019s Bob. And as always with margin mix matters and you\u2019ve highlighted, we tried to touch on it in the prepared remarks, certainly we were able to close more homes in California than we were expecting in the first quarter, which benefited the margin relative to our guide. Also if you look at the mix of business, it was a little bit richer with Del Webb than it had been in the prior year, which also benefits the margin on a relative basis. Yes. The other thing I think that that happened is, we came into the year a little bit heavier on spec. We\u2019ve talked about that in the fourth quarter and we sold those out, you can see, we\u2019re down to 31% and we did a little bit better on those outcomes, then we were forecasting. So we didn\u2019t discount quite as much. We highlighted that the discount rate was up about 80 basis points, which is just under $4,000. But at the same time, our lot premium and option revenue was up almost that equivalent amount. And so I would tell you, we did little better on the spec sales than we thought which also benefited our margin relative to the guide at beginning of the quarter. Operator : You\u2019re next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Stephen Kim : Yes. Thanks very much guys. So it\u2019s just taking on that comment about how you did better on your temporary spec program then you may be expected. That is something that we were kind of looking for and I was curious as to whether or not there, there\u2019s any lessons learned from that in \u2013 if you were to experience another period in the future of rate volatility, let\u2019s say, would you be inclined to pursue a more aggressive spec posture then you historically or normally would. In light of the success, you\u2019ve had in the past in this most recent quarter. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Stephen. I think it\u2019s important to remember, we didn\u2019t see that the margins were higher on those specs sales, just higher than we expected, coming into the quarter. And so we continue to believe that there is value in having some inventory on the ground. We\u2019ve got less than one finished spec though and we\u2019ve highlighted that over time. And so we don\u2019t want a bunch of standing inventory around. So I think at the end of it, we are opportunistic because we want to keep the production line running at the back half of the year relative to the sales environment than \u2013 but I think you can and should expect to see us drive that spec percentage back down into that high 20s or leave it where it is today, it depends on the sales environment over the next four to eight weeks. But again, I think the \u2013 we focus on return and getting those homes sold before they finish is important to us. Stephen Kim : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s fine. And then secondly, I was curious if you could talk a little bit about the absorptions, obviously all communities are not created equal and just base, when you look at the mix of communities that you\u2019re likely to have in 2Q, would it be reasonable for us to expect that absorptions on a year-over-year basis, in the comp also get a little bit easier, might be able to be flat to up on a year-over-year basis. Is that kind of what you\u2019re expecting with the absorptions are? Are you anticipating that absorption will continue to be negative trending until you get to the back half of the year? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, it\u2019s a challenge for us to guide to absorption. We haven\u2019t done it Stephen candidly. And so I think, we\u2019ll see how the selling environment goes. Yes, we saw a tapering in sales after April of last year. And so sales remain strong on a relative basis, you can see it flat. Again, it\u2019s going to depend on how the sales season goes. Stephen Kim : Okay, great. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Alan Ratner : Hi, good morning, nice quarter. So on the gross margin very strong result this quarter, the guidance seems like you\u2019re expecting maybe a little bit of sequential pressure in 2Q. But obviously still well above what you \u2013 thought you were going to hit this quarter. You know just kind of moving the moving pieces around here on the mix and cost and price. Can you just talk a little bit about what goes into your 2Q guide, is that any unwind from that mix benefit you saw this quarter? Or is this kind of where you see the price versus cost dynamic currently meaning costs that are still going up at a low single-digit rate and pricing power? Is pretty tepid, which results in that type of sequential pressure? Ryan Marshall : Go ahead. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Alan, important to remember we\u2019re still near 23%. So the margin profile is pretty strong, but the market is challenging right now. Price is a little bit harder to come by, we have a lot of companies that have much more inventory on the ground that they\u2019re trying to work through. And so we are working \u2013 we\u2019ve highlighted in the prepared remarks, we are interested in selling homes. And so we\u2019re willing to toggle price to do that to a degree, also mix does matter, you highlighted that we \u2013 and we highlighted that we pulled some closings are we\u2019re able to close homes in California. So on a relative basis, we\u2019ll have less of those higher margin closings in Q2 than we did in Q1, which will matter. And then the relative percentage between the active adult and the traditional business made moderate a little bit. And so we\u2019re candidly pretty pleased with the margins that we\u2019re expecting for the second quarter. And again, it is reflective of the fact that the market is a little challenging right now for price. Alan Ratner : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Yes, on that certainly the absolute margins are very strong. I just wanted to better understand kind of what went into your thought process there. Second, just a couple of housekeeping questions on the American West deal if I could, it sounds like there is no active communities or backlog that\u2019s coming over. I just wanted to confirm that. That\u2019s correct, because you\u2019re not anticipating deliveries until 2020. And then I guess the follow-up there is why was this the right deal, why Las Vegas? Is there something specific about that lot position or their price point positioning there that\u2019s attractive to you guys. And should we expect more of this type of deal going forward? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Alan, it\u2019s Ryan. Good morning. A couple of things there. First, with American West, we did acquire active communities. We did not acquire backlog. And so that\u2019s why we highlighted that will start closing homes in early 2020. Second \u2013 secondarily, to your second question, we like Las Vegas. We\u2019ve got a nice operation there. We\u2019ve \u2013 they have had a historic success in Vegas, we like the positioning of where these communities are located, they are in a very favorable part of town relative to the job core, the transportation network and so we like that. We like frankly, the value that these communities offered to consumers on a price per foot and what you get for the price, you\u2019re paying. We think American West is done a very nice job positioning these communities. And so that was attractive to us as well, maybe the third and fourth items that I\u2019d highlight we like what it does to our relative market share in Las Vegas, which is something that we\u2019ve highlighted is key to our success. And finally, we like the nature of how this transaction was constructed in that we get a little less than two years worth of owned lots, and we have a great pipeline of future lots that are under option. So kind of all things considered, we think it was a very good transaction, and we\u2019re excited to have the American West brand part of our family. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Ryan Marshall : Ken, good morning. Ken Zener : Hello, yes, can you hear me now? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Ken Zener : Excellent. So Ryan, Bob, I know you guys talked about orders \u2013 order pace being down year-over-year. We do look at it model it sequentially, you have a long history of pace going up about 40% sequentially in 1Q, you did about 50%, so higher than a standard deviation basically. Why don\u2019t -- when you talk about April, and I don\u2019t want to focus on a couple of weeks, but when did you really start to feel comfortable that these orders were coming through, was it really just March, A? And then B, how did that play out in the pricing dynamic you might have seen within the spec units that ended up coming better? And why did you deliver more in California? That\u2019s my only question here. Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Ken, in fairness, I think there were three embedded in there, but I\u2019ll answer all of them. First off, let me maybe speak to the California question, we\u2019ve got a great team in California that has done a nice job getting some complicated buildings built in a complicated and entitlement market and so some of that was just our own internal planning and assessing associated risks with getting those homes closed. So I think we did a nice job with that. The other two pieces \u2013 yes, in terms of kind of pricing and when we saw things start to really accelerate, we\u2019ve long said and maybe the industry has long said that Super Bowl tends to be kind of the time of the year when you start to see the spring selling season started to kick in. And I think that held true this year and then we continue to see things strengthen as we move throughout the quarter. So we\u2019re pleased with that, as far as kind of pricing power, I think I\u2019d point back to some of the things that Bob touched on, its competitive and there are some competitors out there that have put a lot of inventory on the ground and so consumers have choices. And within that environment, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re toggling associated discounts and incentives, such that we\u2019re getting our share of the buyers that are out there willing to buy. And I think we\u2019re as demonstrated by the absorptions in Q1, I think we struck the right balance between pace and price, where we\u2019ve got a healthy and attractive margin profile. But we also we are able to sell homes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nishu Sood : Thank you. Your balance sheet looks in great shape now with the cash flow generation of last year. Your net debt to cap sub 30, thinking about cash flow deployment this year, obviously the American West acquisition will consume some of it. How do you expect that kind of remainder of kind of cash flow to be allocated? Do you expect to keep up the pace of cash returns to shareholders through buybacks and dividends or with the American West acquisition either prevent that or maybe indicate additional acquisitions to come? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Nishu, it\u2019s Bob. Thank you, great question. I point you back to what we\u2019ve been saying for years now, which is no change to our capital allocation strategy or processes expect us first to invest in the business, we had guided to a $1 billion, $2 billion of land acquisition spend this year, which is about the same as we did last year. Obviously, that excludes American West so that, American West spend would be on top of that. And after that, we will certainly look at our capital in the same way we always have, we\u2019ll pay our dividend, we\u2019ll buy back stock, if we have excess, we\u2019ll look at our leverage and it makes sense. So nothing new to report there and nothing really -- we\u2019ve also told folks, as we\u2019ll tell you, when we\u2019ve done it as opposed to what we think we\u2019re going to do, so no guidance in terms of dollars spent on anything other than the land. Nishu Sood : Got it, got it. Okay, and on SG&A, the 11% to 11.5%, I believe you mentioned for 2Q, there were some modest deleveraging in 1Q, and I know that closings will be down a little more year-over-year, but it seems like more significant deleveraging than what we saw in 1Q. Are there any one-off factors that are driving that? Or how should we think about the kind of acceleration in the SG&A deleveraging in 2Q 2019? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, I think it\u2019s really -- there are no kind of unique aspects to that other than our expense structure typically comes pretty ratably whereas the closings can be a little lumpy, for lack of a better word and so relative to our guide in the first quarter, we closed warehouses that we thought would close in the second quarter. And so really it was a little bit of a pull forward of revenue into Q1. So Q2, the spend is still there, but some of the revenue dollars came in Q1. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Lovallo : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. The first one on Texas was a bright spot versus our expectations. Can you give us an idea of what kind of areas, you saw the most strength, perhaps the receptivity to send tax and may be opportunities for Centex to rollout into other markets? Ryan Marshall : Yes, John, it\u2019s Ryan. Texas was a bright spot for us, we\u2019re in all four major cities in Texas, Austin, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio. I would tell you that all four cities performed well of the four, Austin is arguably the strongest and I think that\u2019s really being driven by the continued job creation and high quality jobs that are being created in Austin, which is feeling further housing need. Second to Austin, I\u2019d highlight Houston, our senior team Bob and I, we were just in the Texas markets a couple of weeks ago. So we saw at first hand there is some nice things going on economically in Houston as well. And I think you\u2019re continuing to see that city really get back on its feet following the flooding and the hurricanes that they experienced a year and a half ago. And then Dallas also very strong, but it has seen a run-up in pricing, affordability has been certainly the affordability equation there is not as attractive as what it used to be. But lots of people there, good economy, jobs are being created. And then finally San Antonio is a stable kind of a steady as she goes market and we really like the business that we\u2019re seeing there. So, on the whole, Texas was a favorable bright spot for us as you highlighted. John Lovallo : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the cost side, did you guys benefit from number in the quarter? And then is there any update on just kind of trade labor in general, if you\u2019re seeing any loosening there or about the same? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, certainly lumber was a little bit of benefit in Q1 as we had highlighted on our fourth quarter call that will be more of a Q2 and Q3 issue for us. Important to remember that lumber is only 3% to 5% of the total vertical construction costs, so it\u2019s \u2013 well, it will benefit us. It\u2019s not a \u2013 an overly significant element of the house construction cost, labor is obviously one of the larger ones. And we had highlighted coming into the year roughly a 2% increase or expectation for increase in our material and labor input costs. And we still see that is the case for the balance of the year. So, yes, that\u2019s with the relative save on lumber later in the year. So not really aggressive pricing environment, and obviously we\u2019ve got our teams working to try and drive those costs down, labor being one of the areas we\u2019re looking at. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Hi. Thanks, good morning, everyone. The first question I had was on trends during the quarter, because appreciate you giving the 2Q guidance, but at the same time you held off on the full-year guidance, I guess, wanting to see more of how the spring came together or it will continue to come together. And so it kind of implied a little bit of a question mark as we close things out. I was just curious if that was the result of any type of continued volatility, let\u2019s say, month to month during the quarter, because you\u2019ve obviously indicated that it seems like things kind of progressed in somewhat more of an orderly pace with traffic improving every month even up year-over-year. And it seems like you had some amount of \u2013 I don\u2019t know stability is the right word. But you know kind of a decent cadence, so I\u2019d love to get color on your sales pace, I believe, was down 8% on average for the quarter itself. Was there volatility on a year-over-year basis as we progressed January, February, March? If there be any color around that sales pace metric in particular or any other areas of volatility that you might want to highlight, that would be helpful. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike. It\u2019s Ryan. I think I\u2019ll point back to some of the comments or reiterate some of the comments I made in the prepared remarks. We saw the quarter really play out where each month got stronger, both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. As we highlighted the absorption rates were still down relative to Q1, but that was as much reflective of a very strong 2018. No intra-quarter volatility that I would point to. We\u2019ve given our guide for Q2, we\u2019ve highlighted that we\u2019ll give you our full-year guide at the end of Q2. The one thing that I would probably highlight note for you is that last year, it was kind of the 3rd quarter of April, 4th quarter of April when we started to see a slowdown. And we talked about that on our Q2 call last year. So that\u2019s probably the one thing that we\u2019re continuing to kind of watch and pay attention to. In addition to that, as both Bob and I have mentioned, it\u2019s still competitive out there. So we like how the market is performing. But there is some inventory, there is some discounting going on. And so for those reasons, we\u2019ve elected to wait until the end of Q2. Michael Rehaut : Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess just to clarify, when you see improvement throughout the quarter. If that applies to the sales pace improving on a year-over-year basis as well. If I can just get that clarification. And then just going back to American West for a second, I believe there are currently operating around a dozen communities. Just wanted to get that right. And the closings number, at least from 2017 as Builder Magazine has it was a little over 600, if we\u2019re talking about that type of scale in terms of how you think about, what they could contribute on an annualized basis. Ryan Marshall : Yes, 11 active communities, Mike is what we plan to have there. And as we mentioned, we will see closings in 2020 is when we\u2019ll start to see things from that business. In terms of kind of your question on what do we see as we move through the quarter, we were down in absorption rates year-over-year. So there was a decline, but things got stronger as we move through the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Your line is open. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about pricing power or what there is or lack of incentive just among the different product types. So I think we have a sense of it from a geographic standpoint. But if you compare active adult move up and first-time in the mix. Ryan, where are you seeing the best performance in terms of lack of incentives or perhaps pricing power. Ryan Marshall : Well, Carl, I think we\u2019d continue to highlight that the best performer for us is in active adult, that\u2019s a buyer group. A, that I think is as generally fared well economically in the current environment, they are not nearly as sensitive on interest rates as what the other two buyer groups are typically got an accumulation of wealth. And then we\u2019ve got a very compelling offering and unique offering with our Del Webb communities that we think is differentiated in the marketplace. And I think that gives us some pricing power. With the other two groups, I\u2019d probably characterize them as equal in terms of discounting but for different reasons. The move-up buyer that has got choice and there\u2019s generally speaking more inventory on the ground for that buyer to choose from. So I think that\u2019s a driver for added incentives. And with the first time entry level buyer there is more of an affordability pinch there, that is creating the need for incentives. So best active adult, the other two probably being equal. Carl Reichardt : Great. Thanks, Ryan. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open. Matthew Bouley : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on the comments you made around spec margins. Specifically, to what degree would you say that the higher spec you carried into the quarter played into that 4% sales discount you disclose the up 80 basis points year-over-year. And so as you started to now normalize the spec position what would be the implication to incentives, I guess going forward. Thank you. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, I don\u2019t think we have that level of granularity for you today. The thing I\u2019d highlight for you is over time what we have seen is the margins that we realized on homes and I think discount as being part of this, if we sell it as 3rd or if we sell it before, basically frame are roughly the same. Even if it was started a spec, where we start to see degradation in margin is when we get them final. And so as you can tell, we don\u2019t have a ton of final inventory on the ground, it was 662 I think finished back at the end of the quarter, which is up maybe 50 or 60 over last year. So we didn\u2019t let a lot of it get to that. And so I would tell you it\u2019s probably not a significant driver in answering your question, it\u2019s is not a significant driver, the discount differential on spec versus non-spec production. Matthew Bouley : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly just bigger picture on the land spend comments. You grew your land spend in the quarter, but it sounds like you\u2019re keeping the 2019 guidance around $1.2 billion before American West. So just given the market has improved since that initial guidance. I mean would there be any kind of rethinking or perhaps upside to that land spend target? What are your thoughts around I guess ongoing unit growth targets at this stage in the cycle? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes. At this point in time, we\u2019re not given any kind of additional guide beyond the $1.2 billion that we\u2019ve highlighted. But I would note that essentially, the American West transaction is an investment in land, 1,200 or so finished lots that will get today and another 2,400 plus or minus option lots. So, those are incremental lots beyond the guy that we had initially given and will also be incremental spend. So I think I would read into that we are optimistic and bullish on the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Susan. Susan Maklari : My first question is around Del Webb. You definitely saw some more strength in that part of the business this quarter and it\u2019s an area where you\u2019ve done a lot of work over the last call it year or two. And sort of repositioning or redesigning those communities to some extent. So how much of the strength this quarter, would you attribute to the company\u2019s specific efforts versus just the broader market and the shift in demand? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Susan, I think it\u2019s probably broader than just say in the last year and a half. This is an effort that really goes back to when we rolled out our very first commonly manage plans, which happened to be specifically designed for our Del Webb communities. That work goes back to kind of end of 2013, 2014 timeframe. We\u2019ve highlighted that we are now five years after that initial roll-out. We\u2019re in the process of rolling out our next generation Del Webb plans. So we think we\u2019ve done a really nice job with the product meeting the needs of this particular buyer, I think some of the things that you were alluding to are reflective of smaller communities. And when I say smaller, these are on the order of 750 to 1,200 units, relative to some of the larger size Del Webb communities that we had from a prior timeframe where they could be as large as 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 homes in size and scale. So I think it\u2019s a combination of how the brand has continued to evolve to keep up with how that buyer has evolved. The communities are a little smaller and that\u2019s really being driven by a desire for these buyers to work longer, have access to the amenities, the country clubs, the churches, the entertainment that they\u2019re used to and their current market as opposed to selling their family home and moving out of state to an entirely different destinations. So hard to pinpoint it down to a timeframe of the last six, 12 or 18 months, but it\u2019s really been an evolution over the last six to seven years. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thank you. And then my next question is just, you talked a little bit to the strength that you did see in terms of some of the options in the lot premiums in the quarter. Is there any sort of change you would say that you\u2019ve seen there in terms of what people are choosing or any preference over one thing versus another that you could share with us? Ryan Marshall : Nothing that I would highlight other than we think the way that we are running our pricing model. We\u2019re doing a nice job of giving consumers choice and allowing them to spend money on the things that they value. Lot premiums continue to be something that we get great benefit out of and we think the consumer does as well. Unique lot premiums there are typically only a small number of those in a given community. And so, if a buyer has an opportunity to buy those, there are certainly value for the consumer and for us as we sell those. Option spend, we continue to see probably some of the most popular things be the personal choice items around flooring, around cabinets, counter-tops some structural options as consumers kind of customize or personalize the things that they want in their home. Those are the things where we\u2019re seeing buyer spend money. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG. Your line is open. Jack Micenko : Good morning. Ryan and Bob, I think you said that in terms of you are up about 80 basis points year-over-year. I\u2019m more curious if you could give us a sense of what incentives maybe get through the quarter. I know you said pricing, the pricing environment is still tough. But is there any directional sense or color you could give us on incentive trends and even maybe into April. Ryan Marshall : Jack nothing meaningful in terms of differential during the quarter candidly. Jack Micenko : Okay. And then on the land side, I think in the slide, call it a 54% option components and I think it\u2019s been in the \u201840s in prior years. So just can you give us an update around mix. I know you\u2019re still to three year number of working that down, but with 61% owned, but doing more option. Where do we see that number getting to inclusive of America West over the next year or two as you say? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: So I don\u2019t want to give a target, but the America West obviously 67% of the lots are controlled via option and the 1,200 that we bought, Ryan highlighted two years of supply their finished. Looking at the book, we have highlighted that were at 3.9 years, 39% controlled in total via option. But if you take out some of those legacy Del Webb positions you\u2019re closer to 3.3 years of owned and almost 50 :50 owned versus option. So I think there are opportunities. But not significant movement from here. I think if you look back the last four or five years, we\u2019ve been operating at close to that three years owned and three years options, I think you continued \u2013 you will continue to see that from us going forward. Obviously American West is an opportunity that was allowed us to do little bit better than that. And we\u2019ll seek other opportunities as we go forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Przybylski with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Paul Przybylski : Thank you. Going back to Del Webb, did you see normal seasonality and orders this quarter? Or was there a later start to the selling season maybe some carry through into March and April, given the 4Q loss that buyer had? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Nothing that I would highlight Paul, it\u2019s unique or abnormal. Paul Przybylski : Okay. And then what percent of your communities had price increases versus peak? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: I don\u2019t know that Paul. We can try to do a little work for you. Paul Przybylski : Okay. All right. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to our presenters for closing remarks. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Jack. Appreciate everybody\u2019s time this morning. We\u2019re certainly available as the day goes along. For any additional questions and we will look forward to speaking with you on our next conference call. Operator : This concludes the Q1 2019 PulteGroup, Inc. earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference. Jim Zeumer : Thank you, Chris and good morning. I\u2019m pleased to welcome you to PulteGroup\u2019s conference call and webcast to review operating and financial results for our second quarter ended June 30, 2019. Here with me today are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of this morning\u2019s earnings release and the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We\u2019ll also post an audio replay of today\u2019s call to our website a little later today. We want to point out that PulteGroup\u2019s financial results for the second quarter of 2018 included several unusual items which were noted in our earnings release. As part of today\u2019s call, we will comment on our reported results, as well as our 2018 financial results adjusted to exclude the impact of these items. We\u2019ve provided reconciliation of these adjusted 2018 numbers to the reported results in our earnings release and within the webcast slides posted as part of this morning\u2019s call. We encourage you to review this information to assist in your analysis of our year-over-year Q2 results. Before I turn the call over to Ryan Marshall, let me remind everyone that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about PulteGroup\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Jim and good morning. I\u2019m excited to speak with you today about PulteGroup\u2019s second quarter results and I\u2019m pleased to say that on a seasonally adjusted basis, market conditions for the second quarter and the first six months of 2019 remained consistently stronger than what we experienced through the back half of 2018. Further based on feedback from our operators, I\u2019d tell you that the market generally felt stronger in Q2 than in Q1 with mortgage rates down roughly 75 basis points from the start of the year, it\u2019s easy to understand how market momentum continued to advance as the year progressed. Our second quarter performance reflects this momentum build as orders increased 7% over the last year. This is a notable swing after orders were lower in the first quarter of 2019 compared with Q1 of the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, orders were a little slow in April, but then we realized strong gains as the quarter progressed. While there are always a number of factors that influence the home buying decision, it is reasonable to assume the decline in interest rates had some impact in attracting additional buyers. As it relates to the current sales environment, I\u2019ll paraphrase my comments from our first quarter earnings call in saying that through the first six months of 2019, we\u2019ve experienced what we view as a typical seasonal recovery in buyer demand. It is great to see that consumer demand has been so resilient this year given the soft sales environment in the back half of 2018. I think that this characterization is consistent with the government data which show new home sales through the first five months of 2019 were up 4% over the comparable period last year. It is certainly nice to see the year-over-year increase, but as important we're not seeing signs of a pending fall-off in demand like the industry experienced starting towards the middle of last year. I'm not sure that lower rates will materially alter typical seasonal buying patterns, but we see no obvious signs of a replay of 2018's back half slowdown. In a couple of minutes, Bob will provide details on our second quarter operating results and our strong performance across key metrics including orders, closings, margins, EPS and returns. I want to take a moment however, to highlight that along with great financial performance, our second quarter offers a great example of PulteGroup continuing to execute its playbook. Operationally, we delivered against our objective to effectively balance price and pace to achieve high returns while taking every opportunity to drive ASPs, revenues and gross margins. We then allocated the resulting strong cash flows in alignment with our stated priorities. This included investing $857 million of land acquisition and development in the business including the American West transaction in the second quarter. As a reminder through the American West acquisition, we put 3,500 lots under control in Las Vegas. In addition to dramatically improving our size and scale in the Vegas market, the deal structure is extremely capital efficient as we purchased only one-third of the lots while controlling the other two-thirds via option. Along with investing in the growth of our business, we returned $114 million to shareholders in the second quarter through share repurchases and dividends bringing the total of our returns to shareholders to over a $170 million this year. I would also highlight that our Board approved a $500 million increase to our share repurchase authorization during the quarter. And finally, during the quarter we also completed a tender for $274 million of our senior notes that were scheduled to mature in 2021. This repurchase helped to lower the company's debt to capital ratio to 35% on a gross basis, which is well within our guidance range of 30% to 40%. Perhaps most importantly, the strong cash flows generated by our business allowed us to implement these actions and still in the quarter with more than $650 million of cash. I can tell you that in prior cycles, our capital allocation would have likely looked very different than this with most if not all available capital invested into the business. Our more balanced approach including a measured increase in land spend is consistent with our capital allocation priorities and with our view that this current housing cycle can continue to move higher. Now let me turn the call over to Bob. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks Ryan and good morning everyone. As Jim noted, our second quarter results in 2018 included several unusual items which impacted our reported numbers for that period. Where appropriate, I'll highlight these items and discuss reported as well as adjusted numbers to provide a clearer picture of our year-over-year performance. For the second quarter, we reported 6,792 net new orders which represent an increase of 7% over last year. Breaking down orders by buyer group shows first-time orders increased 30% to 2,099 homes. Move-up orders increased 3% to 3,043 homes while active adult orders were lower by 7% to 1,650 homes. For the quarter, we operated out at 877 communities, which is an increase of 3% over last year. Adjusting for community count, absorption pace and total was up 4% driven by increases of 14% and 5% respectively the first-time and move-up orders. Pace among active adult communities was down 13%. Specific to the second quarter, the lower pace among active adult communities reflects the closeout of several high volume neighborhoods in combination with replacements opening later in the quarter. More broadly, this buyer group is generally more cautious and appears to be rebounding at a slower pace following the weakness in the back half of 2018. I would like to point out that we realized approximately 100 signups from the 11 communities that we acquired in connection with the American West transaction that closed during the quarter. While we expect orders will continue to pace between 30 to 50 per months for the balance of the year from these assets, we don't expect to realize any closings related to American West until the first quarter of next year. In total, we currently expect to realize approximately 600 closings from the American West assets in 2020. Looking at our income statement, home sale revenues for the second quarter were down 2% to $2.4 billion. Revenues for the period reflected 1% increase in average sales price to $430,000 offset by a 3% decrease in closings to 5,589 homes. ASP and closing volumes for the quarter were both in line with company guidance. In the second quarter, ASPs of $364,000 and $486,000 for first-time and move-up buyers respectively were effectively flat with last year, while active adult pricing gained 6% to $411,000. The increase in average selling price with an active adult is due primarily to a change in the geographic mix of homes closed in the period. Closings by buyer group for the second quarter consisted of 30% first-time, 44% move-up and 26% active adult. In Q2 of last year, closings were 29% first time, 47% move-up, and 24% active adults. At the end of the second quarter, the company had a backlog of 11,793 homes under contract which is comparable with the prior year period. We also ended the quarter with 11,454 homes in production which is up 3% from last year. Of the homes currently being built, 8,528 or 74% are sold while the remaining 26% are spec. Consistent with comments provided on previous calls, spec production has come back into historical ranges following the strategic decision to allow specs to rise in the back half of 2018. Based on the current volume of homes under construction, we expect third quarter deliveries to be in the range of 5,700 to 6,000 homes. Further, we currently expect full year 2019 closings to be in the range of 22,300 to 22,800 homes. Given the average sales price for homes in backlog and pricing trends in the market, we expect our average sales price in closings for the remainder of the year to be in the range of $425,000 to $430,000. While we are seeing some opportunities to capture incremental price in the market, we also expect our mix of first time closings to increase slightly over the back half of the year which will influence our reported ASP. Company's second quarter gross margin was 23.1%, which is consistent with our previous guide. The lower margins compared with last year reflects higher land, labor and material cost as well as the more competitive market conditions that developed in the back half of 2018. While down slightly from last year, our gross margins continue to benefit from our strategic pricing program as a resulting gains in option revenues and lot premiums. For the second quarter option revenues and lot premiums increased 5.9% or $4,653 to $84,082 per home. On a year-over-year basis sales discounts for the quarter were up 80 basis points to 3.9% or $17,600 per home. It\u2019s worth highlighting that our higher option revenues and lot premium offset most of the increased we incurred in sales discount. I would also note that sequentially discounts in Q2 were flat on a dollar basis and down 10 basis points from the first quarter of this year. Well, market conditions generally remain competitive and incentives continue to be elevated, buyer demand has clearly improved from the end of 2018. Given these market dynamics, we expect gross margins to be relatively stable over the back half of 2019. We currently expect gross margins to be in the range of 22.8% to 23.3% for the third quarter. Based on our expectations for the balance of the year combined with our performance to the first two quarters of the year, we currently expect our gross margins for the full year to be in the range of 23% to 23.3%. SG&A expense in the second quarter was $259 million or 10.8% of home sale revenues. Reported SG&A expense of $226 million or 9.2% of home sale revenues in Q2 of last year included a pre-tax benefit of $38 million associated with insurance adjustments taken in the period. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 of last year was $264 million or 10.8% of home sale revenues. Based on our expectations for the balance of the year, combined with our performance to the first two quarters, we currently expect SG&A expense for the full year to be in the range of 10.8% to 11.3% of home sale revenues. In the quarter we realized net land sale gains of $1.4 million which compares the gains of $27 million in the comparable prior year period. I would highlight that last year's gains included $26 million from the sale of two bigger land parcels which generated unusually large profits. I would also note that this year second quarter results include a $4.8 million pre-tax charge related to costs associated with the successful tender for $274 million of our senior notes. This charge is reflected in other expenses on our income statement. In the second quarter our financial services business generated pre-tax income of $25 million which is an increase of 21% over last year. The gain and pre-tax income for the period was driven by higher volumes as capture rate increased along with higher profitability per loan. For the quarter, mortgage capture rate was 81% up from 76% last year. Income tax expense for the second quarter was $80 million which represents an effective tax rate of 24.9%, which is generally in line with prior guidance. Last year's reported income tax expense of $85 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 20.8% included $17 million of tax adjustments reported in the period. The adjusted tax rate for Q2, 2018 was 25%. Consistent with our previous guidance, we expect our tax rate in the third quarter to be approximately 25.3%. On the bottom line, the company generated second quarter net income of $241 million or $0.86 per share. In the prior year the company's reported net income was $324 million or $1.12 per share and on an adjusted basis net income last year was $259 million or $0.89 per share. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was calculated using approximately 278 million shares, which is a decrease of 9 million or 3% from Q2 of last year. The decrease in share count is due primarily to the company's ongoing share repurchase activities. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million common shares for $83 million for an average price of $31.82 per share. Through the first six months of the year we have repurchased 3.5 million shares for $108 million for an average cost of $30.61 per share. Inclusive of the $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization that our Board approved this quarter, we had $691 million remaining on our repurchase authorization at the end of the second quarter. Inclusive of our stock and debt purchases during the period we ended the quarter with $659 million of cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 35.1%. Net of our cash on hand our debt-to-capital ratio was 29.1%. As Ryan also mentioned, we have continued to invest in our business including the American West transaction that we closed during the quarter. In total we paid a $164 million for American West of which $136 million was ascribed to the land we acquired. The balance of the consideration was ascribed to moral homes and the American West trade name. Looking at our land acquisition activity in the quarter, we invested $473 million in the business which includes $136 million for American West. For the year, we have invested $778 million in land acquisition along with $735 in land development. With a little over $1.5 billion of total land related spend in the first half of the year we are on track to invest approximately $2.9 billion for the year which would be an increase of about 10% over 2018. And finally, at quarter end we controlled approximately 154,000 lots of which approximately 40% are controlled via option. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan for some final comments on market conditions. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Bob. As I said at the outset of this call, we experienced a meaningful improvement in our business with year-over-year orders up 7% in the quarter. The increase reflects improved order metrics across many of our markets and specifically looking at conditions across our regions I tell the following. The eastern third of the country continued to experience good demand with the southeast seeing a nice pickup in buyer activity, while Florida remained one of the top performing areas of the country. In the middle third of the country, Texas remained strong particularly in the Houston and Austin markets, but demand among the higher price points in the Midwest was a little bit slower in the quarter. And at West, Nevada inclusive of the new American West communities as well as our Arizona market enjoyed very strong demand. Business in California remained challenging, but conditions do seem to be stabilizing with buyers beginning to venture back into our communities. I would note that the improved level of buyer interest experienced in Q2 has carried into the first few weeks of July. The strong economy, low unemployment and falling interest rates continue to support the demand for new homes. Before opening the call for questions I do want to thank all PulteGroup employees for their tireless efforts to deliver a great home and customer experience to every homebuyer. I'm also proud to say that based on the feedback from our employees, PulteGroup was just certified as a great place to work. This is another important milestone as we work to demonstrate the strength of our corporate culture in an outstanding environment we seek to maintain. Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim? Jim Zeumer : Thank you, Ryan. We will now open the call to questions in contrary to the operator's comments they are open to all not just financial analysts so that we can speak with as many participants as possible though during the remaining time of the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Chris let's get the Q&A process started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mike Dahl : Thanks for taking my questions and nice results. Ryan Marshall : Thanks Mike. Mike Dahl : Ryan, I wanted to start out and dig in a little bit more on the active adult commentary. You mentioned that it just seems like it's taking a little bit longer for that buyer segment to rebound. I was hoping you could break it down even just anecdotally if you could between kind of some of the legacy, larger Dell Web projects and some of the kind of newer projects that might have kind of - the smaller footprints, more urban footprints and has there been any notable difference within that segment in terms of performance there? Ryan Marshall : Yes Mike. Great question and what I would tell you as we highlighted in some of our prepared remarks, we closed out of a number of our communities or suctions of communities that were generating relatively high sales paces. The replacement positions for those selling locations came on a little later in the quarter and had slightly lower sales pace and so the combination of those two things is really what had an impact on the comparative results. I would tell you there's not a differentiation in performance between the in town communities and some of the bigger larger legacy communities. They both perform well and on a relative basis year-over-year are very similar. More broadly Mike, just to kind of get into the question about the active adult buyer, I would tell you that these buyers are taking a little bit longer to regain some momentum coming out of the back half of last year. The group is, as I think most of you know, is less rate sensitive on both the upswing and the downswing. So the drop in interest rates doesn't have quite the same push that it does for other buyer groups. They frequently pay cash or take very small mortgages. I think it's also a buyer group that tends to be a little bit more cautious and so probably not a total surprise that it's been a tad bit slower than the other buyer groups. Mike Dahl : That's helpful. And then, I guess conversely had this really nice pickup in the first-time buyer and so I think part of that's clearly been some of the pivot that you've had towards that. But hoping you could elaborate a little more and forgive me if I missed this, but that 30% increase in orders for the first time. Help us understand, how much of that is coming from absorption versus the community count growth you've seen there and any other color you can give us around that? Thanks. Ryan Marshall : So Mike, I'll start with the absorption question. We had a 14% increase in absorption, so pretty meaningful increase there. Further you've heard us talk over the last really 18 to 24 months that we've been intentionally into that investing in the first time space and we've been bringing assets into our book of business that are specifically targeted for this buyer group, which we think is a meaningful differentiation between doing that which we have done and taking existing assets and simply repurposing them from something they are originally intended for into the first time space. So, we highlighted on our call last quarter that if you look at the lots that we control that are specifically targeted for the first time buyer group it's about 35% of our controlled book now. So you'll see this segment continue to have a more meaningful presence in our closing volume over time. So last thing maybe on that point Mike, just I highlighted absorptions were up 14% and community count was up 13%. So those are the two elements that contributed to the overall increase in first time. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much guys. I missed if you gave the community count guide, I was curious if you could talk to us about what your expectations are for community count and what the challenges and opportunities are on that metric specifically? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes Stephen, we didn't give a guide, but an answer to your question we expect the community count to be up between 1% and 3% in the third and fourth quarters relative to the prior year period. In terms of the challenges as you know, it's difficult to open communities, entitlements are challenging today. Our team has done a great job in doing this and obviously that 1% to 3% growth would include the communities that we picked up in the American West transaction. Stephen Kim : And then, you talked about your land spend and obviously you did a great job in sort of spreading around your cash flow to debt pay down as well as repurchase. But the overall level of land spend, it's a little higher than I would have liked to have seen frankly because I would have liked to have seen your overall land investment on your balance sheet reduced as we go forward. Is this level of land spend what you need to be able to maintain your current rate of growth or do you perceive this level of land investment as a level which is setting you up to accelerate your growth in your home building going forward? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes Stephen, it\u2019s a fair question. In terms of actual spend this year on land in the first three and six months, if you exclude the money we spend for American West we're actually flat. So the increase in spend is largely on development dollars which is bringing lots that we put under control on the path to market. I don't want to get into expectations for growth beyond this year. We've given the guide for what we think it's going to be for the balance of the year. But, when we look at capital we start with investment in the business. You heard Ryan's commentary on our view of the market, we remain constructive and so this reflects the opportunities that we're seeing in the market including American West. So not really growing as much as I think you're inferring. So we feel comfortable with the level of spend. Ryan Marshall : Yes Stephen, I would echo Bob's comments and further I would say that we continue to make excellent progress against our goals of three years owned and three years options. Our field teams have just done an outstanding job in working on a local level on a transaction-by-transaction basis to really secure lots that are helping us to turn our assets faster and to minimize the risk that's associated with having too much lined on the balance sheet. Operator : Your next question comes from John Lovallo of Bank of America. Your line is open. John Lovallo : Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions. The first one Bob, it looks like adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales 10.8 was equal to last year's quarter despite the 2% decline in revenue. And also appears that adjusted dollars or SG&A dollars are down on a year-over-year basis. Can you just help us understand what percentage the moving parts there? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. It's an interesting question. There is no one thing to highlight as the driver of the performance during the quarter. I think you've heard us talk about that controlling cost is always a focus of ours as we challenge our team all the way back to 2016 when we took a pretty hard look at expenses and we've continued that focus. So, really it was a cross of bunch of different areas, there's no unique or significant things happening in the quarter. John Lovallo : Okay, that's helpful. And then Ryan, you mentioned not seeing any signs of another pending slow down like in the second half of '18 but I just curious in hindsight what signs did you guys see heading into the back half of last year and what are you looking for? Ryan Marshall : Yes, it's a good question. And then if you'll remember in our second quarter earnings call last year, we highlighted that we started to see some softening, was really in about the third week of April, and for us we saw it really in two forms, really would see it in two forms, the traffic that crosses the threshold of our model homes is certainly one of the leading indicators. Website traffic tends to be a little less predictive but certainly another metric. And then, on a daily basis we can see the number of new contracts that reported from our sales offices and that's arguably the proof in the pudding and the best indicator of an impending slowdown. As I highlighted in my prepared remarks, the first couple of weeks of July, the momentum that we have experienced in Q2 has sustained, we're still seeing very positive trends from buyers. Operator : Your next question comes from Alan Ratner of Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Alan Ratner : Hey guys, good morning, nice quarter. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Alan. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Alan. Alan Ratner : Ryan, I think you were talking a little bit about just the fourth quarter and building up some specs during that software demand period and obviously I think a lot of builders did the same thing and retrospect it, it turned out to be a decent decision because the sales environment improved. If you look at the start status so far year-to-date it's definitely lagged orders and I think a lot of that points to in absorption of a lot of that standing speck that was on the ground heading into the year. So, my first question is can you talk a little bit about what the inventory situation looks like in your markets today both yours as well as probably more importantly other builders. And the second question on that point is just costs have remained in check here and I think a lot of that has to deal with the labor situation maybe not being quite as bad up to this point given that standing inventory. Is there any risk now that the orders are improving that you start to hear more about the labor tightness and challenges that the industry has faced over the first few years of this recovery? Ryan Marshall : Sure, Alan. I'll take the question on inventory and then I'll have Bob address your question on costs. As far as inventory goes at your point, the back half of last year we made the decision to let our spec inventory run a little bit higher than what we typically do. And that was purely aimed at maintaining the momentum of our production machine. At the end of the fourth quarter, our specs is a percentage total inventory was about 31%, actually a little higher than that, that's probably [30%, 33%] I think at the end of the fourth quarter. We saw that come back down in the first quarter and we're now back down to 26% which is more in line with where we typically run. That's total spec inventory at all stages of construction. And then, when you specifically look at final inventory, we continue to be at less than one per final unit, per active community which is the kind of the parameter that we've typically targeted. So, as far as our inventory levels go, Alan, we think we're in great shape. We continue to start homes very much in line with our expectations and so we haven\u2019t necessarily experienced within our business the same situation that I think you described in the overall [starts] data. As far as inventory goes in the broader market, I think it's in a healthy spot when we look at month of supply for both new homes as well as for resale, almost every single market that we operate in remains at a healthy level. Certainly, we've seen some markets take some increases but even with those increases we believe the levels are still at a healthy spot. There are a few competitors that have put more inventory into the ground in an effort to achieve stated closing goals for the year. We are managing against that and competing against that on a case-by-case basis where we run into that. But it hasn\u2019t had a system-wide impact on our businesses; I think it's evidenced by our Q2 results. Alan Ratner : Great, that's very --. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: And Alan, sorry just I wanted to address the comment or the question about costs. I think you asked about labor specifically how broadened, let's talk about our cost in general. The pleasing news is that lumber has trended down, I think everybody is well aware of that. Based on that and generally benign cost environment, we had guided to a 2% increase in our vertical construction cost and we now see it at about 1% for the year. So, the benefit of that lower lumber cost has really come through. The only sort of out-layered to that really is concrete very specific, locally we've seen some pricing pressure there. As it relates to labor, I would characterize that it's still generally pretty tight but not as bad as it has been. So, to your question, we've actually seen some moderation in the pricing pressure. Pricing isn\u2019t going backwards but certainly less upward pressure than there has been and in certain markets we've actually had trades come in and ask looking for work which I think is a good sign in terms of pricing. So, in general, the labor market feels that is because it has. And I think with that there's room for them to do more as evidenced by the fact that we've seen some folks looking for work. Alan Ratner : Got it, that's really encouraging to hear. If I could ask one more, Ryan, just few builders recently have started talking a little bit about single-family rental and either building for operators where you are kind of either bulk selling and some communities or even phases of projects entirely for single-family rental operators. Was curious if you guys have pursued that at all if it's any part of your business today or if there's any thought about embarking on that going forward? Ryan Marshall : Yes Alan, it's not. We have looked at it, we have evaluated it in an environment where it's becoming increasingly more difficult to find well located land, get it in title, develop, etcetera, and we don\u2019t believe that that's the highest in best use of the associated land parcels. We think we're better off putting that available land into our for sale operation. So, other than some small onesie-twosies here and there and specific markets as we close to other communities, that's not a business that we're engaged in. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Bouley of Barclays. Your line is open. Matthew Bouley : Good morning, thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about pricing power in this environment. I guess Ryan, I guess if interest rates have come down obviously, have you found that\u2019s all kind of allowed you to perhaps I guess stimulate price increases. What are you seeing I guess on pricing power today versus eight months ago across the different buyer segments? Ryan Marshall : Yes. So, we've had in specific locations we have had the opportunity to raise prices a bit but on the -- I would tell you that's the minority. The majority of our communities have frankly kind of held -- been held flat. It is still a competitive market, the incentives are still elevated. We continue to make decisions on a community-by-community basis to adjust pace a price in such a way that we think we think we can drive the best outcome for our shareholders and drive the highest return on invested capital and I think you are seeing that in our results. So, with interest rates coming down, it was widely talked about the back half of last year that one of the biggest headwinds that we had was overall affordability. Interest rates are certainly contributing to that, as we've seen interest rates come back down along with some stabilization in overall pricing. I think that's helped to bring affordability in a lot of markets back in line. Matthew Bouley : Okay, I appreciate that. And then I guess, you mentioned incentives, looking at the third quarter margin guide, I think Bob said you said discounts were down 10 basis points sequentially in the quarter. Is there way to quantify what that looks like on orders is I mean Ryan you just mentioned incentives are still elevated but is there any reason to believe at least that sequentially that the discounts on closing shouldn't continue to diminish further in the second half. Thank you. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, I'd rather not -- it's Bob. I'd rather not get into the specific what's base pricing, what's option pricing. We feel pretty good about the market. Obviously, we work to maintain the margins that we have, we have among the highest in the industry. We're pushing opportunity for pricing and that comes in lot premiums and option revenues. And then, we're working to make sure we're turning our assets and we'll use discounting to get there. So, the relative percentages of each of those move over time a little bit. I think the message we want you to hear is that there are still instances in the market and to the question earlier about inventory. There is inventory in the market and we're competing with that to try and turn our assets and we'll continue to do so. It's the reason you saw it move up year-over-year, a little less so first quarter, second quarter. Also important to remember, we are more built to order, so you won't see the impact of today's discounts in our closings for probably a quarter or two. Operator : Our next question comes from Truman Patterson of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Truman Patterson : Hi, good morning guys, thanks for taking my questions and nice results. Ryan Marshall : Thank you. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Good morning, Truman. Truman Patterson : First wanted to dig in, yes, I wanted to dig in on your the main commentary, you said June and July it seems like lower interest rates kept the selling season elongated if you will. In the first quarter you guys noted that the traffic that can to order conversion was a bit low I guess on the second quarter. And has that conversion improved? And what I'm trying to dig at was the second quarter order results was it really driven by better traffic or better conversion? Ryan Marshall : Yes Truman, its Ryan. So, what we have seen in the second quarters, we've seen an increase in traffic that combined with higher community count has led to higher gross sales and also higher absorption rates but I would not attribute it to higher conversion rate in the quarter. Truman Patterson : Okay great, thanks guys. Looking at your cash balance currently about $660 million, what level are you guys comfortable with and could you guys discuss your capital allocation strategy moving forward and if you don\u2019t mind, if I could piggy back off of Stephen's question earlier, how should we think about your [demand] strategy over the next couple of years especially when you overlay this with how you guys think demand is going to shape up? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Sure. We have a lot of liquidity, $600+ million of cash; the billion dollar revolver has about $750 million of availability on top of that. So, liquidity is really strong for us. I wouldn\u2019t want to put an artificial number around it, I think it would depend on what we're spending the money on. Obviously, if we had need for increased liquidity, we could go to the capital market. So, really no target number for cash. And as it relates to how we're going to invest it, I'd point you right back to what we've been telling you for years now which is first in the business. We're going to pay a dividend, we increased it by 20% at the beginning of this year. We would buy back stock with the balance and we've been talking about, we might also look at our leverages, so as act on that in this quarter. I think you can and should expect to see us continue to do exactly that, in exactly that order of priority going forward. We're fortunate the business is cash accretive and we're generating cash strong cash flows even this quarter once again cash flow from operation's positive. So, as it relates to our land strategy over years, I think, I'll refer you back to the first answer which was, we want to invest in the business as long as we are constructive on it. We want to grow with or slightly in advance of the market. We will invest to try and do that. You heard Ryan talk earlier a little bit about how we're doing that as we're building the optionality in our book which provides capital efficiency, greater liquidity. So until you hear us start to say there's something about the market that's causing us to either moderate or reduce our land spend that's where I think you'll see us put the majority of our capital. Operator : Your next question comes from Carl Reichardt of BTIG. Your line is open. Carl Reichardt : Bob, I wanted to ask about the community count guide. You've got 1% to 3% I think each quarter for the rest of the year, but your first-time buyer communities were up 14% this quarter. So as you look out for the rest of the year, are you expecting a more significant acceleration in certain price point or certain geography in terms of store count especially with the active adult being sort of lagging here and you getting those stores open late? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, I don't want to get too granular on that. It becomes a quagmire right. Carl Reichardt : You opened the door, Bob. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: I did, I did. So I would offer that we also had community count growth in the active adult space in this quarter just like we did in the first-time and actually we had a decrease in move-up. I don't think you should expect to see a meaningful change in the business. We did highlight that we would expect the first-time business to be growing based on the sales that we reported. We'll see a little bit of moderation in pricing related to that. Over time I think it's fair to say we've highlighted that we want to get to a little bit closer to 35% of the business in the first-time space. Our land bank today is 37% targeted towards that buyer. That's typically going to have community count associated with it. So I think you'll see our community count move in line with the dialogue we've had over the last two, three years in terms of where we have our investment going and what demographic it's targeting. Carl Reichardt : Thanks and Ryan, could you talk maybe a little bit about two things; one is the private builder acquisition environment. What it might look like if things have changed in the last six months? And then also just the availability of lot options and whether or not we're starting to see developers return to the business in more meaningful numbers as you look to continue to move your mix sort of gradually towards the option site? Thanks. Ryan Marshall : Yes Carl thanks for the question. In terms of the private builder market, I would tell you it's been fairly consistent. There are opportunities out there in various markets. I think given our size and our geographic footprint we tend to get a look at a lot of them. We're not necessarily interested in all of them because I think what you heard from both me and Bob is, we're looking for acquisitions to be aligned with our overall strategy and we're going to continue to be very disciplined along those lines. The Vegas acquisition was one that fit very well with our strategy with how we were trying to position our business and as well as we were able to structure the acquisition such that it also aligned with what we've been trying to do with our land book and with our balance sheet and we'll continue to do that. So as far as, I forgot what the second part was. Are we seeing more developers in the market? Not really. I think it remains a very tough space to see new entrants come in to. So I think you've got certain markets where they're well capitalized developers and they continue to develop land for us. But we're not seeing a wholesale return of developers that went away in the prior downturn and the real constraint there, banks just aren't willing to lend. And so without capital and access to capital is pretty tough for that group to come back into the space. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding the puts and takes to the gross margin guidance in the back half. Bob you referred to the benefits, some of the benefits from lower lumbar impacting your overall construction cost inflation outlook positively. I guess, you're still looking at a down year-over-year dynamic for the second half, but I just wanted to try and get a sense if that was more driven by the higher incentives or land cost inflation combined with other cost inflation because I guess the incentives aren't peeling off maybe as quickly as some had hoped for as this better environment so far this year has played out relative to the back half? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. Mike, I think you got it right. It's all those things candidly. We obviously enjoy like I said earlier among it's not the highest margins of the space. We're proud of it. We're protective of it, but house costs are going up. The tariffs while not significant are impactful. Our land costs are up. We are cycling through land very quickly about three years on average. The option we have built into our book does introduce some cost to that and as Ryan talked about pricing while we take opportunities where we have them, there are discounts in the market and we are playing these. We want to turn our assets we are going to continue that rotation of the asset base. So like I said, it's a pretty healthy world we are living in. We got some cost pressure and we think we are going hold to serve, we think that's pretty good. Michael Rehaut : I appreciate that. I guess secondly, you referred to earlier in the call in terms of your order growth cadence throughout 2Q that April was slow year-over-year and obviously then things kicked in more strongly in May and June. I was just hoping to get a little bit more granularity in terms of the degree of magnitude there. Was April actually down year-over-year, was May and June up over 10% through low double-digits and obviously rates came down, but most builders kind of really didn't point to rate being a driver per se in May and particular given the fact that mortgage rates really didn't even decline in May materially relative to the ten year. So I was wondering what the drivers were, either certain geographic regions sort of markets or certain product segments. So again kind of a two part, one little more granular on the degree of magnitude of the improvements, and then what the drivers were there? Thanks. Ryan Marshall : Mike, so the comment was that on a year-over-year basis April was a bit slower and as I touched on in one of my earlier answers, April was really the last kind of strong month in 2018. So I think the year-over-year comp was probably a little bit more difficult. In terms of the other things that I\u2019d probably offer, the Easter holiday was where the sale had a little bit of an impact in terms of kind of April overall numbers, but I think that all kind of comes out of the wash as you move through the quarter. Seasonality, I would suggest is fairly normal. Little bit better than last year. So we like the way the business is performing. We like what we are seeing. We saw coming out of April which was a fine month. It just was against a comp from last year. It was little tougher. We had a nice May. We had a nice June and the strength has continued into July. Operator : Your next question comes from Jack Micenko of SIG. Your line is open. Jack Micenko : Good morning. Bigger picture question. As you move thinking through the mix and you move from say 27 to 30 onto that 35 first-time. Conventional wisdom is that the lower price point, the first-time homes are inherently lower margin I mean, your first-time is a bit different. But as we think about past 3Q, 4Q into next year and beyond, can you sustain margins all else equal on product set I guess the better way to ask it is, is your first-time margin comparable to move-up, comparable to active adult and where does that 35% share take from any other categories in that margin discussion? Ryan Marshall : Jack its Ryan. Good morning. I appreciate the question. I think what you have heard from us in the past is, we don't underwrite the gross margin. We are underwriting to return and we are positioning our overall book of business in a way that we think we derive the optimal net result by playing in certain geographies and playing against certain consumer groups that gives us the best opportunity to manage risk and have success. I think conventional wisdom to your point would tell you that the first-time space typically comes with a little bit lower margin, the volumes and the inventory turns tend to run a little bit higher which gives you a comparable return as the other segments have a little bit higher gross margins. So we have kind of provided the guide for the full year of this year and you have heard Bob talk about all the puts and takes around what we are expecting in terms of cost increases and where we have got cost pressures, where we have got some tailwinds and what the resulting margin is and you can see that we are still maintaining the best margins in the space. We are very pleased with where we have been able to keep our margins and that is reflective of more business coming through the first-time space. As we get closer to Q4 of this year and get into next year, we will update our guide for 2020 at the appropriate time. Jack Micenko : And then, the mortgage capture rate you called it out, it jumped pretty significantly year-over-year. Is that market conditions and execution in gain on sale getting better or was that partially a component of maybe trying to drive some of the slower demand activity in the back half over the finish line in more recent quarters? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: No, actually it's a concerted effort on our part. Our operators have done a great job as our mortgage company of identifying the divisions where we didn't achieve real success with our capture rate and trying to figure out what caused it. So we're trying to make sure our incentive structures are right so that we drive folks to the mortgage company because what we know is, they serve as a captive model. They do a great job serving only us as a builder and their customer satisfaction scores and net promoter scores are off the charts and so we think it's actually a better experience for our consumers at the same time. What you saw last year was, it was a very, very competitive market. The new money origination had become something that the banks were paying a lot of attention to. As rates go down and re-fi business comes up it softens that a little bit. I wouldn't say it was a lot. So this is really about us focusing on how are we providing that opportunity to the consumer showing them the benefits of working with our mortgage company driving higher capture rate. So it was mostly internal effort. Operator : And our next question comes from Jay McCanless of Wedbush, your line is open. Jay McCanless : Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. The first question I had, the order decline that you saw in the Midwest was that related to any weather issues or delays in getting communities open because of the weather? Ryan Marshall : Not really Jay, the weather to your point was tough and it certainly has an impact, but we wouldn't want to hang the specific result in the Midwest on weather. I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks we just saw the higher price points of our move-up communities which we have quite a few of in the Midwest. We're a little bit softer. Jay McCanless : And then, on the active adult in terms of pricing, do you guys feel like you need to adjust some pricing there or is this just kind of a temporary blip in demand? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, I don't think we need to adjust that. You heard Ryan talk about that that is generally a cautious buyer group noise in the marketplace, kind of puts them back a little bit. It's not about interest rates for them. The other thing that I\u2019d highlight is it's also a consumer that buys what they want. They've got the healthiest balance sheet of any of our consumer groups and they're willing to pay for the things that are important to them. So we haven't seen a real need to try and address the pricing there. Traffic is up. I think at the end of the day it just needs they to get their head in the right space and they'll be back in the market. Jay McCanless : Got it, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : We have run out of time for questions and answers today. I'll now return the call to Mr. Zeumer. Jim Zeumer : Thank you. Appreciate your time this morning and certainly be available the remainder of the day if you have any follow-up questions and we look forward to speak with you on the next call.",

The most significant risk factors that could affect our results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Jim and good morning. I'm excited to speak with you today about PulteGroup's outstanding third quarter results. In addition to discussing our financial performance I'm pleased to report that home buying activity remained strong and even accelerated in the third quarter. Benefiting from the positive demand environment and our strong local market positions, I would highlight that our third quarter orders increased 13% over last year and we reported our highest third quarter order volume since 2006. For the past several years, U.S. housing demand has been supported by an ongoing economic expansion, low unemployment and positive consumer confidence numbers.  It will come as no surprise however, when I say that the catalyst for this most recent rise in housing demand has likely been the decline in interest rates and its impact on the affordability equation. In housing market where years of price appreciation has created affordability challenges for many buyers, the decline in rates has helped to ease the problem. Given this improvement in affordability, we are optimistic about the sustainability of housing demand and the potential for new home sales to continue marching higher.  As Bob will detail, PulteGroup reported strong third quarter operating and financial results that met or exceeded our prior guidance in a number of key areas. Within our quarterly results, you can also see continuing progress against some of our broader operating strategies.  First, we continue to realize success in expanding our presence among first-time buyers as orders increased 39%. Broadly defined, our business objective is to better index our customer mix to the markets we serve with the goal of growing first-time to about one-third of our closings. In this most recent quarter first-time buyers represented 31% of orders and 29% of closings. This is up from 25% of orders and 26% of closings last year. Consistent with this objective, 34% of our lots under control in the third quarter are targeted to serve first-time buyers. Given this mix and the development timelines of our lots in our pipeline, we expect to see an ongoing modest expansion of our first-time business as we progress through 2020 and beyond.  Second, in addition to making progress in shifting the mix of lots we control, we continue to increase our use of lot options to help enhance returns and mitigate certain market risks. We ended the quarter with 161,000 lots under control, of which 42% were held via option. Our target is for 50% of PulteGroup's lots under control to be held via option. Consistent with this goal, I would highlight that 68% of the lots we approved for purchase during the first nine months of 2019 included some form of option. I can't recall a year when we were as successful in securing so many option transactions.  Our local land acquisition teams are doing a great job of tying up lots under such option structures. This includes the American West transaction where we put 3,500 lots under control, two-thirds of which are under option.  And finally, consistent with our long-term focus on effectively allocating capital in support of generating higher returns, we invested approximately $700 million in the business in Q3, while returning a $166 million to shareholders through dividends, and share repurchases. In total, we have returned almost $340 million to shareholders in the first nine months of the year, while still ending Q3 with $769 million in cash, and a net debt to capital ratio of 27.6%. By intelligently investing in our business and running an efficient homebuilding operation, while effectively allocating the available capital, we continue to generate some of the highest returns in the industry.  For the past 12 months, our return on invested capital was approximately 18%, while our return on equity was almost 19%. PulteGroup continues to rank among the industry leaders on both return metrics.  In conclusion, we remain highly constructive on current demand dynamics and the long-term opportunities for the housing cycle, as well as our competitive position within the markets we serve. At 644,000 new home sales over the trailing 12 months, we believe the industry continues to undersupply the country's housing needs. With strong market positions, tremendous financial flexibility, and an unwavering commitment to our homebuyers, we believe PulteGroup can grow its operations while continuing to generate higher returns on our invested capital and equity.  Now, let me turn the call to Bob for a more detailed review of the quarter. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning everyone. As highlighted in this morning's release, we reported an acceleration in sales activity as PulteGroup's third quarter orders increased 13% over last year to 6,031 homes. Orders were higher across all buyer groups and reporting segments, and the 13% increase in quarterly new orders is the largest percentage increase we've generated since the end of 2017.  Analyzing Q3 sales by buyer group shows orders among first-time buyers were up 39% to 1,860 homes, while orders among move-up and active adult buyers both increased by 4% to 2,579 and 1,592 homes respectively.  During the third quarter, we operated out of 865 communities which is up 4% over last year. Adjusting for the 4% increase in community count, our absorption pace for the quarter was up a strong 9%. The increased absorption pace was driven by a 22% increase from our first-time communities and an 8% increase from our move-up communities. Absorption pace in active adult was down 9% against a strong third quarter comp that was up approximately 10% last year.  Moving to our income statement, home sale revenues for the third quarter increased 3% over the past year to $2.6 billion. Our higher revenues were driven by a 3% increase in closings to 6,186 homes as our average sales price of $426,000 this year is consistent with last year.  Given the stronger demand conditions we experienced in the quarter, we were able to sell and close more spec homes, which had a positive impact on our Q3 closing volumes.  Looking at our average sales prices in more detail, our move-up and active adult prices both increased 3% to $491,000 and $411,000 respectively. Pricing for our first-time homes decreased 6% to $340,000. The lower ASP within the first-time reflects a change in mix relating to our efforts to increase our entry level exposure, particularly through community openings in the Southeast, Florida and Texas.  In total, and consistent with our efforts to better index our business to market demand and increase our first-time buyer business, closings by buyer group in the third quarter were 29% first-time, 45% move-up and 26% active adult. This compares to the 26% first-time, 49% move-up and 25% active adult last year.  Our backlog at the end of the third quarter totaled 11,638 homes which is up 4% over last year. We ended the quarter with 11,482 homes under construction, which is an increase of 2%. Of the homes under production, 74% or 8,529 were sold with the remaining 26% being built as spec. At 26%, spec production is consistent with last year and in line with our target range.  Based on our contract backlog and the units we had under construction at the end of the quarter, we expect deliveries in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 6,600 to 6,800 homes. Inclusive of this guidance, we are increasing guidance for the full-year closings to be in the range of 23,000 to 23,200 homes. With a backlog ASP of $430,000 and a relatively stable pricing environment we continue to expect our average sales price of closings in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $425,000 to $430,000. This is consistent with our third quarter results and the guidance we gave on our second quarter earnings call.  Continuing down the income statement, our reported gross margin in the third quarter was 23.1%, while our adjusted gross margin for the period was 23.4%. The adjusted gross margin excludes the $9 million pre-tax charge related to estimated costs to complete warranty repairs in a closed-out community. Our adjusted gross margin was up 30 basis points from our second quarter reported gross margin of 23.1% as we benefited from a stronger demand environment, but was down 60 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year as profitability was impacted by higher land, labor and material costs and slight changes in product mix. In the third quarter, our option revenues and lot premiums increased 1% over the prior year to $82,966 per home. Sales discounts in the quarter totaled 3.8% or $17,000 per home which is up 80 basis points over the third quarter of last year but down 10 points sequentially. Discounts are now down 20 basis points from the beginning of the year.  While demand dynamics are clearly better, we are being careful in our pricing actions as we believe affordability though improved is still an issue within particular markets and buyer segments. With that being said, we do see the opportunity through cost controls and select pricing actions to continue to generating higher gross margins. We currently expect our fourth quarter gross margin to be in the range of 23.2% to 23.4%. Our SG&A in the third quarter was $271 million or 10.3% of home sale revenues, which is in line with our previous guidance. Prior year SG&A expense for the period was $253 million or 9.8% of home sale revenues. The increase in SG&A dollars was driven by a number of factors including IT spend, operating costs associated with the American West transaction, increased model home costs and compensation. Based on our performance of the first nine months of the year, we reiterate our guide for full-year SG&A to be in the range of 10.8% to 11.3% of home sale revenues. In the quarter our financial services operations generated pre-tax income of $32 million, which is an increase of 64% over the third quarter of last year. Our performance was driven by higher volumes as the businesses benefited from our increased homebuilding volumes and higher capture rates, as well as from improved margins in our mortgage operations due to the favorable interest rate environment. In total, our mortgage capture rate in the third quarter increased to 84% from 75% last year.  Our income tax expense for the third quarter was $93 million, or an effective tax rate of 25.4%, which compares with $95 million or an effective tax rate of 24.7% last year. We currently expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be 25.3%, which is in line with previous guidance. Reported net income for our third quarter was $273 million or $0.99 per share, while our adjusted net income for the period was $280 million or $1.01 per share. Reported net income for the third quarter of last year was $290 million or $1.01 per share. Our diluted earnings per share was calculated using 274 million shares, which is a decrease of 11 million shares or approximately 4% from Q3 of last year. Decrease in share count is due primarily to the company's ongoing share repurchase activities.  In the third quarter, the company repurchased 4.1 million common shares for $136 million or an average price of $32.93 per share. During the first nine months of 2019 we repurchased 7.7 million shares of stock for $244 million, or an average cost of $31.86 per share.  As Ryan noted, we ended the quarter with $769 million of cash and a net debt to capital ratio of 27.6%. Our gross debt to capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 34.6%.  Looking at our land activities during the quarter, we invested a total of $693 million in land acquisition related development. This brings our nine month land spend total this year, including the American West transaction in April to $2.2 billion. We continue to expect to spend approximately $2.9 billion on land in 2019.  Finally, at the end of the third quarter, we controlled approximately 161,000 lots, of which 42% were held via option.  Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan for some final comments on market conditions. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. Before opening the call to questions, let me provide a quick review of our market performance in the quarter. In addition to our orders being up 13% over last year, we realized order gains across all geographic reporting segments and buyer groups, which attested the broad base strength in buyer interest. Drilling down a little, we realized generally good demand up and down the Eastern third of the country with particular strength in the Carolinas and Florida. Florida continued to be a standout with strong demand across each of its key markets. Looking at the middle of the country, Texas continued to experience strong demand across its markets with orders up 10%. Demand in the Midwest held up as orders increased 9%, but the move-up part of the business in these markets remains very competitive. And while the GM strike appears to be on track to be settled, we did see an impact on demand in many of our Midwest markets, resulting from the lengthy labor dispute.  Driven by the strength of Las Vegas, including our American West acquisition and Arizona, our West area continued to improve. During the first few weeks of October, buyer interest remains strong as we've seen continued high levels of buyer interest and overall demand. With supportive economic conditions and a low interest rate environment, we look for buyers to remain active right through the end of 2019.  Let me close by thanking all of our employees who have done such an outstanding job this year serving our customers and each other. Thanks to your hard work. We continue to be an industry leader operationally, financially and most importantly with the quality of home and experience we deliver to our customers. We have also recently been certified as the Best Places to Work Company by the Best Places to Work Organization. In an environment where the competition for talent is fierce, we see being an employer of choice is a tremendous advantage.  I will now turn the call back to Jim. Jim Zeumer : Hey. Thanks, Ryan. Julie, if you open the lines we will start our Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Your line is now open. Carl Reichardt : I have -- your last comment Ryan, I was curious about the idea that expecting buyers to remain active through the end of 2019, are you seeing in October and do you expect to see sort of an anti-seasonal strength in traffic and how is your spec situation holdup to be able to maybe turn some of those late coming in orders into deliveries this year? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Carl, we've continued to see nice strength from the buyers as we've been through the first three weeks of October. It's been continued strength similar to what we saw throughout the third quarter. So I feel very good about that. In terms of bucking the seasonal trend, I think it's hard to kind of buck the normal things that are going on in lives and holidays and things of that nature, but certainly the improved affordability environment that we're in I think has got to play well for the entire industry and certainly us. As far as your question on specs Carl, probably less of a spec opportunity for us as we move into the fourth quarter relative to what we had in Q3 and Q2. That being said, we've got a few more spec units in the system right now than we did a year ago, but it's not meaningful to the overall number. Carl Reichardt : Thank, Ryan. And then my follow up is just on lot options. You're running 42 now and you're hoping to get to 50. So are we to infer that you're starting to see an expansion of developers who are willing to do lots with you on an option basis or are there new structures coming or land bankers returning? And I'm just interested since many builders want to expand in that direction whether or not the infrastructure underneath the landside is going to allow for it. Thanks. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Carl, it's been a concerted effort on our part to move in that direction. And we put -- if you go back about three years ago when you first started hearing me talk about this, we put a goal out there. We've I think been using wisdom and judgment in a way that we are able to secure option transactions. There is certainly a cost associated with those. And so I think we've continued to make good economic decisions that make sense for our business and where we use and where we don't.  We're not using land bankers widely throughout the systems, so most of these options are truly with the land seller. I think our reputation, our performance, the brands that we bring to the table certainly help make the offering if you will in doing business with us a compelling one and we're going to continue to try and drive that number closer to the 50% target that we've set. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Evercore. Stephen Kim : I just wanted to follow up if I could on Carl's last question there about land spend. Obviously, given all things being equal, any builder, including yourself would probably rather push a little bit of the risk onto the land seller. So it always comes down to terms and pricing. And so you addressed the fact that you're not using land bankers widely. But you acknowledged that there is an additional cost. And so I was curious if you could also broaden that into the financial terms. How are the terms trending? Are you putting more down for instance, or are there certain sort -- certain types of work that you're committing to do? If you could just sort of talk a little bit about whatever change in terms is happening that's allowing you to make the shift to greater options, while still retaining the judgment?  And then second part of that question is, you gave a goal for the ratio of options. But for modeling, it might be more useful if we actually had a target for actual year supply of land owned, rather than just the ratio of option to total? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Stephen, to the second one, we've been, I think pretty clear that our goal would be to have three years owned, three years optioned. So that's our target as our teams are out building and negotiating the land transactions that we're looking at individual transactions. And if we're getting out, it depends on markets. We've got points of view on length in different markets too. But on balance, we'd like the book to be roughly three years owned, three years optioned.  In terms of terms, really no significant change, and I think it's really the way we're approaching it. So, rather than sort of a blanket to the field, bout, shout, do something, whether it's two years owned or a certain amount of optionality, these are individually negotiated. That's why I think you've seen a fairly measured increase in this over time. We've not seen a push or a need to put more money down. We don't see significant offsites or performance guarantees. So, I would tell you that the options today look a lot like the options we've been working into the system for the last few years. But it's the reason you can't -- you don't see us go from 40% to 60% overnight. It's because we're negotiating deal by deal. Stephen Kim : Thanks for that, Bob. I guess second question I had relates to the commentary you had made about rates. Ryan, you had indicated that rates were obviously a benefit to you throughout the quarter and you anticipated that rates would likely stay relatively low. And therefore that would help demand through the end of the year. I just wanted to dig into that a little bit more. Is there a threshold you have in mind above which -- and I'm talking about a rate threshold -- above which your outlook would reasonably need to change? And could you talk a little bit about the delay that we saw and you saw, I think in terms of your demand response in your markets, even though rates have kind of been falling all year. If you can talk a little bit about the sensitivity, the lag perhaps, and if there is a threshold in mind above which your outlook would reasonably need to change? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, I did highlight rates because I think it was really the last leg of the stool in the affordability equation to come through. So, the way that we like to look at it, we've got rates, we've got home prices and we have wage changes. All three of those things and how they're working in unison, I believe contribute to that affordability equation. With a fairly benign pricing environment, we haven't seen a whole lot of price change, wages that are actually starting to meaningfully increase as well as the interest rates coming down to the level that they're currently at. In our view really improved affordability and I think that's what has really given demand a kick in the pants from the buyer side. So, we feel good about that. Our view that, that can be sustained through the end of the year, I think will continue to bode well for what new orders look like. As far as, is there a threshold? I don't think there is. I think it comes down to what does that affordability equation look like and can the average consumer afford the average new home price or the new home price. That's what I believe it really boils down to.  The last thing I'd just say maybe on interest rates whether they're going up or they're going down. I think it really matters why. And so what's the rest of the narrative that's going on in the overall economy and how that ultimately plays on the consumers well-being and their overall confidence in the economy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Your line is open. Matthew Bouley : So, looking at the sales pace, I believe you did 2.3 for the quarter seems to be a high for Pulte for the cycle. So I know, Ryan, you highlighted kind of the buyer sensitivity around just home prices in general in this market. But is there kind of any expectation at this point that perhaps you could meter that growth a bit and push price further at this stage or just conversely as you guys just keep mixing towards first-time buyers, is that not really the right way to think about it that really sales pace should kind of structurally move higher at this point? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Matthew. Thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. And I guess a couple of things that I would tell you. Number one, our focus has and will continue to be on driving return on invested capital. We don't underwrite the gross margin. And so we are on a community by community basis working the levers between pace and price to drive what we believe is the optimal return outcome. As far as our overall sales mix, certainly our per community sales pace has been helped by our gradual shift and more first-time business, entry level business, which tends to come with a higher per month sales average. And so I think you heard in our prepared remarks, you'll continue to see a little more of that over time, but as we near our target of about one-third of our closing volume coming from that buyer group.  Finally to your question on prices and is there an opportunity for it to go higher? Certainly, the market is strong, but affordability I think has got to continue to carry the day, and we're still kind of balancing right on the -- we're teetering on the edge of a lack of affordability. And so I think our hesitancy there would be to push it too far and break that affordability equation that seems to be working right now. Matthew Bouley : Thanks for that detail. And then just secondly I wanted to follow-up on the gross margin side, I think the Q4 guidance is calling for somewhat flattish to perhaps slightly down gross margin sequentially. And I know Bob you just highlighted that sales discounts do continue to move lower a bit. So, just any other kind of puts and takes in there that might drive kind of that flatter trend in Q4? Thank you. Bob O'Shaughnessy : Yes, fair question. I think it's always worth reminding everyone, we do have the highest margin mix in the builder space and we're protective of that, but you heard Ryan say we actually manage against return. We do have more expensive lands coming through each time. We sell a new house that the land coming behind will be a little bit more expensive. And on the pricing side, we do see some opportunities to raise price, but we always wanted to Ryan's point be mindful of overall availability and affordability. So, mix matters in that certainly as Q4 comes to fruition, you'll have a lot of builders out there working to liquidate their standing inventory and so we think that will impact pricing. So, as we look at the universe, we really like our margin position. But we want to make sure we're productive with our assets. We want to make sure our asset turns are efficient. So, we feel really good actually about the margin profile we're putting out for Q4. Ryan Marshall : Matt, the only other thing I'd add to that is keep in mind given that we're mostly a to be built order model, a large part of what will deliver in Q4 is already in our backlog, and while we've got a few spec opportunities you know those any kind of improved pricing environment reduced discounts don't move the needle a ton at this point for Q4, but as Bob highlighted in his prepared remarks, we are seeing an improvement in the discounting environment, and I think that is reflective of the continued strength we've seen from buyer demand. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is open. John Lovallo : The first question is, the strength in your first-time business was clearly encouraging, but there is some hesitation that seems to still kind of be lingering with active adult and maybe to a lesser extent on the move-up side. So, is there an opportunity to be a little bit more proactive perhaps with the incentives as we move into the fourth quarter here or are you comfortable with the current strategy? Ryan Marshall : Hey, John. It's Ryan. Thanks for the question. We actually feel really good about our active adult business. We saw a 4% increase in new orders in the active adult business. I think what you're likely referring to is the decline in absorptions on a year-over-year basis we are down 9%. I think without getting into kind of too much detail Bob highlighted that it was up against a pretty stiff comp from last year that was up 10% at that point in time. As we looked at it, a couple of other things that I just highlight for you on the active adult side. We've got existing communities where we have added incremental product offerings into an already existing location. The way that we keep track of it and reported that count is an additional community. The absolute gross number of sales out of those locations is increased, but in some cases, it causes the per community number, it's dilutive to the per community number. The other thing that we think we've got going on inside of our active adult business as we move from some of our really large flagship communities and into our smaller faster turning kind of closer in locations. The per community sales out of those smaller locations tend to be a little bit lower.  Now the return profile is every bit is good, the margin profile is everybody is good, but the absolute level of upfront investment in some of these smaller communities is less. And so they don't need to generate the same type of monthly sales to make it work. Those are a few of the things that you know that we've done. And so I think I touched on all those things, John. I'm not sure if there's anything else that was missing there, but we can maybe get it in a follow-up, if I missed anything. John Lovallo : Thank you, Ryan and then maybe just a quick update on American West and its contribution to orders in the quarter? Ryan Marshall : Yes. We're really pleased with that. The orders in the quarter is 145 and the integration has gone really well. Sales activity is strong. We expect closings Q1 of next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC. Your line is open. Mike Dahl : I've got a two follow-up questions on the pricing side. So, I think, Ryan you've clearly articulated the balanced approach, which makes sense given what we lived through over the past year. But just wanted to try to get a sense of, if you can provide just percentage of communities where you've been able to raise pricing either on, it would be great if you could break it down by base price versus where you've just lowered incentives, but any color you can give on just breadth of price increases? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, I don't have that level of detail here that I can provide on the call. Broadly, what I would tell you is that you saw an increase in average sales price in our move-up, you saw an increase in average sales price in the active adult. We saw an increase in our options spend and our lot premiums and we've seen a little bit of a decrease in discounting. So, there has been little bits and pieces kind of across the board. Our gross margin for the quarter was strong. We came in slightly above the guide that we provided. And so I think while we're being cautious. We have seen a favorable pricing environment that's been beneficial to the overall profitability of the business. Mike Dahl : Second question and a follow-on specifically related to specs. You highlighted that as being a contributor to some of the upside around the closings in the quarter and to your point on margins, it doesn't seem like it's coming out a real drag to margins. Do you have the spread on spec versus margins for the quarter and how that compared to the prior two quarters? Ryan Marshall : Yes, we try not to give all that much detail around that, Mike, I think what we've highlighted is that we did see some closing opportunity. If you recall, we came into the year with a little more spec than we thought. We've kind of worked through most of that. It came through in the closings in Q2 and Q3 largely. You saw a little bit of upside relative to our margin guide some of that is mix. Some of that is the spec contribution because it does have a higher than historical margin. So, typically, we would have expected the margin profile to be a little bit less than it was reflective of the demand environment. So, on balance, it was a good thing. Don't want to try and drill into that much detail here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Alan Ratner : Hey guys, good morning. Nice quarter. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Alan. Alan Ratner : So, first question, just going back to the option discussion for a second, if we could. So, first off, congrats on the progress there. I know in the past and you've kind of alluded to this, but understanding you underwrite to an ROIC calculation. Can you talk a little bit about what the margin spread on a typical option deal that you do versus a development deal looks like, and just kind of thinking about what that means to mix shift going forward. If we look at the percentage of your closings this quarter that were I guess originally option deals. How does that compare to the current 42% of your land book that's under option? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, to your second question, Alan, I don't know that on top of my head. We can do a little bit of homework for you. In terms of the forward book, I think, it varies honestly because these options all -- because we're doing them individually, they all have kind of different shapes and sizes. So, the size of the community matters, are we buying raw lots on option or finished lots on option. So, at the end of the day, for us it's just becomes part of the pipeline of land coming through. So, we don't actually analyze it or track it by wasn't an option or not is again the return is the thing we're focused on. I think like anything else if you're asking people to take a little more risk, there's a little more costs associated with that. And we see that obviously, but clearly some of the lots we're doing today were purchased on option two, three years ago. And yet with that we're still able to generate the returns and the margins we are. Ryan Marshall : Yes, and to that point, Alan, I just add onto Bob's comment that we've been doing options for a long, long time. It's not like we were doing none and then we went to the 42% we sit at today. We just felt there was an opportunity to increase it closer to that 50%. So, you're certainly going to see a higher mix of option lot start to mix into the overall closings, but to do kind of the point Bob made it will be mixed into the overall business and we'll provide you kind of what the forward guide looks like as it speaks to the margin profile for future years when we get there. Alan Ratner : Okay. Yes, I appreciate that, Ryan, and I just totally understand that you've been doing this for a while. That's why I want to just kind of attempt to quantify what that mix looks like understanding that it's always been a part of your business. Second question, Ryan, I know you've been obviously very focused on innovation within the sector both on the construction side as well as mortgage-related, consumer-related. So, I was just curious, if you can update us if there is anything you're seeing on the ground that you're particularly excited about or that the company is embarking on that might change the way you either build houses, sell houses anything along those lines? Ryan Marshall : Yes, I think two things Alan there I would give a shout out to our financial services team. They have done just a wonderful job in innovating in the eyes of the consumer and making it easier to apply for and go through the mortgage process as they move throughout the cycle. And I think the results are evident in the 84% capture that we had in the current quarter. It's a win for our company and I think our customers are getting great satisfaction and high kind of overall net promoter scores and things of that nature by being with our internal mortgage company. So, Deb still who runs our financial services organization and her team. I think they just done a wonderful job in taking care of our customers. So, nice innovation there and we've got some neat things coming down the pipeline in the future that will continue to make it better. The second thing, Alan, that I'm really excited about is it relates to home building operations is the off-site manufacturing opportunities that continue to evolve. And there is great conversations there and we continue to have significant dialog and at the table with other partners and vendors and manufacturers that I think can meaningfully change the way that we build houses in the future. We know labors getting more and more tight. And so the opportunity to get some efficiencies in the way that we produce will significantly help to solve some of the problems that I think are inherent in a shortage of labor. The last thing is the high buyers. We're seeing some nice things happening there that I think are helping us and helping the consumers reduce the amount of friction that's involved in marketing and selling home. So, the Opendoors, Offerpads, Knock et cetera, all of those companies are companies that we're working with as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Ken Zener : SG&A, if you're giving 10.8 to 11.3 for the year, it's kind of implying up 4Q from 3Q consistent with last year. So I understand that. Could you just Bob go into a little detail why when you have higher revenue, your SG&A is going up, just so I can understand that? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, we talked about it, Ken, in our prepared remarks, and we had a couple of areas where we had some increased spend first is IT. There we are investing in the business. We've got several projects in our IT is -- our IT department has a lot going on and these are projects that will take candidly a number of years to finish. And so we're working through that. You also see American West we had highlighted that will continue. We've got spend. So, if you think about what we did, we bought the lots, but didn't buy the backlog, but we took the people, so they continue to sell and build homes. So, we've got overhead costs associated with that in the business that will continue in Q4 and we won't get the closings until next year. We do have more models with more communities open that will continue. So, really it's more of the same in Q4 as to what you saw in Q3. It's what we guided to. So, this is spend that we knew was coming and we've talked about that really the leverage will get out of the business over time will be volume-oriented. And so as the business grows, we think we can be more efficient, but really nothing in Q4 or Q3 that we didn't see coming. Ken Zener : True, but I guess to the extent and you highlighted specific items this year. We saw that same trend last year. I mean, is that something just about how you kind of capitalize in terms of CapEx your business is my question? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Not sure I followed, Ken. Ken Zener : Last year you didn't get SG&A leverage either in the fourth quarter, even though you had more revenues. I am just seeing, if that's something particular to how you guys, right, pursue IT? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Well, I think if you're looking at last year specifically, certainly compensation would have been a bigger part of the conversation because we've got annual plans and long-term plans and we had a pretty good year last year. And so that was reflected in that, but I don't think there's anything structural certainly last year over this year or last year and this year that would cause us to think that we're losing leverage. We'll dig into it though. We'll see if there's anything else there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rohit Seth from SunTrust. Your line is open. Rohit Seth : Just with your comments on land spend and closing out of communities during the quarter, I mean, just hopefully can you share any thoughts on the direction of community count over the next six to 12 months? Ryan Marshall : We haven't given any guide. Yes, we'll do that as we release our fourth quarter earnings in January. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Maggie Wellborn : Hi. This is actually Maggie on for Mike. First, I wanted to ask about the cadence of orders throughout the quarter. Did you see strong demand across all three months or any months stronger than others? Ryan Marshall : Maggie, all three months proved to be similarly strong relative to prior year. It was in a overall balanced quarter. Maggie Wellborn : And second I wanted to ask about your West segment. You pointed the improvement this quarter driven by Vegas and Arizona. And last quarter you had mentioned that in California you were still seeing challenging conditions, but they kind of seem to be stabilizing, and you were beginning to see a return of buyers to your communities. So, I was wondering if you could give an update on what you saw in California this quarter? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Southern California I would characterize is continuing to improve not completely out of the woods, but we're seeing some green shoots. And Northern California is a market that I think is still challenged by affordability in particular in the Bay Area, which is where most of our assets are concentrated that part of the country continues to be a little slow. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Truman Patterson : Just wanted to talk about your first-time buyer strategy. It's now 34% of lots. It seems like you guys might let that drift higher going forward slightly. But how comfortable do you feel letting this segment get in size based on the current market conditions you guys had really robust demand there. And then maybe could you just elaborate a little bit on your strategy really to target that buyer from a product and land perspective? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Truman, we obviously are very pleased with the results that we saw out of that first-time space and we're going to stay disciplined and kind of the way that we see the broader market through cycles. Certainly it's a consumer that's doing really well in the current cycle, but I don't know that we would want to wildly shift our focus completely to that side and lose sight of the other strong segments that we have in our business in the active adult and the move-up. So, we've intentionally kind of targeted at about a third of our business. The mix of lots that we have is right in line with that and you'll start to see that come through in our closing mix a little bit more each and every quarter. And so we continue to be very pleased. As far as how we're targeting that buyer, it really is about affordability. I think it's also about making the process easier. And so there is a few things that we're doing and simplifying the way that we market communicate and sell to that buyer and where we've got a number of kind of test projects that we're running in our Texas business and in some of our businesses in the West and we're excited about kind of what that holds for the future of our first-time and entry level business. Truman Patterson : Jumping over to the labor environment hoping you guys can give us an update on that. What you're seeing very nice rebound in the housing market the past few quarters. Are you starting to see wage inflation accelerate or are you starting to see availability issues start to rear up that's causing lengthening construction cycles or anything like that? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Truman, it's a great question. Interestingly, no, we haven't. To this point at any rate, the availability is there. Pricing is not aggressive. I think part of that has to do with the mix of homes that are being built. So, as you move down into this entry level lower optionality smaller floor plans especially for the folks that are building more spec those homes are a lot more efficient to build. And so I think you can move more through the system with the labor that we've got. And I think the entire industry is benefiting from that. So good news is at least to this point, knock on wood, it's been a pretty good environment. We had given a guide for our labor and material input cost to be up about 2% this year. We actually think that's closer to 1% now. Part of that is that the labor environment has been pretty attractive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is open. Jack Micenko : I wanted to revisit Ken's question a little bit on the G&A side. I know you called out some one-timer. Is it fair for us then to assume some of those expenses this year or more temporary and we'll see incremental leverage going forward or Bob is your IT commentary suggests maybe this is more of a flat line on the ratio? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, certainly for the IT. What we do obviously as we've got some costs that are capitalized and when systems come online we actually depreciate them. That I think is a kind of an increase in cost. Others, if we've got expenses just associated with running the department, that's a period cost, so that can go up or down depending on the level of spend. We talked about American West, obviously, we'll get leverage on that, but we start to see closings beginning in January of next year. So, we haven't given the guide for next year. Once again we'll do that as part of our Q4 earnings release. But like I said I don't think there's anything structurally that makes us think that we're losing leverage in the business at all. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Jack, and the only thing maybe just to pile on there is the leverage that we're seeing as well within the guide that we've provided. I think Bob's commentary about the increase over prior year and some of the things that he called out were to show the differential and total spend this year relative to last year. Jack Micenko : Okay. And then on mortgage really nice results there. Looking back, I'm not sure you've done a better 3Q margin in that business and maybe ever. So, you've got the three legs, alright, you've got capture rate better, you've got more volume. But you've got to be doing something on the cost to originate side it looks like. Is that fair to assume and our margins in that business absent the first two sort of just inherently improving as you maybe invest in that business. Just curious what's driving these really good margins? Ryan Marshall : Yes, it's sort of all of those things. If you think about the environment that the mortgage originators are operating in today, falling rates, a big refi business going on right now. So, the market is attractive and we're taking advantage of that. But -- and you raised a great point, we've actually reduced our cost to produce loans, which is every bit is impactful to our bottom-line and you talked about the third leg, obviously, a 9% increase in capture is a big volume generator for us. And so we've kind of hit on all three in this most recent quarter. The refi business might start to slow down. So, the rate environment might become a little bit more challenging as -- call in the next six, 12 months, but what we've got there is a really efficient team and one that's focused on customer satisfaction in order to drive that continued improved capture rate environment. So, the team is; A, taking advantage of the market that's there, but also getting better at what they do, which will be an annuity for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless from Wedbush. Your line is open. Jay McCanless : The first question I had, what do you expect for community count for 4Q? Bob O'Shaughnessy: The guide we've given, Jay, is 3% to 5% year-over-year same quarter. Same quarter to prior year same quarter. Jay McCanless : And then the second question I had just trying to catch up with the share repurchase. What was the actual share count at quarter-end? Bob O'Shaughnessy: The weighted average share count was 274 million, the outstanding shares is 271 million. Jay McCanless : And then the last question I had was on active adult. Could you guys -- I know you've talked in the past about shifting to some of these smaller, faster turning communities. What would you say the percentage of total Del Webb or some of these newer generation communities versus the older larger communities? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Well certainly in terms of the number of communities, the majority is the newer, smaller, faster turning. I'd have to do the math to see what percentage of the sign ups was or closings came out of those. But yeah there are not very many of those big bold, but I used to call the cruise ship Del Webb's left. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Seaport Global. Your line is open. Mark Weintraub : Two quick cleanup questions. One just on share repurchase. How price sensitive do you consider yourselves to be or is it you have cash flow to be put to good use and share repurchases and gets a percentage of that cash flow? Ryan Marshall : Yes, it's interesting, I feel like a broken record with this one sometimes, but we've got a very clearly articulated capital allocation policy. First and foremost in the business, we want to pay our dividend through cycle, we obviously raised our dividend this year 20% then we've introduced debt. So, you saw some of our capital to buy in some of our near-dated debt in this year and that we would use excess capital to return to shareholders. Having said that, we're not stock pickers. So, we're not trying to time the market, but we do have a view on value. And so as we look over time and it really is over time. Today we have almost $70 million in cash, strong cash generation of the business, but we're looking over a three-year horizon in the business. And so I think you'll always see us active in the equity market. Our spend is influenced by; A, what are we going to put in the business and what do we think about that. Other possible uses of capital and to an extent the share price as well. So, we're not making that, we've got a process we go through with our board that is pretty thoughtful actually in terms of how we actually invest in the business and in our stock. Mark Weintraub : And then just second given the questions on labor etc and you made the point on offsite manufacturing is something you're exploring. How soon might we start seeing more aggressive measures on offsite manufacturing? What type of timeline on those initiatives? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Mark, it's something that I think we've said we'll take some time to play out. It's a business that I think will meaningfully change the landscape of home building over the next three to five years and even probably more over the five to 10-year cycle. So, we've really worked to simplify our business over the last 10 years, the number of floor plans that we have in our portfolio, how efficient they are to build. We've been preparing to move a significant chunk of our volume that is well designed and simplified into a factory environment. We're already using a high percentage of wall panels. About 60% of the homes that we frame in wood are already using pre-manufactured wall panels and pre-manufactured trusses. So it's -- look, I think, it's closer than you think and it's already starting to be embedded into our business, but I do believe that over the kind of medium-term you'll start to see even more changes to the industry and to our business for sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open. Buck Horne : I'll try to make this pretty quick. I think, Bob, you mentioned your labor and materials cost inflation was trending more towards 1% this year. Could you possibly break that apart in terms of the labor and material side in terms of how those trends, cost trends are faring. And just as we're looking ahead how do you -- how you guys planning for lumber costs with some of the mill shutdowns out there and do you think that could start to rise on you into 2020? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, we haven't sliced the onion that thin in terms of what percentage of the costs are doing what. But what we did highlight for you guys is that in the 2% guide of material input costs that it was against the backdrop where lumber was down. And so the increase was labor because most of the other input costs are pretty flat year-over-year. And so what that should be done is lumber has been what we expected and labor has come in a little bit. In terms of what do we think about the lumber market certainly the supply dynamics matter, the demand dynamics matter. We'll give you our view on what we think that means for 2020 when we release our earnings and by then I think we'll have a pretty good view into people's expectations for both of those supply and demand dynamics around lumber. And so we'll give you our view on how we think it's going to influence the business next year. Buck Horne : And my second question just as demand and just overall fundamentals have improved. I'm wondering if the environment for M&A opportunities is evolved at all. And is there potentially interest in finding another partner like an American West if there is another market that a deal like that would exist is the appetite or the environment evolved on M&A possibilities? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Buck, I would put M&A into the priority that Bob laid out. Our first priority in terms of capital allocation, which is to invest in the business and that's the category that we look at M&A in. For the most part when we're looking at M&A it is because we've got an interest in a market we're not in or there is a land pipeline that's available that will continue to help support our market position. American West certainly fit into that. We had a great Vegas operation. We've made it even stronger with the addition of American West. We've got an always-on appetite for M&A, but it needs to line up with where we're going strategically. Is it helping us with the amount of lots that we're looking to have and the way those lots are structured. Is it helping us with the consumer group? Is it helping us with a market? We're not interested in M&A just for volume sake is, I think, the key points that I'd want to share with you relates to M&A. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Barron with Housing Research. Your line is open. Alex Barron : I wanted to ask about your first-time buyer or entry-level segment. How does the margins there compared to the rest of the company. I've heard some company's comment that they are a little bit lower than move-up and some say that they are few hundred basis points higher. So, I'm just kind of curious where you guys stand? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alex, it's Ryan, we've got a nice margin profile in that business right now and it's largely because that's where the majority of the growth has been and it's where we've seen a lot of price appreciation. So, the margin profile is actually just a tad higher than our move-up right now. Historically speaking it's been the lower margin profile, but the inventory turns more than offset that, and you see a very similar return profile as you do in any of the other segments. Alex Barron : And then can you remind me what percentage of the business it is today and where would you guys see that going in the next couple of years? Ryan Marshall : It's 29% of our closings in the current quarter and we see it going to about a third of our business overall. Alex Barron : And lastly, is there any reason why your interest expense wouldn't go down as a percentage of revenues next year. It doesn't seem like your current interest expense the same as your interest incurred. So, I'm just trying to reconcile those. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, it's a fair question. Obviously with the leverage that we took out of the business this year we see a lower cash cost. All of our interest gets capitalized and amortized over time. And so you'll see that influence over the next couple of years honestly. Our capitalized interest charge in our gross margin. So, all things being equal if revenue stays the same, you'll see it be a little bit of a tailwind in our margin over time. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. Ryan Marshall : Okay. Thanks, everybody for your time this morning. We'll certainly be available over the course of the day if you have any other questions and we'll look forward to talking to you on Q4. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator instructions]. I will now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead Sir. Jim Zeumer : Thank you, James and good morning. I want to welcome participants to this morning's call to discuss PulteGroup's outstanding fourth quarter 2019 operating and financial results. I'm joined this morning by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior VP of Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later today. I want to highlight that we will be discussing our reported results today as well as results adjusted to exclude the impact of certain significant items. A reconciliation of these adjusted results to our reported results is included in this morning's release, within the webcast slides accompanying this call. We encourage you review these tables to assist in your analysis of our results. Before I turn the call over to Ryan, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes board looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect our results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Jim and good morning. As detailed in this morning's press release. PulteGroup's fourth quarter results closed out 2019 on a high note, which I believe positions the company for even greater successes in the year ahead. Our outstanding Q4 results reflect the strength of our overall market positions and homebuilding operations in combination with an ongoing acceleration and fundamental housing demand. What have you is particularly encouraging is the broad base strength of the housing market. As our Q4 order rates were higher across each of our geographic areas, and across each of the buyer groups we serve. Reflective of this strength and demand traffic to our stores was up 14% over the prior year, while order rates increased 33%. Housing continues to benefit from favorable market dynamics including strong employment, consumer confidence and demographic numbers, which have underpinned demand for the last several years. I think improved affordability across many markets is now adding incremental support and allowing more consumers to get actively engaged in the home buying process. While the slow start to 2019 resulted in our full year closings and revenues being up only slightly over last year, we still deliver increased earnings per share, generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow. And that's after having invested $3 billion into the business. And we also returned almost $400 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We were also successful in strengthening our financial position, having retired $274 million of our bonds that were scheduled to mature in 2021, with this helping us to enter the New Year with a net debt to cap of only 21.7%. Couple all of this with our highest ending backlog in over a decade. And I think it's clear that we're extremely well positioned to grow the business and deliver even greater financial results in 2020. While I am excited to speak with you this morning about this morning's announced acquisition of Innovative Construction Group, I'm first going to turn the call over to Bob so he can finish reviewing our financial results. Bob? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Thank you and good morning, everyone. PulteGroup's order volume and absorption rate were the highest we have generated in the fourth quarter in more than a decade. For the period net new orders totaled 5,691 homes, which is an increase of 33% over the prior year. As Ryan indicated, we experienced strong demand across all geographies and buyer groups. For the quarter, our first time buyer orders increased 57% to 1,743 homes; move-up orders increased 27% to 2,471 homes, while active adult orders increased 22% to 1,477 homes. In the quarter we operated from an average of 865 communities, which is an increase of 5% over the prior year community count of 825. Adjusting for community counts absorption pace was up 27% over last year. Consistent with our orders we realized higher absorption rates across our entire portfolio as absorptions increased 38% among first time buyers, 29% among move-up buyers and 10% among active adult buyers. The improved operating environment contributed to the company's strong financial performance in the quarter, as home sale revenues increased to $2.9 billion. Higher revenues in the period were driven by a 2% increase in closings to 6,822 homes, as our average sales price was down less than 1% to $429,000. Our average sale price for the period reflects a combination of pricing dynamics and mix just realized in the period. More specifically, our average sales price for move-up and active adult closings increased 4% to $494,000 and $423,000 respectively, while pricing for first time homes decreased by 8% to $342,000. It's worth noting that the decrease in first time ASP reflects the ongoing and purposeful expansion of our entry level business, particularly in the southeast Florida and Texas. This successful expansion of our first time business is also demonstrated in the mix of our fourth quarter closings. By buyer group closings in the quarter were comprised of 32% first time, 45% move-up and 23% active adult, as compared with 26% first time, 47% move-up and 27% active adult in the fourth quarter last year. These results include the closing of 432 more first time homes this quarter from the fourth quarter last year. Given the increased investment we have been making an asset that serve this buyer group, we believe we are well positioned to continue expanding this element of our business. The strong order environment has also contributed to a 20% increase in our backlog over the same period last year to 10,507 homes. As a result, we've been increasing our production such that we had 10,780 homes under construction at the end of the quarter, which is up 14% over last year. Of the homes under production 69% are sold, while the remaining 31% are spec. On a percentage basis spec production down from last year, but up sequentially. This largely reflects the introduction of incremental spec units on our entry level communities as we seek production efficiencies, and to meet the moving ready expectations of that buyer group. Given the homes we have under contract and introduction, we expect first quarter deliveries to be in the range of 5,300 to 5,500 homes. At the midpoint this would represent an increase of 17% over the first quarter of 2019. With this strong start to the year, we expect full year deliveries to be in the range of 25,500 to 26,250 homes in 2020. Based on the relative strength of our first time communities, we expect the average sales price of closing through the first quarter will be in the range of $410,000 to $415,000, with full year ASP in the range of $415,000 to $420,000. Continuing down the income statement, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was 22.8%, compared with prior year reported and adjusted gross margin of 21.5% and 23.8% respectively. Our gross margin for the quarter came in lower than our previous guidance due to a number of factors. Notably, we delivered more homes than we expected in California, where pricing was under pressure much of the year. In addition, we realized higher than expected warranty costs at a limited number of previously closed communities and we recorded a couple of minor inventory impairments. Well, none of these items were individually significant. Together they did act as a margin drag in the period. Demonstrating the real ongoing strength of our business, we expect our first quarter gross margin to increase sequentially and to be in the range of 23.0% to 23.3%. In fact, the potential is there for margins to improve further as the year progresses. And we currently expect full year gross margins to be in the range of 23.0% to 23.4%. Reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $262 million, or 8.9% of home sale revenues included a $31 million pre-tax benefit from an insurance reserve adjusted recorded in the period. Excluding this benefit our adjusted SG&A expense was $293 million or 10% of home sale revenues. SG&A expense for the prior year fourth quarter was $292 million or 10.1% of home sale revenues. With expectations for higher closing volumes in 2020, we believe we can realize incremental overhead leverage. As such we expect SG&A expense for 2020 to be in the range of 10.5% to 10.9% of home sale revenues. Our financial services operations generated fourth quarter pre-tax income of $34 million, compared with $5 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Last year's results included a charge of $16 million for a reserve adjustment recorded in the period. This year's improved financial performance also benefited from a strong margin environment, higher loan volumes resulting from growth in our home building operations as well as a higher capture rate. In fact, our mortgage capture rate increased to 84% from 77% last year. In the fourth quarter our income tax expense was $100 million for an effective tax rate of 23% compared with $92 million for an effective tax rate of 27.9% last year. Our fourth quarter rate was lower than our previous guide as we benefited from an adjustment in evaluation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets, as well as the benefit related to the recent approval of the energy tax credit. Looking ahead for 2020, we expect our base effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. In total, are reported net income was $336 million or $1.22 per share in the quarter. On an adjusted basis our net income for the quarter was $312 million or $1.14 per share. In the prior year our reported net income in the fourth quarter was $238 million or $0.84 per share while well adjusted net income was $314 million or $1.11 per share. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS was calculated using approximately 271 million shares, which is down 9 million shares or roughly 3% from the fourth quarter of last year. Our lower share count is due primarily to our ongoing share repurchase activities. During the fourth quarter, we invested $771 million in land acquisition and development spend bringing our total land spend for 2019 to $3 billion. We ended the year with approximately 158,000 lots under control, with 41% of them held via option. Looking to 2020, we expect our total land spend to increase to approximately $3.2 billion. Given our existing land pipeline, we expect full year 2020 community count growth of 1% to 3% over 2019. Growth will be closer to 3% to 5% in the first quarter of the year, reflecting the benefit of last year's American West acquisition. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 765,000 common shares for $30 million for an average price of $39.16 per share. For the full year, we repurchased 8.4 million shares for $274 million for an average price of $32.52 per share. After all this activity, we ended 2019 with $1.2 billion of cash and as Ryan mentioned a net debt to capital ratio of 21.7%. On a gross basis, our debt to capital ratio is 33.6%, which is down 500 basis points from last year. Let me now turn the call back to Ryan for some additional comments. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Bob. Consistent with the 33% increase in orders, the demand environment in the fourth quarter was obviously much stronger than last year. We saw generally strong demand in the eastern third of the country with Florida continuing to deliver exceptional performance. Demand in our Midwest and Texas operations was also much improved with our Texas business in particular, benefiting from increased business among first time buyers. Demand out west was certainly much stronger in the quarter and I would cautiously highlight that Northern California appears to be finding its footing after a tough 12 plus months. Strong fourth quarter demand, which has continued into the first few weeks of January, has us heading into 2020 with much higher expectations than we had at this time last year. We're optimistic that a good macroeconomic backdrop and better affordability should keep buyer interest high in the year ahead. Now, with the review of our operating and financial results Complete, I want to discuss PulteGroup's acquisition of Innovative Construction Group or ICG. For several years, you've heard the construction industry talk about a tight labor market and how this is adding to our construction costs and cycle times. Given these conditions, you've also heard us discuss efforts to expand the use of offsite manufacturing in our construction operations. As we launched our commonly managed plan platform in 2011 to better standardize our product offering and simplify our purchasing and construction processes. In 2019, 81% of our closings were from our common plan portfolio. With the success of this platform, we have viewed capturing the benefits of offsite manufacturing as a next logical step. Over the last 18 months, we've met with numerous businesses that are working to bring increased automation to homebuilding. It is through this work that we identified ICG which provides framing solutions to residential and commercial contractors in and around the Jacksonville market. ICG's offsite solution includes offering design services, manufacturing wall panels, roof trusses and floor systems and onsite installation to provide a full frame shell construction process. In evaluating ICG, we were very impressed by the management team, along with the product quality, production efficiency and overall innovation of the plant's operations. Working closely with the company founders, who will continue to lead ICG going forward, we plan to extend the use of preassembled floor systems and to expand the factories production capabilities to include installed windows, and wall prep for mechanical, electrical and plumbing. ICG will remain a standalone operation and continue serving its existing customer base and build their clients. This acquisition has the potential to benefit our Jacksonville operations through faster cycle times, precision structural components and savings on lumber and other materials. More importantly, we see this facility as a model for integrating increased offsite production in other PulteGroup divisions. While likely a few years down the road, the opportunity is there to develop comparable production plants in areas where scale and adjacent markets can support a dedicated factory. It is important to note that ICG is just one component of our strategy, as we do continue to partner with key suppliers to move more of our production into a factory setting. This is one plant serving one market, but we're greatly encouraged by the potential offsite production offers to enhance our operations in North Florida today and other markets in the future. We see the opportunity to produce high quality components with greater efficiency, while allowing PulteGroup to work more effectively with its trade partners. We look forward to providing updates on this venture and related activities as they develop. Before opening the call to questions, I want to welcome the employees of ICG into the PulteGroup family and thank our entire team for their outstanding work in 2019. Thanks to your efforts, the company is operationally and financially strong, and we head into 2020 with tremendous momentum. Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim Zeumer : Okay, thanks, Ryan. We'll now open the call for questions so that we can speak to as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. James you explain the process again. We'll get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks, good morning, everyone. The first question I had was just on the drivers of the gross margin for 2020 and expecting a little bit of improvement. I was hoping you can break down how you're thinking about the different components of that \u2013 those drivers by either mix, pricing, costs, cost inflation what are the bigger drivers there? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, Mike, it's Bob. Obviously when we look at the business and how we want to project our margins going forward, the first start we've placed \u2013 the first place we start is our backlog. We've got a strong backlog coming into the year. So we know that pricing embedded in that. We think about how the business has performed largely over the last three months, as we've built that backlog. And so as an example, California, we've seen pricing get a little bit firmer out there, we've seen a little bit more volume. And so I guess, as simply as I could say, it's based on what we see in our backlog. We're not assuming price appreciation. I can tell you that as we look at vertical construction costs in fiscal '20, we see about a 1% increase. So relatively modest inflation, a lot of costs are obviously going to get a little more expensive as we move more recent into the surface of the portfolio. But again, that's all factored in, but we're not doing price appreciation in that guide. Michael Rehaut : Okay, appreciate it. I guess for my second question and I apologize, I was pulled away for a moment during some of the prepared remarks. The ICG acquisition, I was curious about that in terms of the rationale and again, I apologize if you kind of addressed this already, but just the rationale behind buying the company outright versus being a customer as is and reaping the benefits of the efficiencies of the business or the business relationship simply as a customer or perhaps making an equity investment to allow the company to grow further without fully consolidating it and kind of adding an additional cost structure so to speak onto your own book. Ryan Marshall : Hey, Mike, it's Ryan and good morning. Thanks for the question. I think as we looked at \u2013 the way I'd explain that as we looked at ICG, I think there were a number of different ways that we potentially could have reaped some of the benefits associated with the offsite manufacturing. You highlighted a number of those. We elected to go the route that we did for a number of reasons, which I probably won't get into on this call. What I will tell you is the path that we've chosen to take on this particular acquisition was right for this particular opportunity. Where we're going to is as we look at our entire operation across the country, continue to leverage relationships with other suppliers where we're looking to move as much of our production into automated type factory settings as we can. And in many of those cases, it will be with existing suppliers that are bringing technology to the table. We are going to use the learnings from this point to certainly enhance right away our Jacksonville operations. And we'll use those learnings down the road to potentially look at standing up new plants of our own, where we have the right amount of volume to support those. So we're really excited about what this does. It's been a journey, frankly, in the making since 2011, when we started our commonly managed plan portfolio. And this is the next logical step. So more to come, but suffice it to say we're pretty excited about what this opportunity holds for the industry. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Stephen Kim : Yeah, thanks a lot guys. Let me follow on Mike's question here on ICG. I have a number of questions maybe you can just say to take them all as one. I'm curious about your longer term plans, there's opportunity to expand? Are you thinking that it's going to be more along the lines of these integrated systems, with the mechanicals, integrated and windows or it would more kind of like the raw \u2013 the bare skeleton as you think about the opportunities? And can you give us a sense for the \u2013 an estimate of how much you think that you're saving? Or they are saving in the Jacksonville market, and whether you think that that's something which can increase as you take this across the country Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Stephen, I'll take the first question, as far as where we see this going in the future, and I think it's really the later or the first piece that you mentioned, which is to take it to the level of plumbing, electrical, window installation, et cetera. So I think Even an advanced level of manufacturing, from what's readily available, I think in most markets today with just the raw frame shell. So ICG is already starting to do some floor cassettes, which we think is kind of in that more advanced level offsite manufacturing. And as we look to this existing operation plus the places down the road, we think the real opportunity is to get into the more advanced manufacturing. We're certainly going to get benefits today from kind of the frame shell components of walls and trusses. But where we really see the benefit coming is in those more advanced manufacturing techniques. In terms of kind of the benefits, Stephen, we certainly believe that there's benefit there. I would highlight for you that this is a kind of single plant in a single market, so any impact in our overall reported results I think will be modest. But it's a big step for the company and a journey that we're really excited to take over the next two or three years. Stephen Kim : Excellent, well, I know you guys have done a tremendous amount of work there. So I've been probably one of the best positions to know. Second question relates to the entry level segment of the market. We highlighted this morning that there were some changes done with respect to housing policy or at least changes that look like they're coming which could be helpful to the lower end of the market, even beyond what we've seen over the last couple of years. I'm curious as to whether or not you have seen any change in the entry level of the market. We know that there's been a lot of other folks moving into that segment of the market in a more serious way and I was curious Whether or not you have continued to see strength at the entry level, or if you've seen it start to moderate in any way. So just your commentary about what you're seeing in the marketplace from a \u2013 at the lower end of the market. Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Stephen, it's Ryan, I'll take the first piece of that. We are seeing continued strength and I think it's evidenced in our reported numbers for the fourth quarter on our first time entry level space. We had 57% year-over-year signup growth, which is pretty robust. So we're excited about that. We're excited about the continued investment that we've been making over the really the last two and a half years to meaningfully move the number of lots that we control that are specifically targeted to this first time space and so I like how our position there. Some of the changes that you speak to I think have certainly helped with the overall affordability equation in providing attractive and accessible financing to even more buyers. And I think that is all factored into the overall demand situation that we're seeing from the first time entry level buyer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Matthew Bouley : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the move-up business, obviously strong absorption growth there as well in the quarter. And obviously many are your competitors leaning harder and into the entry level. So I guess on move-up how do you think about at this point Pulte's position competitively, both in terms of land acquisition and potentially even pricing power at move-up communities just because simply you don't quite hear as much about your competitors leaning into that part of the business as much. Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Matt, it's a good question and I think it highlights the reason or maybe gives me an opportunity to reiterate the balanced mix and the balanced approach that we've \u2013 that we have tried to take with our business. And if I take you back to kind of late 2016, where we started talking about was an opportunity to shift about five points of our business out of move-up and into entry level. And you're starting to see the results in our closed home mix from that effort. What that yields. Just to give you some specific numbers, in the fourth quarter 43% of our signups were from our move-up business. So it continues to be the largest piece of our business. It's a very profitable piece of our business and it carries kind of our flagship brand of Pulte Homes. So we like our position. We have not abandoned it at all. Rather, I think we've more appropriately shaped the size of that business to be reflective of the market opportunity. We think we've also \u2013 the counterbalance to that is that we think we've gotten better position to take advantage of the first time opportunity as well. Suffice it to say, we don't have all of eggs in any one single basket and we like that. Matthew Bouley : Okay, appreciate that color. And then secondly, I wanted to ask on the SG&A side. You're guiding to relatively flat leverage in 2020, maybe slight leverage of the midpoint. But obviously, you are set up well from a backlog standpoint around revenue growth. I guess, just are there any other expenses? There were some of the IT spending you were talking about last quarter, that we should be aware of that might prevent some of the kind of additional SG&A leverage. Thank you, Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, Matt, it's Bob. We \u2013 obviously, when you adjust for the current year, we come in around 10.8%. So the range that we've given shows some \u2013 even at the midpoint some improvement over that. Certainly we've talked about over the last couple of years that we've been on a journey on the IT side, the upgrades of our systems, as those systems get put in place, we're actually starting to depreciate them now. So we've got some costs associated with that, so really nothing new or unusual in that. It's really just being able to leverage the increased scale of the business. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Mike Dahl : Hi, great, thanks for taking my questions. First one are to start with a question around kind of pricing power and the momentum and gross margins. I think Bob you talk about the potential for margins to improve as the year goes on. I'm not sure if that was still within the construct of the full year guidance that you're giving or suggesting that there could be upside from there. But as a starting point, could you talk about just the pricing power that you've seen? Maybe if you can give kind of percentage of communities that you've been able to raise price, any sense of magnitude and how that compares year-on-year over the past few months? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. Hey, Mike, just to clarify, that improvement was included in the guide, not outside the guide. So that's just reflecting that the range for the year actually goes a little bit higher than what we prepared for the first quarter. In terms of pricing power, I think if you look at our ASP, during the quarter, it's roughly flat on an aggregate basis. But you've actually got a decrease in the entry level, which is really a reflection of the types of assets we're providing there. There's actually \u2013 if there's any pricing, real pricing power in the market, I think it's there and I think it has been for probably the last year or two. We showed about 4% up on the move-up and active adult, so I think there isn't a real substantive change in the product we're delivering. But I think that gives you some insight into what the pricing power is around that mix always matters where the markets, it comes from all that. But on balance, I would say you've got more power to price in the entry level, although they are price sensitive. So there's a limit to how far you can push that. But we're seeing prices holding go up a little bit in the balance of the business. Ryan Marshall : Yeah, and Mike, the only other thing that I'd add to that is I think with the strength that you're seeing on the volume side, and we're starting to see some reduced inventory levels. I think certainly that would create an environment where all of the builders will have more pricing power. The thing that I think you'll see certainly us and all builders be cautious with is the affordability equation. We all saw what happened kind of in the back half of '18 when affordability became challenged and so pricing is one of the key levers in that mix, and I think we'll want to pay attention to that. Mike Dahl : Okay, thanks for that. And second question. Just another follow up on ICG and, Ryan, I appreciate that there are some things that you don't want to get into in terms of the details, but did want to press again on just \u2013 since you'll continue to have ICG serve its external customer base, what is the true differentiation to Pulte of owning the assets? Is it just the first hand learnings you've discussed or was this maybe more of a situation where you were an existing customer and had you not taken this position you could have lost access to them as a supplier or any other dynamic at play that could just kind of explain why this ends up being differentiating for you versus as others have question just having this be more of a partnership, but still a traditional kind of customer relationship. Ryan Marshall : Yeah, I think the opportunity here, Mike is really twofold. Number one, we see it as a great opportunity to partner with the founders to speed up the innovation moving from the current version of frame shell into some of the more advanced manufacturing techniques. So that's something that we've been talking about, you've heard us talk about really for the last two or so years that we think there's a tremendous opportunity there. And then the other piece is with 80% of our closings coming out of our commonly managed plant portfolio. We see this opportunity really applying to other parts of our business besides just you know what it's going to provide in the North Florida market. So that's something that we think working with the founders of ICG we can really benefit from and other parts of the country. The biggest reason Mike and I can't overemphasize this enough, this is about labor. We have been talking about labor shortages in this industry for the last 10 years, give or take. There doesn't seem to be anything that's going to structurally change the availability of labor. And so the only logical off ramp that we see to that is getting more efficient. And one of the avenues that we think is the easiest \u2013 or the most easily accessible off ramp is to truly have a housing operation that can benefit from offsite production. And we see the unlock that it gives us on the tight labor supplies as a huge benefit. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. John Lovallo : Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions. The first one on ICG and I think this is an incredible opportunity. And frankly, we see this is the future of home building. So I think this is an excellent move on your part. But ICG looks like they have the ability to deliver a complete fully integrated offsite solution. I mean, building information modeling, component manufacturing, installations, et cetera. And it looks like that you're taking kind of more of a piecemeal approach here just to start with some more prefab parts instead of going for the full solution. So I guess the question is, is this just being a little bit conservative on the onsite here and how quickly could you kind of pivot in the Jacksonville market to really deliver a fully integrated off site solution. Ryan Marshall : Hey, John, it's Ryan. We haven't given that level of detail yet. But I think what you highlight is what the real opportunity is. And that's certainly what we're focused on. As I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks, the level of innovation that it was \u2013 that was existing inside of ICG is one of the things that made it really attractive. So to your point, they have design services, or manufacturing precision components, we've got the ability to assemble those precision components with the onsite labor. And so the next logical step is some incremental investment. And then to kind of systematize in a way that you can do it in a volume type setting. And so, that's what the opportunity is and certainly what we're squarely focused on. John Lovallo : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just more of a housekeeping item here, the gross margin in the quarter, I think you guys had highlighted California incentives, warranty in inventory impairments. Anywhere you can kind of bucket the impact in the quarter from each of those? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, I wouldn't, because none of them are individually significant. If we get, they were we would have walked it through them. I would characterize the total of it as being somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 basis points of margin impact on the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys, good morning. Nice quarter and congrats on the acquisition. Ryan Marshall : Thanks Alan. Alan Ratner : My first one on ICG, just hearing your comments about some of the things that were the future where you can see this going and especially the closed panels with the windows and the plumbing and the electrical et cetera already pre-installed. One thing that we typically hear from builders is a reason why perhaps that hasn't become more main stream is the very high transportation costs associated with that bringing those products to the job site as well as breakage. I mean, I know builders even back in the 80s and 90s were experimenting with that stuff, installing windows and things. So is there anything that ICG has done that kind of is cracked the code to make that process more efficient and affordable from a building perspective that the math actually makes sense now, or is that just something that you think you've got the right team in place to pursue that, but perhaps they're not quite there yet? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. Alan thanks for the question. I appreciate it. As we mentioned today, what's coming out of ICG are the wall panels, the floor cassettes, and manufacturer trusses, we think there's an opportunity to go to the closed wall panels inclusive of windows, electrical, plumbing, et cetera. Work and investment has got to be done on that. I think you highlight the challenge that applies to all off site manufacturing not just kind of this second stage and its transportation. And so what that means is that you've got to have enough volume within a relatively close proximity such that the transportation costs don't offset the savings that you get from building those components in a more efficient way. So work to be done, investment to be done to figure that out, it has been done in other places in other applications. And so we think that the ability to do it is there. And then I think the next logical question is, well, why is this time going to be different? And it goes back to the question that I answered a few back which is labor and we just don't see labor rates going in a direction that will challenge the efficiencies that are gained from the manufacturing environment, which has happened in the past, but because of what I think is going to be a persistent shortage of labor, we really view this as a as a new opportunity to do something different. Alan Ratner : Got it, that's helpful, Ryan and second question, maybe for Bob, I'm just kind of thinking about the capital allocation, thinking at this point here. Your net debt to cap is at the lowest level we've seen in many years. And at the same time buybacks decelerated this quarter and for the year we're down fairly meaningfully from the prior few years. So how are you thinking about the balance sheet, the capital allocation at this point? Is there another kind of use of that cash that's being earmarked at this point? Or is it a function of where the stock prices and any commentary you can give there? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, it's going to sound a little bit redundant and boring, but it's kind of the same playbook we've been working from for the last several years. We pulled every lever this year, we bought stock, we increased our dividend, we retired some debt, we've invested in the business, we've indicated we'll be investing more this year, obviously, we've got an investment we just made an ICG and I think you'll continue to see all of those things be in our windshield. We obviously expect pretty strong cash generation in fiscal '20. What we've highlighted and been consistent with I think is we'll report the news on the share repurchase activity. But I think any and all of those are still front of mine, but nothing new or different to report beyond that. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Jack Micenko : Hi, good morning. First one, a little bit bigger picture for Ryan, thinking about this pivot for the entry level, and it seems this may be occurring a little bit faster than maybe you'd expected the success or the uptick. On the entry level side, you've got a real gamut of competition, you've got bare bones product, you've got everything included on the other end and then somewhere between you've got build order curious how you see Pulte really positioning and competing an entry level or product standpoint, as that business gets to be a bigger part of your mix? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, good morning, Jack. I appreciate the question. You're going to see us play on the higher end of the entry level price point. We have made some modifications to our typical built to order model and you heard that in Bob's prepared comments that we are building more specs in that business, to kind of meet the demand. That's there and so you saw a little bit of an uptick in our specs as a percentage of total inventory. And it's largely reflective of more specs in that entry level business. We are limiting the choice within our Centex model to drive some of the efficiencies that were in turn passing on to the consumer which really creates the affordability in the value that this first time buyer desire. So less choice, less ability to customize, but you're getting a really nice home and a lot of home for the money. And we think that's where the magic is. We'll continue to deliver the great customer experience, the high quality, the quality location of communities and I think all of our brands have been known for. I don't think you'll \u2013 well you won't see us probably go with the bare bones model the really small square footage model we just don't think that's part of the offering that we give to the consumer. Jack Micenko : Okay, thanks for that. And then the five points of pivot, given the uptick that you've seen and I think last quarter, you said that the margins in the entry were healthy or perhaps the move does that five point number expand? Are you leaving the door open for that to expand or you can say hey, look at we want to be a balanced business? And a third of the book is all we really want on the entry side. Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Jack. I think that the key message that I'd emphasize is we want a balanced business. I think you'll see it maybe it may go down a few points, it may go up a few points as opportunities arise. Our overall focus is going to continue to be the drive through cycle return on investment within the residential housing space. And so as we see trends emerge, we'll certainly take opportunities where they present themselves. But with the focus on being more balanced, I don't think you're going to see us place outsized bets in anticipation of some future trend. So we're pretty close to probably where we want to be, is probably the message that I leave with you. And as far as margins go to your other question, we like the margin profile that we're getting out of the entry level space. They're attractive margins. And it's really reflective of what Bob shared, which is, that's the place where we've seen the ability to get some price expansion. What I would emphasize Jack to the comment I made a minute ago about our focuses on return. We really look at the underwriting that business is the same as we look at move-up and the same as we look at active adult. So certainly gross margins are part of the story, but the real prize is return on invested capital. And we look at all of our consumer segments the same when it comes to return. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Ken Zener : Good morning, gentlemen. So your entry level, few years ago people were so concerned around the Del Webb, you seem to be putting that to rest. My question is this, if you're moving in entry, because that's where demand is, it makes sense. You're building more spec homes. Why is that approach given your hesitancy to do it in other categories? What is the risk return that you're seeing there? Is it because you're controlling more labor like some other builders have talked to? Is it that \u2013 what is it that gets you over that risk profile that you have for your other categories in short? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Ken its Ryan. Risk is just part of it. It's really about value in the eyes of the consumer. And so as we've looked at what the consumers willing to pay for, we believe that we're more efficient, more profitable, and manage risk better with the move-up and active adult buyer when they get the opportunity to choose the things that they value. And that's part of our strategic pricing model that is contributed to the margin profile that we have today that we're very proud of. We think with this entry level consumer, they value different things and affordability and access is probably the biggest driver. And so by limiting the amount of choice that we give, building a few more specs, having those homes quicker to deliver because this buyer in theory is coming out of an apartment. They just operate on a little bit different buying cycle than our move-up and our active adult buyer. And so it's less about risk and more about maximizing value and giving the consumer the things that they want and need. Ken Zener : I understand and think it's a good move. Second question, could you expand a little bit since you mentioned it as a gross margin drag California? Could you just talk about it being north south, coastal inland et cetera? Just give us your perspective since that was something you called out specifically. Thank you very much. Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Ken I think California as a whole it's been \u2013 the secret has been a drag and it's had \u2013 it's been a tougher selling environment for really the last 12 months, south and north, coastal and inland. In order of severity, I think northern California coastal probably being the hardest hit and the slowest. It also happens to be the place where we're starting to see some strength start to come back into the market. And so we're cautiously optimistic as we've got a very strong business or a nicely positioned business in Northern California in the Bay Area in particular. So probably the drag more on discounts and incentives that had to be \u2013 that were given to continue to sell homes in Northern California or the last 12 months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Truman Patterson : Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just wanted to follow up on the move-up market, get a little bit more color on that. Our field research recently has revealed a healthy move-up market, which I'll just say has been ahead of our expectations, quite frankly. But what do you really think is driving that? Is it lower rates kind of breaking up the prior rate lock? Are you starting to see the leading edge in the millennials purchase in earnest in the move up market? Really what do you think is driving that improvement? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, I think like everything else, it is the health of the economy, first and foremost, so you've got wage inflation, you have relatively slower price appreciation, there's \u2013 rate certainly helps if it's benefiting, so all those things coupled together. One of the earlier questions talked about sort of the big move for a lot of the builders to the entry level, which has to a degree than doubt, the competitive set. So supply is in pretty good shape, both from a new build perspective and we've got a healthy supply in just about every market where we're operating today in terms of days on market for resale, which is our biggest competitor. So I think all those things together have lent themselves to a pretty nice business for us at 29% absorption increase, 4% price appreciation is pretty nice. So we like the business and I'll parent what Ryan said earlier, it's the reason we're not making a big bet one way or the other. We think through time being able to serve in each of the markets where we operate that of consumers that are there and it's going to be different, for instance, in some parts of Florida than what it is in some parts of the Midwest, right, so that \u2013 we're looking at each market and investing to serve a balanced portfolio in the market where we're operating. Truman Patterson : Okay, okay. Absolutely agree with that. On the cost inflation outlook for 2020, I know you guys mentioned 1% stick and brick was likely to occur what you were expecting? Could you just break up your outlook for land, labor and materials? And whether or not you think this accelerates versus 2019? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, it's interesting. On the land side it's a competitive market. You've heard us say this before, it always is. I think you'll see certain parts of the country and certain asset classes being more competitive than others. But I think we're going to see continued land pressure. We see it in the land coming through and closing today. And I don't think land is on sale. In terms of the labor and materials, on the material side we've got a little bit of a tailwind in the first half of the year. reflective of the decreasing price of lumber and the lumber package in the back half of last year which will affect our closings now. But we've seen lumber tick up a little bit not bad, but a little bit so we think that'll moderate through the year. All the other real \u2013 other than concrete, which is always local to a market, we see a pretty benign material inflation rate. Labor is as you've heard us talk about and the reason for the ICG investment, always a little bit of a wild card. It's been better the last 12 months and so our expectation is that we don't see a lot of pressure on labor rate. That's going to vary by market. But obviously, we think about 1% up overall. Once again, that's going to largely be labor, just given the way that the materials market is behaving. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning guys. Jack and Truman got a couple of miles, so I just have one for you. With move-up looking better first time mix has moved that way the old cruise ship Del Webb stuff has kind of come off. I'm curious what you're thinking about inventory turns next couple of three years, how important that metric is to you? You turn about your image throughout one time of year by my numbers. Are you expecting that to pick up meaningfully? And how important is that metric to you all as a driver of return? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Carl, look it's a big driver of return. And so I think the way that we look at inventory turns is breaking down what do you get on the house side and what do we get on the land side, with 80 some odd percent of our balance sheet being in land, that's the lever that can really move the needle on overall inventory turns. And it's a big reason why you've heard us talk about doing shorter duration land deals with more options because it drives right at the heart of the inventory turns equation. So the hope would be that we can continue to grow that, as we roll in more options as we roll off some of the cruise ship Del Webb's that you mentioned we'd look for opportunity to accelerate our land inventory turn. On the house side, that's a balance between really cycle time, how much labor is available and delivering a high quality product. And I think it's another reason why we've made the investment in ICG, is because it speaks to all of those. You've got an opportunity to build with more precise components that are sitting out in the rain and the snow. You've got the ability of the BIM modeling and some of the technology that factors into that. And we think we can cut cycle time as well. So we think there's an opportunity to kind of pull all the levers there with more efficient labor, higher quality materials, being more cost efficient. So we think there's a lot of goodness. Carl Reichardt : We'd appreciate that, Ryan. Thanks. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that's all the questions \u2013 the time for questions that we have today. So I'd like to turn the call back to Jim Zeumer for some closing remarks. Jim Zeumer : Great, we appreciate everybody's time this morning. We're certainly available over the remainder of the day for any follow up questions and we look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session  [Operator instructions]. I will now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead Sir. Jim Zeumer : Thank you, Joanne and good morning. I want to welcome you to PulteGroup's first quarter earnings call but sadly most of the conversations will be about the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In that regard, I certainly hope that you are all well and staying safe. Today's call is a little different given we have PulteGroup participants located in number of locations. So I apologize in advance for any technical difficulties we may encounter. Joining me here and in appropriate social distance are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; and Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Joining us remotely are Jim Ossowski, Senior VP of Finance. And I am pleased to welcome Debra Still, President and CEO of PulteGroup Financial Service, who is dialing in from Denver. We thought it would be helpful to have Debra available to answer questions about our mortgage operations and overall mortgage market conditions. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later. Before I turn the call over to Ryan, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Jim and good morning. Before I begin let me offer my thoughts and prayers to everyone on the call today and in the communities in which PulteGroup operates. I sincerely hope that you and your families are well and are managing through the challenges created by COVID-19. I also want to acknowledge and say thank you to our nation's healthcare workers and first responders who have been remarkable in fighting the onsite of this disease. Given the devastating effects COVID-19 has had across the country I am going to focus my comments on the company's specific impacts and our operational responses. Bob will then discuss some of the key numbers within our first quarter results. As well as some factors to consider as you think about our business going forward. COVID-19, it's probably best to go back to the beginning. Well, that seems like a life time ago it really only has been six to eight weeks, more specifically PulteGroup and the broader housing industry entered 2020 with tremendous momentum and strong buyer demand. And this is reflected in the 16% growth in orders that we reported for the first quarter compared with the prior year. Our reported Q1 order growth, however, is not reflective of current market conditions. In the first quarter, net new orders were up more than 30% over the prior year for both January and February. It's now old news when I say that with the virus spreading rapidly and governments implementing shelter in place restrictions, home buying demands slowed dramatically as March progressed. To appreciate the magnitude of the slowdown in the first full week of March our net new order exceeded 800 homes. In the final full week this number dropped to just 140. As a result our March 2020 orders in total were down 11% from March of 2019. From orders being up 30 plus percent to being down 11% in just a few weeks is unlike anything we have experienced before. It's this level of volatility along with the dramatic economic slowdown and ongoing job loss that let us to withdraw our guidance for 2020 as indicated in our press release earlier today and we will not be providing any new guidance until condition stabilize. Given how the U.S. economic slowdown intensify as we moved into April, it is no surprise that housing demand has slipped even further. Through the first three weeks of the month we have sold approximately 920 homes on a gross basis excluding cancellations. The underlying trend is the buyer traffic to our website and in turn our communities has decreased materially. This is obviously a very small sample size. But directionally, we are running a little below 50% of the pace in the first quarter with the most recent trends generally stable to up slightly. While the impact of COVID-19 was hard and fast PulteGroup is fortunate to have an experienced management team throughout our organization. In other words, we have been through slowdowns before such that we can and are responding quickly. A cadence of functional meetings, Skype calls to be exact, at every level of our operations were organized and are ongoing. Based on real time insights supplied by frontline managers we are routinely adjusting sales, construction, purchasing, mortgage and other functional practices to the rapidly changing market conditions. Important information from these division level meetings has been routinely shared via a daily call with my senior team that reviews everything from customer traffic and sales, to land investments and conditions in the mortgage market. Think of my leadership calls as a virtual war room in which we can quickly assess ongoing events and adjust business tactics as required. It's vital that information flows both ways inside our organization. We can quickly disseminate critical data and decisions back into our operations via internal to the newly built section within our intranet. This section also acts as a data repository for key policies and materials as well as robust and growing warehouse of best practice videos. These videos cover everything from the direct marketing and managing a great virtual house tour to conducting an efficiently option selection meeting online and even closing a home purchase remotely. I won't take you through the daily, even hourly evolution of our business practices but I will share with you how we are operating the business today. To help ensure the health and safety of our customers and employees we are working remotely and leveraging available technology platforms to enable virtual interactions with our home buyers from walking computer-generated floor plans and taking a lot on our interactive community maps to selecting options and applying for and ultimately closing the mortgage. At this point, we're able to effectively do everything remotely. In fact, I fully expect we will be integrating a number of these new practices into our selling processes even as we move back to more normal operating conditions. I think our millennials and active adult buyers in particular will appreciate having more options in terms of how they interact with the home buying process. For potential home buyers who do want to visit a model and meet in person such meetings were permitted are by appointment only. Appointments ensure we can control the number of attendees and enforce social distancing as well as to provide time for us to implement our enhanced cleaning protocols. Moving from sales to construction. We are working closely with our trades to confirm compliance with national and local guidelines relating to social distancing and on-site health and personal hygiene practices. Construction has been designated an essential service across all of our markets except for Michigan, Pennsylvania, the state of Washington and key municipalities in Northern California. We have also notified our homebuyers that we will be providing warranty service for emergency situations only until this crisis has passed. Finally, as an extension of protecting the health and reducing risks for entire team for the end of March, we made the decision to guarantee employment for all PulteGroup employees through the end of April. We wanted to make sure we provided a sense of security, so our employees could focus on their families and on taking care of our customers. Given the severity of the economic slowdown, we\u2019ve recognized that staffing actions will be needed to better align overhead expenses given the slowdown in housing demand and we are planning for such but this decision is consistent with PulteGroup's employee first culture. Beyond our people, given the challenging operating environment and economic uncertainties resulting from COVID-19, our focus is on protecting the company's liquidity and closely managing our cash flows. Bob will review details shortly but let me provide a few high-level comments on the actions that we have taken today. On the land side, we are working closely with our existing land sellers to postpone the purchase of land parcels currently under contract. Land sellers understand what's happening in the market, so conversations typically take a collaborative approach. I am extremely pleased to say that we have been successful in delaying well over 90% of the lots scheduled for purchase in the near term. We would hope to have similar success as and when we need to deal with contracted land positions scheduled to close in the future. In the rare situations where we have been unable to agree on some form of extension with the land seller, we have walked away from the lots and our pre-acquisition expense. In the first quarter, these charges amounted to only $4 million. In a similar fashion we are working to intelligently slow land development such that it is more appropriately aligned with the current sales environment. At this point our approach is focused on delaying development rather than outright mothballing communities. The latter may become a tactic depending on how the slowdown plays out but for now we want to continue turning assets even at a reduced rate. We've also implemented strategies to limit the amount of capital we are investing in vertical construction. This includes contacting backlog customers and reconfirming their status before beginning to construction of that sold unit. Having said that between our existing spec starts and an elevated cancellation rate, we have spec units in production that we are also moving on to a slower track. At quarter end we had a total of about 3,100 specs in the pipeline of which almost 40% were early enough in the build cycle that we are able to suspend further construction. Depending upon the exact stage of production, construction on the remaining spec units will be held, slowly advanced or completed on schedule and then sold. Given the actions that we've taken to adjust land and house spend we'll be able to postpone several hundred million dollars in cash outflows by effectively idling parts of our business, we can maintain strong liquidity while positioning our operations to meet buyer demand. However, it develops over the remainder of 2020 and into the next year. It's hard to envision a more difficult operating environment than what we are experiencing today and I don't even want to try to sugarcoat it. That being said given the way that we have been running the business over the past decade I do believe that PulteGroup is very well positioned both operationally and financially to navigate the challenging and volatile market conditions we'll face until the impacts of the pandemics recede. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for first quarter operating and financial results. Bob? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks Ryan and good morning everyone. Before starting my review let me reiterate that we have withdrawn our previous guidance relating to our 2020 results and we will not be providing any new guidance at this time this decision was driven by the dramatic impact Corona virus has had on unemployment, GDP and consumer confidence the result of which is that it's impossible for us to forecast how markets and buyers will respond when conditions ultimately begin to improve. We are optimistic that buyer demand has the ability to rebound but there's too much uncertainty at this time for us to provide meaningful guidance. As Ryan indicated given the dramatic change in demand dynamics and overall market conditions, I'm not going to walk through our first quarter statements in the usual detail. I will however discuss Q1 results on a high level business to operate over the next couple of quarters. Looking at the income statement, home sale revenues in the first quarter increased 14% to $2.2 billion. Higher revenues in the period were driven by a 16% increase in closings for 5373 homes, partially offset by a 2% decrease in average sales price to $413,000. The decrease in average sales price for the quarter was driven primarily by changes in the product and geographic mix of homes closed. Product mix continues to benefit from the expansion of our first-time business which increased to 33% of our closings in the quarter, up from 25% last year. In addition, 42% of our closings came from move up buyers and the remaining 25% came from active adult buyers. In the prior year 48% of closings were move up and 27% were active adult. At 33% of closings, we have achieved our stated goal of having first-time represent about one third of our business. Given our growing investment in first-time and the fact that it was experiencing the strongest demand prior to the slowdown. First time could increase slightly in the percentage of our overall business going forward. As Ryan noted, orders for the first quarter were up 16% to 7,495 homes. By buyer group first-time orders were up 31% to [3,345] homes and active adult was at 5% to 1,674 homes. Driven in part we ended the quarter with 12,629 homes in backlog which is up 20% over the first quarter of last year. Given the strong order rates over the past several quarters, we ended the Q1 with 12,088 homes under construction which represents an increase of 17% over last year. It was driven entirely by sold homes as spec production on an unit base [indiscernible] and represented only 26% of homes under construction. Consistent with Ryan's comments we had curtailed new spec starts for the time being and are identifying opportunities to efficiently and safely pause construction spec units already in production. Ideally, this would entail holding units at the foundation stage but we can hold after they are dried in if needed. While we are not providing guidance in regard to expected quarterly or annual results I think it's useful to share information on backlog performance and the current state of our construction operations. First to-date buyers have wanted to close relative to the size of our backlog we are seeing minimal cancellations with most as you would expect driven by job loss results from the coronavirus. Through the first week [indiscernible] we've had 360 backlog of units cancel which represents only 3% of homes in backlog. Based on these numbers and our experiences to-date it's clear that our home buyers are willing and even anxious to get into the safety of their new home. Second, our trades want to work. We remain in close communication with our trades to coordinate activities and ensure we are operating in compliance with all work rules and safety guidelines. As we have had to adjust the cadence of start and also production timeline ongoing communication with our trade base is critical to maintaining production efficiency. And third, we are having to proactively and intelligently manage the supply chain. The initial challenge is adjusting to any disruption in materials and our components from China. We were fortunate and that we had recently conducted an extensive analysis that supply chain in response to the U.S.-China tariff issues in 2019. More recently however, we are dealing with the closures of U.S. plants as a result of state or municipal restrictions to keep people at home. The U.S.-based plants typically have less inventory in the supply chain so adjustments have to be made very quickly. For commodities and mechanicals like plumbing, electrical and HVAC, we can usually swap to an upgrade or identify comparable product manufactured by another supplier. It's much more difficult when the delay involves products such as cabinets, countertops and appliances where colors and styles can be difficult to match. In these instances we are working with our customers to identify suitable alternatives or we may simply have to wait extra days until the required product becomes available. As of today's call delays across the enterprise are relatively minor but they can be disruptive within a specific community or market and may cause delays and completing impacted homes. Continuing with my review of our first quarter results, gross margin for the quarter was 23.7% which is up 30 basis points over the last year and up 90 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2019. Gross margin exceeded not only last year but our guidance for the period. In addition to benefits resulting from the mix of homes closed our improved gross margin reflects the prior strength of housing demand and our ability to capture incremental pricing opportunities as incentives decreased to 3.6% in the quarter. This is down 40 basis points from the first quarter of last year and 20 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019. Broadly, we would generally tell you that prices have been holding. Unlike the back half of [indiscernible] affordability the issues today relate to the inability to leave your home, job loss or simply fear, price does not solve these issues. Price is also benefiting from low levels of new and existing home inventory on the market. That being said spectrum in the industry's production pipeline are rising and cancellations are resulting in inventory build-up in a number of markets across the country [indiscernible] which often lead us to solve a price over pace but we need to continue selling homes and we will be competitive in the market. Our SG&A expenses in the first quarter was $264 million or 11.9% of home sale revenues. This is a 110 basis points lower than the first quarter of last year in which SG&A expenses $253 million or 13% of home sale revenues. The improvement in overhead leverage was driven by the volume growth realized in the quarter. As Ryan discussed, given the ongoing erosion in home buyer demand witnessed across the country we recognize that we will need to make adjustments to our organization. Planning is already in process that will result in furloughs and layoffs in addition to other general cost reductions needed in order to right-size our operations. Moving on, you will see a line for goodwill impairment in our first quarter income statement. Given the significant decline in equity market valuations, we determined that an event driven impairment test on a goodwill associated with our January 2020 acquisition of ICG was appropriate. This test resulted in an impairment totaling $20 million. This impairment was not the result of any factors specific to ICG's operations but rather reflects the broad-based declines in the market capitalizations of publicly traded construction companies during the period. Having now worked with ICG since the closing we're even more excited about the opportunities we see for such offsite production. Of course accounting guidelines don't factor in our excitement but simply evaluate the recoverability of goodwill based on objectively verifiable market data and as we all know the equity markets have been under stress in recent weeks. Looking at our financial services operations, the business generated pre-tax income of $20 million, an increase of 58% over prior year pre-tax income of $12 million. This year's higher pre-tax income reflects an improved margin environment, higher loan buyers consistent with growth in our home-building operations as well as higher tax rate. Mortgage capture rate increased to 87% in the quarter from 80% last year. I would note that given disruptions in the national mortgage market caused by COVID-19, we did have to write down the value of our mortgage servicing rights in the quarter, reported financial services pre-tax income for the first quarter includes this adjustment. Completing my comments on our income statement, our first quarter income tax expense was $60 million or an effective tax rate of 22.8% compared with $50 million for an effective tax rate of 23% last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than last year and our recent guidance as we recorded benefits related to equity compensation. In summary for the first quarter our net income was $204 million or $0.74 per share which is an increase from prior year net income of $167 million or $0.59 per share. Turning now to discussion of our balance sheet, cash flows and uses of capital we ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash which is up from $1.3 billion at the end of 2019. Our increased cash position primarily reflects our decision to draw $700 million from our revolving credit facility in March. Given the dramatic decline in global economic conditions and the uncertainty of future demand trends we drew on our facility in an abundance of caution. The incremental net interest expense related to these borrowings which will be reflected in interest expense is approximately a million dollars per month so it's low-cost insurance as we move through the next few months.  In the first quarter we invested $619 million in land acquisition and development. On a sequential basis this is a decrease of $152 million from the fourth quarter as we are working quickly to adjust land spend to match the current operating environment. Land acquisition spend in the quarter amounted to only $219 million, our lowest quarterly investment since 2014 and will likely decline further as we work to defer future land purchases. In the first quarter we repurchased 2.8 million common shares for $96 million on average price of $33.86 per share. As business conditions eroded during this month of March, we elected to stop our repurchase activities. At this time we have suspended share repurchases consistent with our focus on conserving capital. In conclusion, we entered this period of economic uncertainty in a position of strength. Our home building operations have proven to be efficient and highly profitable and we maintain ample liquidity. We're operating in a period of unprecedented job loss and economic contraction but I'm confident in our ability to manage through the turmoil and successfully exit to the other side. Let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Bob highlighted that we are dealing with this economic crisis from the position of strength. We've put ourselves in this position by operating a highly profitable and high returning home building business for a number of years. The strong operating results we delivered in this first quarter are consistent with the strategies and tactics against which we have consistently operated. By the time we get through the challenges of COVID-19 we will have adapted to a lot of changes. What won't have changed however is the strategic and disciplined approach we take to running our business which has delivered great financial results in the past. Our work to maintain an exceptional culture and a committed team doesn't change. Our ability to underwriting develop outstanding communities, design to meet customer needs while delivering high returns doesn't change. Our focused on delivering superior quality homes and outstanding customer service doesn't change. So while a lot will change, the fundamentals that have made PulteGroup successful remain solidly in place. In closing, before we open the call to questions, I want to say thank you to our employees and our suppliers who have been absolutely amazing throughout these past few weeks. In a period of heightened risks and fears where and when appropriate you have been on-site and operating in our communities, as required you have quickly adapted to working from home and servicing our customers from a socially acceptable distance. And through it all you have maintained an upbeat attitude and a can-do spirit. It has been impressive to watch. Let me turn the call back to Jim. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thanks Ryan. Now we are prepared to open the call for questions, so we can get as many questions as possible during the remaining time in this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question one follow-up. Now I will ask Joanne to explain the process and open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Alan Ratner : Hey guys. Good morning. Hope everyone is doing well within the organization and your families and thank you for all of your commentary this morning. My first question if I could and maybe this is directed for Deb but I'd love to hear and dig in a little bit about what's going on in the mortgage markets today? I know the headlines have been kind of fast and furious about tightening in terms of credit overlays being instituted by a number of investors and lenders and I know there's a lot of disruption on the servicing side as well and I'm just curious what you've seen over the last couple weeks in terms of your ability to originate loans, to sell loans, sales servicing rates and taking that a step further, where are the current standards today that your originating for your buyers? Ryan Marshall : Morning Alan. Thanks for the question. There's certainly a lot there. We are doing well and I hope that everybody at Zelman is healthy as well. Maybe let me just start with some real broad overview comments and then I'll turn it over to Deb. Our Pulte Financial Services team has been absolutely outstanding. We do have very good liquidity. The operations of the mortgage company have really continued with minimal interruption. There certainly are some challenges there but I really do believe that Deb and her team have effectively helped to navigate those. So with that I'll turn it to Deb and she can provide some additional commentary. Debra Still : Sure. Thanks Ryan and good morning Alan. Yes, so certainly disruptions. We've seen a lot of headlines, I think one of the things that is important to note is not all disruptions apply to all lender business models and so for Pulte, the majority, for the majority of our loan programs Pulte Mortgage offers, we're working with the same investors. We're working with the same buyers of servicing that we've done business with for years. For Pulte Mortgage, we are looking to add additional investor partners for our government loans where the environment has gotten more restrictive than the conventional market and our strategy remains the same which is the seller loans in the secondary market and to sell our servicing. The jumbo market you read headlines that it may be frozen and while I think there's far fewer participants, we're partnering with several banks and several credit unions that are still buying our jumbo loans and providing us that liquidity. So I'll stop there and see if you want to go into more detail. Alan Ratner : Yes. No that's very helpful. Yes, I do have one or two follow-ups to that if I could. I guess on the government side it seems like that's where we've seen some FICO and DTI overlays put in place. I know some lenders have gone as high as 700, not going below that others are kind of more on the 60-80 range. So I guess the question is when you look at your book of business and you look at your backlog it seems like cancellations have been very modest. Are you still able to get a NFHA VA loan done at a call at 640-660 FICO and what percentage of your business actually falls into that criteria right now? Debra Still : Yes. So we still have credit available certainly at the 640-660 range. Some investors are requiring loan level price adjustments for those credit scores but for the most part there's decent liquidity at that level Alan, much like our product mix has been for many years FHA and VA together are about 20% of our book of business. Operator : Your next your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is now open. Jack Micenko : Good morning everyone. Hope everybody is well on your end. Ryan Marshall : Good morning Jack. Jack Micenko : Good morning. I think part of the silver lining here is, you're coming into this with a really-really strong backlog and so I guess first question I have is Ryan, what are the regional heads doing to preserve that backlog? Any kind of strategies there and then Deb what's the mortgage company doing proactively to kind of peel through that backlog? Is it a second set of eyes on the underwriting? Is it a closer touch on the employment status? Just kind of curious, how you guys are managing? There is a lot of forward revenue there and preserving that I would imagine is priority number one. Ryan Marshall : Yes Jack. Good morning. It's Ryan and we do really, we really do believe that the size of our backlog is a real benefit for us as we move through this crisis. The good news is the majority of that backlog made a buying decision prior to the effects and the impacts of COVID-19 and as Bob highlighted in detail, we've largely seen most of those buyers anxious and ready to move to the closing table. We've certainly done a lot of things in working with our Pulte Financial Services Partners inclusive of doing drive-by closings, where we've been able to sign the majority of the documents virtually and there's only a handful of things that need a wet signature and we've been able to do that without human interaction and contact which has been great. In terms of tactics that our operators are taking to preserve that backlog, we're really working with our buyers in a collaborative way to understand their specific needs in the cases of job loss and things like that. In some cases, we've had to take a cancellation and that's reflected in the numbers that Bob shared with you. Certainly, we've got great partnership with our mortgage company on a number of fronts and not only does that help minimize risk they provide just outstanding products and service. Our mortgage team has been able to give us insight into concentrations of customers that might fall into a particular industry but we are very careful not to violate any of the banking regulations that would prohibit the mortgage company from sharing specific buyer data. So those are a few of the things that we've been doing to manage the backlog. Jack Micenko : Okay. And then one for Bob. Looking at cash, stock a buyback slowing down the land spend, monetizing backlog, cash position probably balloons pretty significantly into year end. So assuming new recovery, how do you think about the cash, 12 months out I mean Ryan your comment sounded like prepared for the worst, hope for the best but you said looking the cash numbers $2.5 billion, $3 billion is kind of numbers, no debt coming due to 2021. If we get to the other side of this is just going to be buyback, is it going to be reaccelerate the land spend because the demand is there and you've got to catch up? How do you think about this is large likely cash positions into this year? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes Jack, thanks for the question and hopefully we are wrestling with that particular question. I think our view on this is we wanted to get as liquid as we could. We drew on our revolver just from a precautionary standpoint. So I think the first use of any cash would be as we get more comfortable with this we would seek to pay that down. You mentioned that we've got a maturity in March of next year not that far away that would be a pretty high priority for our cash depending on market conditions would we refinance it, I don't know it'll depend but other than that I think the process we will go through is no different than what we've been doing for the last five plus years, which is evaluating the opportunity to generate return from that cash. So if we think there's an opportunity in the land market obviously that would be a place where we place primary importance on investing. If we have excess capacity beyond that we're always thinking about repurchase activity. We've obviously stopped that as time goes by, we will revisit whether that's appropriate and we obviously pay a dividend. We'll be in the course of normal discussion with our board visiting what we do with that over time. So I think the answer is, isn't really any different but I would tell you obviously the first thing we would think about is the revolver and paying that down. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning everyone and hope everyone in the Pulte family, extended family are safe and healthy in this time. First question I had was, if I could try to get a little more clarity obviously appreciate it with regard to order trends in the last six weeks or so and obviously appreciate all the details that you've given. I think what a lot of people are thinking about is trying to parse out in terms of the orders and the fall-off in orders which markets and which segments maybe you've seen it the worst? You mentioned about a 50% decline in sales pace versus the first quarter in April. And so I was curious if there's any additional granularity you might have for us in terms of buy market which markets may be saw a greater drop-off and across your three major consumer segments where you saw it a little worse or better? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike good morning. What I would tell you is that, April started very slow as the majority of the country went into shelter-in-place type orders. Some markets very aggressive, late end of March, early part of April and then eventually you saw the entire country go into that mode. As our sales processes evolved and caught up to that we went to by appointment only for the protection of not only our sales team but also the customers and then we quickly adapted to a lot of virtual selling practices with virtual tours, heavy use of Microsoft teams do engage with customers where we could share documents and the various choices the buyer would have and what we saw as we move through April, each week we were doing more virtual appointments. Our team got more comfortable with it. I think buyers got more comfortable with it and so we were encouraged by that. We had, as I shared with you we had over 900 sales in April to-date which in this environment we're largely the entire country is still at home to be able to sell that many homes virtually, I think is a fairly decent result. We are starting to see some pretty positive trends in our traffic data just starting this week as we think more of the -- I think because more of the country is talking about reopening. We've seen certain states already take action to reopen and I think some of the understanding and the fears around COVID-19 is starting to subside. We're seeing some positive traffic trends which I think bodes well. In terms of consumer groups and segments, the one that I would tell you was probably down the most early as the Dell Webb consumer which I'm sure as you can appreciate is understandable. Number one, that's an aged demographic that is most susceptible and at the highest risk to the virus and so that's a buyer group that I think was early on the most cautious and probably continues to be. There also a buyer group that's heavily influenced by volatility in the equity markets which we know there was plenty of that in the back half of March. As that's stabilized and as the virus starts to come under control we started to see that buyer group rebound. It's a buyer group that's got great liquidity. They've got strong wealth. They're not as dependent on the job market and so we're actually starting to see some nice trends from that group. What I tell you though Mike is every buyer group is susceptible to the impacts of this virus. I don't think there's any one group that is going to be untouched. They may go through different phases as the impacts to the economy move through the entire system. Michael Rehaut : Thanks Ryan. I appreciate that answer. I guess for the second question, maybe if I could sneak in slightly a two part. Number one you mentioned the virtual orders coming in. Of that 960, I was curious roughly what percent was able to be counted as an order without the customer even physically walking into the home and conversely you had mentioned in a prior question around the 360 cans in the first three weeks of April. I think primarily driven by job loss. I just wanted to try and get a sense again going back to the, I guess you want to call backlog scrubbing, if you feel like that 360 represents fully the initial job losses that we've seen across the country or if the tension there might be an additional portion of the backlog susceptible to the recent unemployment trends? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Mike, in terms of how many of the April sales we are able to do everything virtually I don't have that number at my fingertips. I would tell you it was the lion share of the process was done virtually. There are some buyers that maybe they wanted to do at least one on-site visit. It wasn't required however and we were set up operationally that the entire process could be handled virtually. So we feel really good about that. In terms of the cancellations there's some number of cancellations that we take in a given month just as a normal order, a normal course of business and that's reflected in what is our kind of normal cancellation rate for those that we've seen in April, I would tell you probably the majority were COVID related in some way shape or form. Most of those kind of relating to job loss or family health reasons. As we move kind of through this, yes I think there's certainly continued risk depending on how deep and how prolonged the downturn is and then what the recovery looks like. So the job loss or the unemployment claims today were a little better than they were last week but at over 4 million it's still a pretty big number and we'll ultimately just need to see how that plays out over the coming weeks and months. Operator : Your next question comes the line of Steven Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Steven Kim : Yes. Thanks a lot Ryan and team and thanks for all the information thus far, sounds like you are doing as great a job as one could expect in this environment. There were some very interesting things that you mentioned with respect to how things have been evolving very recently and so far in April and I just wanted to knit a couple of things together that you've said and just sort of get your overarching view as to how the demand picture looks. I think you indicated that when you gave your numbers for cancellations and the sales you were doing obviously it seemed like it picked up relative to the final week of March in terms of the gross orders and then on top of that your cancellation rate if I were to extrapolate that out to a full quarter, looks like you're talking about a backlog can rate of maybe 12% or something like that for a full quarters worth, which is like less than a half of what you saw during the global financial crisis. You said price isn't really the issue and people are wanting to move in. So with all of that said, I'm curious as to how you think this buyer pullback compares to other demand pull backs that we've seen? Usually, for instance when you see demand pull back there is kind of an immediate price response sort of a demand for that and it doesn't seem like that's happening today and you've seen a pickup in traffic even before the states have opened up. So it feels to me almost as if there's like, like a fire that's gone dormant because I had a blanket thrown over it and then the blanket gets removed there may be a spike in demand and I'm wondering if you would be ready to capture that and if you think that that's, even something that's worth preparing for or if it's more important to sort of be defensive in the case that things get worse and linger. So my question is a little bit of complicated, I apologize but how are you seeing the demand potential just spike in the next let's say month or two as things actually do open up? And what are some of the things that you're doing to position yourself to capture that if in fact that happened? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Steven it's a great question and I would tell you, we don't have a better crystal ball than anybody else does in terms of what the recovery ultimately looks like. Is it a U? Is it V? Is it an L? Is it a square root recovery? There's a ton of theories out there. We're looking and studying all of them. I think you made a couple of interesting points that I would tend to agree with buyer desire to own a home seems to be holding pretty strong and pretty steady and strong. The ultimate question I think is going to be when does the economy start to reopen and how deep and prolonger the job losses. We know that jobs are a critical component of a home buyer being able to make the decision to move and do something different. If the job losses can be minimized and the folks that have been furloughed or able to be called back I think that bodes well for housing. Different than I think other housing downturns typically there has been a buildup of supply which we don't have right now. There's not a buildup on the resale side. There's not a buildup on the new side and so I would tell you that's largely why we've seen price continue to hold. Bob's prepared remarks I think hit the nail right on the head which is, this is something that is being driven by partly fear, partly folks being at home and not being able to leave their home s and price doesn't necessarily solve that. And so I think what you've seen from the industry for the most part is there hasn't been a lot of discounting other than in a few places where we've seen some co-broke type incentives to move inventory that was finished. We haven't seen in the market broad-based price reductions on base pricing which I think is generally a positive. In terms of being opportunistic Steven I think our model of having a very large backlog that is over 12,000 at this point that puts us in a very good position assuming the cancellation rates remain where they're at and for clarity we're running at a level that we're 3% for the month of April. I think that translates into something a little less than the number that you quoted but we'll see kind of what that cancellation rate ultimately trends to for the full quarter. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Steven just to maybe further clarify that the cans, I think what you're going to see is based on the sales level that we're seeing today, gross and the cans against that 12,000 unit backlog, you will likely see an elevated cancellation rate in Q2 because you're going to have a reduced sales environment we've highlighted that sales are down, you have cans while they're not huge against the total backlog are going to be big against that relative number. So just, I heard you say that we might have a lower can rate in Q2 or net can rate is that will not be the case. Stephen Kim : Yes, I was referring to a backlog can rate. Just to hear because I think that's -- Bob O'Shaughnessy: Got it. Stephen Kim : Okay. So yes, that's great. Appreciate that. Sort of kind of follow up on that, I feel like it would be interesting to hear particularly that you're -- given your headquarter in Georgia, how you're planning on handling a reopening policy which probably won't be unified across the country and so I'm curious as to how whether Pulte would be adopting kind of a across the country kind of a policy or will it be determined locally. And I'm also curious if you could talk about this pricing issue, how your price release and an issue you have seen a lot of discounting. I'm curious is that whether you're actually seeing any desire on the part of the people who are buying, to actually in fact maybe upgrade, maybe are you seeing any increased demand for an extra bedroom let's say or maybe the home office and then lastly are you seeing, can you give us a sense for what percent of your buyers need to sell a home first and how that's factoring into the demand picture today? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Steven let me -- there's a lot there. Let me see if I can organize kind of my response. Stephen Kim : Yes, it was the reopening, the demand for extra maybe upgrades and then what percent need to sell a home first? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes. So in terms of reopening we are taking a coordinated effort from our corporate office and working with our regional heads and our division presidents in terms of how we reopen but it will be a customized approach by state, by market, even by sale center or by active community in some cases. So in most of the places where. Ryan Marshall : Well, let me back up we will not open anywhere until we're permitted by state and/or local regulation. That being said we will open on the timeframe that we believe is appropriate for us once permitted by local regulation. So in Georgia, to your point starting this weekend a lot of the Georgia economy is starting to reopen, we will be taking a phased approach and how we reopen our corporate office as well as how we open our sales centers in Georgia. In terms of upgrading Steven, I think what you'll likely see is a lot of folks that have been maybe living in more confined spaces whether the apartments condos. My guess is you're going to see an elevated desire for maybe suburbia and having a little bit more space. I think most of our homes do come with the ability to have flex space and do things like home office's and I would absolutely see that being high on the list of things that buyers would want And finally as it relates to homes to sell, I don't know that's necessarily changed from what the historical trends were in talking with a number of resale agents that I know here locally as well as across the country. There's actually kind of a tight supply of good inventory on the resale market and so the feedback that I'm getting is if the home is priced properly and in good condition. They're actually selling and selling fairly quickly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is now open. John Lovallo : Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions and I hope everyone is well. First question Pulte and many of your competitors have talked about delaying land purchases which clearly makes sense. I'm wondering though are you anticipating any stress at the land developer level? Are developers still able to access capital at this point? Maybe any thoughts around that would be helpful. Ryan Marshall : Yes. It's a fair question. For the most part we are self developing John and so we are putting raw parcels under contract. For the larger developers we have not gotten any indication that they've got capital constraints. I think they like us are looking at the phasing of development. So phases might be a little bit shorter, might be delaying the next phase until we can work through the existing ones. So we haven't heard of a lot of noise in the market from folks that we have developed in relationships with everybody's focused on cash as you can well imagine but I think it's pretty coordinated at this point. John Lovallo : Okay. That's helpful and then, the labor challenges that some folks are seeing mostly smaller builders and some of the social distancing that's going on on job-sites, I mean do you get the sense that this could increase the demand or the interest for off-site building and with your ICG acquisition, have you guys seen increased inquiries into the business since COVID has hit? Ryan Marshall : Yes John. We're excited about ICG as Bob mentioned. We've now been operating with ICG for just over three months. We're more excited today than we were at the time of acquisition as we've started to incorporate ICG products and materials into our Jacksonville operation. It's really gone well. Just like we talked last quarter we really see the implementation and integration of off-site as being a long-term strategic move for the company to address what we really believe are fundamental shortages in labor overtime for the industry. My guess is that as social distancing practices will likely continue well into the future. I don't think this is a 30 or 60 day time frame. We're going to be working on social distancing, I think for a long time to come even better opportunity to take advantage of the labor efficiencies that are created by using off-site. So suffice to say, we were excited then. We're more excited now and we're looking forward to continuing to see that expansion through our operation over the coming years. Operator : Your next question comes in line of Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Truman Patterson : Hi good morning everybody and glad to hear you all are safe. So first question you all have a proprietary pricing tool that's really helped you achieve elevated gross margins. I'm just hoping you could shed some light on the existing markets pricing as I would imagine there's a lack of inventory that you mentioned. There's also a lack of foreclosures with forbearance which I think is going to help support the existing market pricing but have you seen any local market pricing that started to crack or rollover or are there any local metros that you're really watching near term? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Truman good morning. It's Ryan. I think we addressed in some of the prepared remarks. We've actually seen price hold pretty steady. The only pricing actions that we've really seen there's a few spots where certain builders have had an elevated level of spec inventory and in an effort to move those, they put some financing incentives in place or some elevated co-broke incentives which I think ultimately at the end of the day is more of an advertising mechanism as opposed to a price mechanism. So underlying values in this environment I think have held steady. We haven't seen broad-based discounting on to be built orders. I haven't necessarily even seen broad-based discounting on the resale side either. So knock on wood, we'd hope that that can hold. For the time being the results have been positive. Truman Patterson : Okay. Got you. So specifically no real local metros that have really started to crack or anything along those lines? Ryan Marshall : Correct. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you and then just hoping to get a bit of an overview on the broader land environment but really what I'm hoping to understand is whether you all are restructuring any of your options land deals and what those are starting to look like in those conversations and then also if you could look forward maybe one to two quarters what portion or magnitude of the option deals are possibly at risk of being written off? Ryan Marshall : Yes. It's interesting. There isn't any particular form or fashion just like the way we've built the land book it is negotiation with individual sellers and as we mentioned on the call to this point everybody understands we had very limited impact that we had highlighted $4 million in write offs of pre-acts and we've got a normal run rate of 2. If you think about it every quarter we usually have a couple of million dollars. So it was slightly elevated but not materially. So I think what that tells you is that the dialogue we're having with our sellers is constructive. In some cases we've deferred 30 days. In some cases we've deferred 60 days. In some cases 90 and I think we'll continue to evaluate it as we go forward. I don't know that there's any particular bucket of the contracts that we have in place today that are any more or less at risk than anything else quite honestly. The decision to move forward is going to be based on how we see the market and whether we get the return we are seeking from the investment we're making and we'll make those decisions candidly community by community. So we are working with all of the sellers and I talked about development spend, we're suggesting to folks, hey! don't put more money into it because we may need to wait a little while and they understand that. So on balance you never know where this is going to go because demand will dictate how we operate. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Truman the only thing I'd add to that is when we negotiate land transactions we underwrite the return as I think you well know, the two big variables in that are pace and price and we've talked to price in your first question which is largely held pretty consistent. Pace is the unknown and until we kind of come out of this recovery and we start to see how things recover that's what might ultimately kind of dictate what happens to underlying land values but we do believe based on the optionality that we've really worked to put into our land book over the last several years whereas well positioned as the company's ever been to create some real optionality and how our land book comes on to our balance sheet or how we ultimately purchase things over the coming months. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead sir. Jim Zeumer : Okay. Well, thank you Joanne. I apologize there were a few more questions we just didn\u2019t, we've run out of time on this call. We will certainly be available over the course of the day if you do have any other questions. We did run a little bit long. We want to provide as many comments as we could in our prepared script and hopefully answer as many questions as we could that way. Thank you for your time. Stay well and we'll look forward to speaking to you on the next call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Jim, and good morning. I am very pleased to report that the recovery in new home demand that we experienced over the course of the second quarter was nothing short of outstanding. Our second quarter results show a remarkable rebound in demand as April net new orders fell 53% from last year, only to see year-over-year orders increased 50% for the month of June. Led by strong demand among first-time buyers, we saw meaningful improvement across all buyer groups and geographies as the quarter advanced. This improvement culminated in June orders increasing 77% for first time, 48% for move up and 21% for active adult over June of last year. The rebound in demand during the quarter resulted in our aggregate second quarter orders declining only 4% from last year. We are very encouraged by the fact that the momentum of this dramatic recovery continues as demand has remained strong through the first few weeks of July. Improving industry dynamics in combination with disciplined business practices allowed us to drive meaningful gains in our operating results and financial position. These gains include revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved overhead leverage, which when coupled with our prudent financial planning, and strong cash generation, leave us in the position of strength as we work through the balance of the year. For all the positive dynamics we are experiencing in our business. It's clear that COVID-19 continues to act a severe toll on the economy, and more importantly, the people of our country. It goes beyond any business implications, but simply as human beings, one cannot look at the ongoing health impacts and loss of life and see it as anything but a tragic situation. With this as a backdrop, it is our heartfelt hope that everyone on this call, your families as well as our employees, trade partners and the communities we serve remain healthy and safe. From our health officials to our front-line workers, to pharmaceutical companies, the efforts to battle this virus has been heroic. Before we get into discussing our second quarter financial results, let me provide a brief update on the impacts of the pandemic and insights on how we are running the business currently. At the outset of the pandemic, we closed our sales centers and model homes and quickly pivoted to working remotely and selling virtually. I am pleased to say that we began reopening our sales centers and models in early May. And we are now fully open and staff to work with our walk-in and by appointment customers. As you would expect, our salespeople are using appropriate PPE, are adhering to social distancing practices and are following enhanced cleaning and disinfecting processes to help protect the health of our employees and customers. While our sales centers are open, we are interacting with customers on their preferred terms because not everyone is comfortable with in-person meetings. We continue to take full advantage of available technology and tools that have successfully supported our efforts to sell homes virtually. Except for a handful of markets, home building was deemed an essential service from the start of COVID-19. So disruptions to our construction operations were minor even during the early stages of the pandemic. At present, our operations are fully functional in all markets across the country. Again, in partnership with our trades, we are using appropriate PPE and are adhering to social distancing practices to protect workers on the job site and in the homes. And finally, our financial services group truly did an outstanding job, adjusting their business model to work remotely and handle every aspect of the mortgage and closing processes virtually. At present, personnel are still working off-site, but as demonstrated by the strong second quarter financial results and high capture rate, the team continues to perform at a very high level. Thanks to the tremendous effort of our purchasing team, working in conjunction with our suppliers. Our supply chain has held up well with minimal disruptions to our home building operations. Working closely with sales and construction, our purchasing group has been able to navigate around potential shortages and ensure ongoing availability of key building products. Given the rebound in housing, we have been increasing our land acquisition and development spend, this primarily relates to land deals where we negotiated purchase delays of anywhere from 30 to 90 days. We are now completing most of these transactions when the new closing date arrives. Unfortunately, it's clear that COVID-19 is not going away anytime soon. So we remain disciplined and thoughtful in our land investments. This includes increasing our use of options, which now account for 46% of the lots that we control. On the people side, I am very pleased to say that improved market dynamics have allowed us to bring back the majority of the employees that we furloughed during the quarter. We have also had the opportunity to rehire a small number of the people we released in May, which is a good feeling. I would note that most of the individuals returning to our organization are in the field construction roles. Obviously, the demand for new homes has experienced a dramatic rebound over the past eight to 10 weeks, following the initial shock from COVID-19. While housing demand certainly continues to benefit from historically low interest rates, analyzing the drivers of demand suggests there are likely additional factors that work as well. First, looking at the number of internet searches related to home buying, the data indicate that there has been an increase in consumer interest in homes. Particularly new homes, utilizing available Google trends data, we can view patterns for specific search terms commonly associated with buying a new home. Despite the overlay of COVID-19 searches for new home related terms has been growing since mid-March. In fact, we have routinely seen multi-year highs in the number of searches related to shopping for a new home. I would note that we have seen a similar pattern in terms of Google searches for Del Webb, which are up dramatically in May and June. In fact, unique visitors to our Del Webb site are now approaching 70,000 per week and are trending higher than they were at this time last year. Second, while we can debate the magnitude, ZIP code level analysis on buying patterns points to a movement of renters and homeowners from urban centers into the surrounding suburbs. Based on an internal survey, roughly half of our division presidents report that their business has experienced a modest increase in demand from urban buyers, while several of our divisions referenced a material increase in such demand. And finally, we see the third and possibly largest driver of demand for new homes being the very limited supply of existing housing stock available today. At the end of May, the total housing inventory was 1.55 million units, which was down 19% from the prior year. I'm sure we can all appreciate that it's hard to be comfortable opening your home to strangers during a global pandemic. The strong demand has also helped to absorb some of the spec inventory, which had built up in the system in March and April. Data show that in markets where we operate the number of quick-move-in homes available for sale fell by 16% from the end of March through the end of June, a lot has been made about the advantage of having spec units available. But the draw down in supply and a build cycle of less than 80 days for a first-time buyer product allows our build-to-order model to compete very effectively and with less risk. The combination of strong demand and limited inventory has also allowed us to raise prices across many of our communities. In fact, more than half of our divisions report raising prices in 50% or more of their communities. The typical price increase is in the range of 1% to 3% and includes changes in base price and/or reductions in incentives. The positive change in market dynamics from April to the end of June has been dramatic and gives us greater confidence about the business moving forward. As such, we are reestablishing guidance for the remainder of 2020, which Bob will provide as part of his review of our second quarter results. In this regard, I want to say that the volatility caused by the pandemic is unlike anything this industry has experienced, even during the worst of the Great Recession. The swings in demand during the second quarter alone were fast and severe, buyer demand is clearly experienced a dramatic recovery in the quarter and has remained strong through the first three weeks of July. That being said, COVID hotspots continue to grow in size and number, which in turn is slowing down the reopening of state and local economies. It is impossible to forecast how these dynamics will unfold in the coming weeks and months. For PulteGroup, we will be optimistic about future market conditions that remain very disciplined and measured in how we manage our business. Now, let me turn the call to Bob for a review of our second quarter results. Bob? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan and good morning. Similar to our first quarter call, I won't go through our typical detailed analysis of our income statement and balance sheet, but I'll talk about the business in the context of COVID-19. Also given the volatility in market conditions during the quarter, where needed, I will provide some insights on the change in our business as the quarter progressed. And finally, as Ryan stated, we will be providing guidance on our expected third quarter and full year 2020 results. For our second quarter, wholesale revenues increased 3% to $2.5 billion, the higher revenues in the period were driven by a 6% increase in closings to 5,937 homes, partially offset by a 3% decrease in average sales price to $416,000. Consistent with recent trends, the lower average sales price primarily reflects changes in the product and geographic mix of homes closed. I would highlight that these changes were exaggerated in the quarter as the pandemic caused temporary market shutdowns in several higher price locations, including Northern California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and the State of Washington. Closings for the quarter consisted of 31% first time, 44% move up and 25% active adult. This compares with prior year closings of 28% first time, 46% move up and 26% active adult. Net new orders for the second quarter, totaled 6,522 homes, which is down 4% from last year, given that we started the quarter with April orders down 53% from the prior year, this represents a tremendous turnaround in demand. For the entire quarter, first time orders were up 17% to 2,327 homes, move up orders were down 7% to 2,873 homes and active adult orders were down 22% to 1,322 homes. We've gotten questions over the quarter about how active adult buyers are behaving. So I want to note that demand among this group improved in each month to two quarter. In fact, June orders were up 21% over last year with active adult buyers more comfortable going out and with the amenities now reopened in our communities, the buying and selling process is feeling more routine. At the same time, active adult buyers are finding a strong demand environment that they have to sell an existing home, so we are optimistic that an ongoing recovery in this part of our business. For the quarter, our cancellation rate was 19% compared with 14% last year, the higher cancellation rate was driven by elevated cancellations in April, as the cancellation rate felt only 12% of our orders in June. As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call, we have seen that buyers are excited to close. We ended the second quarter with 13,214 homes in backlog, which is an increase of 12% over last year. At the end of the quarter, we had 10,946 homes under construction, which is down 4% from last year. But the homes currently in production, 2,121 or 19% were specs. In aggregate, the lower number of homes under construction is consistent with our decision to tightly manage starts as demand collapsed early in the pandemic, while we are focused on building sold homes, we have started to increase the number of speculative starts in an effort to get us closer to our target ratio of specs, representing approximately 25% to 30% of units in production. Based on our backlog and the number of units in production, we currently expect to deliver between 6,000 and 6,300 homes in the third quarter, further, we now expect deliveries for the full year to be in the range of 23,500 to 24,000 homes, with an average price and backlog of approximately $438,000, we expect third quarter ASP to be in the range of $425,000 to $435,000. For the full year, we expect average sales price on deliveries to be between $420,000 and $430,000. As always, the mix of deliveries will influence the average sales price we realized in any given quarter. Back to my review of our second quarter results, gross margin for the quarter was 23.9%, which represents an increase of 80 basis points over last year and a sequential gain of 20 basis points from the first quarter. Margins in the quarter benefited from the strong sales environment in the back half of 2019, when the majority of these homes were sold. Our margins also reflect lower incentives, as sales discounts were down 40 basis points from last year to 3.5% and down 10 basis points from the first quarter of this year. Given today's favorable demand conditions, we expect gross margins to remain strong through the back half of the year. Currently, we expect gross margin for the third quarter to be in the range of 23.9%, 24.2% with full year gross margin to be in the range of 23.8%, 24.1%. Our reported SG&A expense in the second quarter was $197 million or 8% of home sale revenues included in our reported SG&A was a $61 million pre-tax benefit, resulting from the reversal of an insurance reserve partially offset by the previously announced $10 million pre-tax charge or severance resulting from staffing actions taken in the quarter. Excluding these two items, our adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was $247 million or 10% of home sale revenues, which is 80 basis points better than in the second quarter of last year. The improvement in overhead leverage was driven by the volume growth realized in the quarter, along with the actions taken to lower overhead expenses in response to changing market conditions. While we typically give guidance only for full year SG&A expenditures, we are providing Q3 numbers as well. We currently expect SG&A expense to be in the range of 9.9% to 10.4% of revenues for the third quarter and our adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 10.3% to 10.7% of revenues for the full year. Turning to financial services, our operations generated $60 million of pre-tax income, representing an outstanding 141% increase over the prior year. The increase was driven by an improved margin environment, higher loan volumes resulting from growth in the company's home building operations and a higher capture rate. In fact, our mortgage capture rate for the second quarter increased to 87% from 81% last year. The improved capture rate reflects the opportunity our home building operations are finding to leverage Pulte Mortgage in providing value-added services to our customers. The investments our financial services team have made in building their technology platform allowed them to transition to offsite operations with virtual processing without missing a beat. Closing out my comments on our income statement, our second quarter income tax expense was $108 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 23.7%. This compares to tax expense of $80 million for an effective rate of 24.9% last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than last year and our historic guidance, primarily because of energy tax credits realized in the periods. Going forward, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete permanent differences like the energy tax credits that may arise. Our reported net income for the second quarter was $349 million or $1.29 per share, while our adjusted net income was $311 million or $1.15 per share. Prior year net income for the period was $241 million or $0.86 per share. Moving over to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash, after having repaid the $700 million we drew down from our revolving credit facility in March. In addition to our strong operating results, our second quarter cash position benefited from our actions to strategically defer investments in land and vertical construction costs, as well as our decision to suspend our share repurchase activities. Having repaid the revolver, we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 32.1%, while our net debt to capital ratio felt a 15.5%. In the second quarter, we invested $452 million in land acquisition and developments, which is down from $619 million in Q1 of this year and $857 million in the second quarter of last year. I would note that last year spend included $136 million related to the American West acquisition. Through the first six months of 2020, we have invested approximately $1.1 billion in land acquisition and related development. Given the improving market conditions, we are increasing our investment in both land development and the purchase of new land assets. As such, we expect our full year land investment will be approximately $2.7 billion, as we begin completing land deals that we previously deferred. I'd like to highlight that the pandemic and any material impact it has on housing demand or the consumer and the broader economy could influence how much capital we ultimately invest. We ended the quarter with 163,000 lots under control, of which 46% are options. This represents our highest option position in over a decade, as we continue to progress toward our target of 50% owned and 50% options. Let me now turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments, Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Operating in the midst of a global pandemic and extreme market volatility, the company delivered an outstanding quarterly earnings performance, while generating strong cash flows that further strengthened our financial position and flexibility. I want to say that we are certainly encouraged by the rebound and acceleration in demand that we've experienced over the past few months. While there are different thoughts on the drivers of this demand, what is clear is that the desire for home ownership remains high for all buyer groups, whether it's the first time buyer looking to exit a shared living space or the active adult buyer looking for a new adventure, people want a place to call their own. That being said, we continue to monitor the acceleration of COVID-19 cases in cities across the country, along with delays and even step backs in the reopening of local economies. Given these conditions, we remain committed to taking a disciplined and thoughtful approach to running our business. While we have had to adjust business practices, our fundamental goals and strategies have not changed, as we continue to focus on generating high returns through time. This means allocating capital and alignment with our stated priorities of investing in the business, paying our dividend and when appropriate returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases. This also means operating against the same risk weighted criteria that we have used so successfully to invest in land for the past eight years. Although, given today's environment, we are certainly working to assess any elevated risks associated with operating during a global pandemic. I want to thank all of our teams from our corporate and division offices to our frontline field personnel for their tremendous efforts during these very challenging times, everyone has pulled together as we transitioned our operations to work remotely and then where appropriate moved back on site as sales centers could reopen and markets exited their lockdowns. From implementing new technologies and virtual selling strategies, we\u2019re using PPE and appropriate social distancing, our people have done smart, fast, resilient and maybe most of all invested in each other and in our company. Let me turn the call back to Jim. Jim Ossowski : Great. Thanks Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can ask \u2013 so we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of the call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thanks, and Sharon would ask, could you just repeat the instructions and we'll get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Lovallo : Thank you for taking my question. The first one is, obviously the bounce that we've seen has been remarkable in terms of strength and sustainability here. But I guess the question is, going forward, the big question in our mind is, how sustainable is this going to be? And I know that's a very difficult thing to answer, but what I'm wondering is, what are the things that you're kind of monitoring to gauge whether you should kind of step on the gas here or maybe pull back a bit? Ryan Marshall : Well, John it's Ryan and good morning, thanks for the question. We're monitoring all the same metrics that we typically monitor when we run the business. So we're looking at what's going on with consumer behavior, what are we seeing the desire for home ownership, what's happening in a new home searches on the internet, some of the things that we described in our prepared remarks. We clearly pay attention to what's happening in the resale market, which still to this day remains our biggest competitor. Certainly we have new home competitors, but with the majority of home sales being dominated by resale, we certainly pay attention to what's happening there. We look at what's happening in the job market with unemployment, with job creation, et cetera. So we're really focused, John, the biggest thing that I would emphasize is we're focused on delivering high returns through time. And so while we certainly have got a little bit of a tailwind at our back right now with consumer demand, the investments that we're making, the way that we're running the company, the way that we're managing debt, the way that we're managing cash, we're very much focused on those being through cycle type you movements. The other thing, I think in the more kind of short-term that we've got to pay attention to is state, shelter in place orders, and what might potentially happen as local economies may revert back to Phase 1, Phase 2, et cetera, certainly that could have an impact on the kind of shorter-term demand that we might see in a sales office. John Lovallo : That's helpful. And then maybe just on the Vegas market specifically in American West. So what \u2013 are you seeing any improvement there as some of the casinos have begun to reopen? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Surprisingly John, if you remember, at the end of the first quarter call, I highlighted Vegas as a market that we were quite concerned about given the dominance of tourism and travel related economy. That market has performed incredibly well, and in fact had a spectacular June. So with the reopening of the casinos, even at a limited capacity, we've seen a lot of the local workers go back to work. And folks are back in the casinos and staying at the hotels. So our Vegas business did quite well in June, and we're very happy about that. John Lovallo : Great. Thanks very much guys. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, John. Operator : Next question comes from Mike Dahl. Please state your company. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Chris on from Mike. Thanks for taking our questions. My first question, which I want to ask, what's your latest price versus a thoughts are in the current demand environment. You guys mentioned you were able to raise pricing over 50% of your communities, which is kind of in line with what we were seeing as well. And I was hoping to see, if your thinking has changed at all in terms of pricing. When should we think about price moving up past that 1% to 3%, you mentioned, given work demands running right now? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Chris. It's the same process that we've always used, which is we evaluated on a community-by-community basis, taking into consideration what's happening in the local resale market that we compete against as well as what we're doing in our competitive efforts against our other new home competitors. Those are the things that really influence, what's going on in our pricing decisions. We're certainly focused on driving the best through cycle returns that we can. And so, that continues to be the overarching theme and umbrella that we use to make decisions. I would remind you that, you need to really pay attention to rent as well, especially with our first time buyer business that is an alternative source of shelter for that consumer. And so they're going to constantly look at the economics of what's more advantageous. So while demand is good, we don't believe that you can raise prices in an unfettered work. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That makes sense. And then just my second question, I probably could drill in a little deeper into the latest demand trends you're seeing in some of the COVID hotspots in Texas, Florida, Arizona. I really, it's tough to gauge what demand ultimately look like there, but for the last few weeks, have you seen any sort of decipherable trends as far as the impact there? Ryan Marshall : Yes. So those markets have been incredibly strong for us, Chris. The three that you highlighted Arizona, particularly Phoenix, Texas and Florida, not only are they hot in temperature right now, they're also hot in terms of sales pace. So despite the fact that there has been an increase in COVID cases in those markets, they have been some of the most aggressive in reopening the local economies. And we've certainly seen that translate in success in our sales offices as well. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Appreciate the color guys. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Michael Rehaut : Hi, thanks, good morning, everyone, and congrats on the recent results. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Mike. Michael Rehaut : Where that hit, and I know it's a little tough to go too detailed. But the June result is obviously, incredibly strong and you talked about July showing strength as well. But I think there is obviously a lot of focus around the exit rate coming out of the quarter. I assume you don't want people to model 50% order growth in the back half of the year. So it's just trying to get a sense of, maybe to give a rough idea of so far, how July is trending, obviously there is a lot of movement within the quarter, there could be some pent up demand, it can also be some increased incremental demand from meets and perhaps COVID itself. But any directional help around how July is going so far and around any expectations of, where that order growth may or may not settle out in the third quarter would be helpful. I know it's very forward looking, but the numbers are just very, very volatile currently. Ryan Marshall : Yes Mike, good morning and thanks for the question. June was a spectacular month and we're very pleased with that. To your point, I do think there was some pent up demand for a lot of the reasons that we listed in our prepared remarks and some of the things that you've highlighted. So to assume that growth rates like that would continue forward, that's \u2013 the time will tell. What I will tell you about July and we're not going to deviate from our traditional practice other than to comment on the how the first three or so weeks of July have been. The first three weeks in July had continued to be strong, albeit on a somewhat seasonally adjusted basis as we go into the kind of dog days of summer. So we're very happy with how July has performed, we're optimistic about kind of what the summer selling months will hold for our business. But we\u2019ll stop short of kind of providing a full forecast for the third quarter. Michael Rehaut : Okay. I appreciate that. And obviously had to try there, because again, there is a tremendous amount of focus. Second question, I guess, talking about the price increases and about half your communities, which is encouraging. Obviously, you've had a spike in lumber costs as well. Traditionally, actually when you've had cost inflation, you've actually had the industry has to believe and had margin expansion is top line gains exceed, the cost side of the business. Do you see the current environment as being anything different and could you mention obviously trying to not allow pricing to get out of hand you don't want to price yourself out maybe similar to a couple of years ago? But how do you see your ability to at least offset cost inflation in the current environment? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. Hey Mike, it's Bob and a fair question. Certainly lumber has trended to candidly all time highs. We've given a guide on our margins for the balance of the year. And I think most folks are familiar with the way we purchased lumber, it's on a trailing 13 week basis. And so our lumber package pricing for the balance of the year is pretty much set. So these increases will really be more of an impact in 2021, depending on how the market, the lumber market performs over the next three to six weeks, 12 weeks. So on balance, actually the market is pretty good for commodities, lumber being an outlier. And I think most builders were able to try and work with their trades to drive pricing down, we'll see some benefit for that, that's incorporated into our guide for the balance of the year twice you see margin improving as we continue through the year. Given the pretty quick ramp up in the business, I think it's reasonable to expect that the trades will be looking for some of that money back as time goes by. In a world where we can get some modest price increases that's to your point, usually sufficient for us to offset it those potential increases in costs. So we're not giving a guide on margin beyond 2020, but you can tell from the guide for the balance of the year, which is up from where we were in Q3, which is \u2013 sorry, Q2, which was up from Q1 and up a lot from last year that the market is pretty good. And so we are always conscious of overall affordability to Ryan's point, rent is always the biggest competitor and\\or resale, but we feel pretty good about our pricing opportunities and our cost controls today. Operator : Next question comes from Kenneth Zener with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Kenneth Zener : Good morning, everybody. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Ken. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hi, Ken. Kenneth Zener : Can you \u2013 given your \u2013 appreciate the outlet and the volatility. Given your closing guidance for 3Q, it's actually a little higher as a percent of your units under construction than is normal, which reflects slower initial construction phase in the second quarter. But can you talk to how you think the industry or Pulte in particular might be constrained in terms of production? There is obviously a lot of order growth, demand in a time of job losses. But, what is really constraining your growth? I mean, is it that your build construction times, you don't want to go out more than six months? You made very specific comments around a pre-build model, it's not what you want to do, but you said you guys can do first time buyers, I believe in 80 days. So what is really the protection constraints you're seeing within given communities that kind of limits your units under construction as we think about where you can go in the second half of the year? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Good morning, Ken and thanks for the question. When we think about production constraints, it's \u2013 the number one continues to be labor, which is not a new theme, the entire industry has talked about that for a long time. And it's one of the big reasons that we made the acquisition of ICG down in Jacksonville earlier in the years, we felt that moving to more offsite type manufacturing was going to be one of the ways that we could really look to eliminate some of the pinch points over time over the long pole with labor, by being more efficient with the way that we're able to manufacture the shell. So labor, I think continues to be the number one theme. What we are finding is that the labor wants to work. So as shelter in place, restrictions have been lifted more and more and using appropriate PPE and social distancing, we've been able to get homes built. There are additional requirements, I would tell you that it probably adds a few days in some places to cycle time, just because it's a little bit slower than what you'd maybe ideally like. So that might be a little bit of an added overlay constraint directly related to COVID. The other one is municipality. So, municipalities are typically fairly lean in inspectors and permit, their back office permitting facilitation. And so as those municipalities have sheltered in place, and they've asked their city and county employees to do the same, we have seen and experienced a bit of delay in our overall cycle time, just in our ability to get permits and get instructions. Kenneth Zener : Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Truman Patterson : Hi, good morning guys. Nice results, and thank you for all the detail. There is a lot to digest there. So first question, big picture you're seeing some buyers exit, more densely populated urban areas, which metros or regions are you seeing as the most pronounced? And on top of that, are you actually seeing migration from a more densely populated regions, like the Northeast to less densely populated areas like the South? And just looking forward, how do you think this kind of plays out over the next year or two? Ryan Marshall : Good morning, Truman; it\u2019s Ryan. Thanks for the question. As far \u2013 I'll answer your second question first, as far as Northeast to the South, that's a trend that we've been experiencing for a long time. And so it's hard to suggest that it's any more than what it already was due to solve or housing affordability and a number of other things as some of the Southern States, I think have really worked to ramp up their job creation and create opportunities in the South. So I would suggest that, that continues to kind of happen and I wouldn't necessarily suggest that it's accelerating. As far as, the markets that we highlighted, where we are seeing an increase in our local business as a result of an urban exodus, if you will, I'll use that term loosely San Antonio, North Florida, Southwest Florida, which for us would be the Naples Fort Myers, Sarasota kind of West coast of Florida. And then we're also seeing a bit of it in the Northeast corridor, which is middle and Southern Jersey and in the Pennsylvania. So there, I think we are seeing some folks that maybe were living closer to the city, New York City that is looking for an opportunity to be a little bit more suburban in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thanks for that. And then on your entry level, just some of your thoughts moving forward, you all have a \u2013 it seems like now you're making a bit more of an aggressive push towards the first time buyer entry-level segment. What portion of your business are you kind of targeting at this point? Is it primarily through expanding through your Centex brand nationwide? And it seems like everybody that makes us rotation it's really been actually a benefit to gross margin. Can you just talk about some of those moving parts for us? Ryan Marshall : Sure, I'll take you on a bit of a time machine trip and go back to fall of 2016. We talked to the company that we felt that we had an opportunity to reposition our business to be a bit more balanced in the consumers that we target. And we laid out that ideally we wanted our first time buyer business to be about 35% of our business. What we highlighted was, is that we wanted to do it the right way and intentionally go out and buy parcels of the land that would allow us to be \u2013 to effectively and successfully and specifically target the first time buyer business. We've done that as is evidenced by the lots that we control currently for our first time buyer business equal 34% of the total lots we control are targeted to the first time by our business. And what we talked about is it would take some time from the time that we acquire and secure that land to where you see it coming through in the business. The most recent quarter, 31% of our closings represent \u2013 or were specifically targeted to the first time buyer, that compares to 32% of our closings in Q2 \u2013 I mean Q1. So we're \u2013 and then, compared to prior year\u2019s second quarter, we were 28%. So what you've seen is it's gone from our business being 26%, 27% first time to we're now in the 31%, 32%. And we're moving much closer to that ideal target of 35%. So we think it's done wonders for our business, we're seeing nice growth there, we're probably just a few percentage points shy of where we ideally want to be in terms of closing mix at this point in time, but we've got the land pipeline that will drive that. Operator : Next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner : Hey guys, good morning. Nice quarter and congrats on the execution during this difficult time. Ryan, just on that last point on the land pipeline, obviously you're starting to gradually ramp the acquisition and development back up again and presumably the land you're buying now is probably for maybe late 2021, 2022 deliveries, I would imagine at this point. But just trying to think forward here, you're in a difficult spot where you kind of do have to take a view on the sustainability of the trends we're seeing now, you could do certain things to mitigate the risks such as optioning more. But, when you look at 2021 and the pipeline you have, assuming this is sustainable. Do you foresee any air pockets on the supply side, thinking about the land pipeline primarily, where you would not be in a position to grow in 2021, assuming this kind of flurry of activity continues through the end of the year or do you think the pipeline is sufficient to continue growing through 2021? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. We're not giving any guidance on 2021 at this point in time. What I will tell you just broadly about our land pipeline is it's healthy. We control over 160,000 lots. And to your point about how sustainable and how you can manage that risk with that forward view, it's a bigger reason that we've been driving toward the 50/50 mix on owned versus option. I'm really proud of what our team has been able to do and pushing that number to 46% options, which is the highest that we've ever seen in our business in over a decade. So that's a real win. And when we look at the lots that we've actually approved in the current year, the percentage of options are over 60%. So while we've moved the entire portfolio inclusive of Del Webb, when we isolate it just to 2020 acquisitions, we're north of 60%. So I think that's a big part of it. We've got a really big backlog, Alan, we're over 13,000 homes in backlog, 12% increase over prior year. So we're well positioned to not only deliver the next six months of the year, but that gives us a really nice kind of running start into early 2021 as well, which we think is a real advantage in kind of our build-to-order model is that it gives us so much forward visibility. And we know that it's a big part of what's continues to contribute to the outsize margins that our business is able to generate. We did highlight in Q1 and again, as part of kind of our land spend numbers in this quarter, we did we were cautious in the amount of land development dollars that we outlaid early in Q2. Certainly that will have a bit of impact on our ability to get new communities opened on the original timeline. We think that's a short-term kind of blip and it's not something that's going to materially impact our ability to continue to perform well. Alan Ratner : Got it. That's helpful, Ryan. I appreciate that. And then second, you had some positive comments on Vegas earlier, and it's good to see that market continuing to or performing well in the face of a tough job environment there. As you look at the land spend for the back half of the year and your footprint, you have the benefit of being very well diversified. Are there any markets, thinking about Vegas or Orlando, maybe where you're going to be a little bit more conservative on land spend and perhaps reallocate those dollars elsewhere or do you feel like your whole portfolio right now has an equal look at land opportunities? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Alan, it's Bob. I think the simple answer to that is that all the markets are open. We are seeing positive demand trends across the country as Ryan walks you through. And so our view is until we see something change, we're willing and able to invest everywhere. You heard Ryan say that we're looking through with a little bit tighter lens. And, so as an example, for the things that we deferred 30 or 60 or 90 days ago, we have a new process that we've instituted where Jim Ossowski and the asset management team actually refreshes our expectations of market conditions. So at approval that got me for argument's sake, 10 months ago, waiting for some final entitlement. Before we move money, we're actually going back and saying, okay, did the pro formas that we built then do they still apply. And so I think, what I would characterize it is we're using the same discipline we always have. We've put one more hurdle in the purchase process. And that hurdle is applicable to every market. And so using Vegas or North Florida, in your example certainly, as Vegas has opened and improved our attitude towards it has gotten a little bit better. And so really we're looking at current on the ground data. We're listening to what the state regulators, governments are saying about shelter-in-place. And we think we're making educated investment decisions. So I don\u2019t know if that gets you all the way to where you want it to be, but in general, we're open for business, but we are being disciplined in that thought process. Operator : Next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Yes. Thanks very much, guys. I'm really intrigued about the opportunity for you guys to raise prices. I know you said, you raised prices in more than half of your communities in one and a half year divisions. And I'm thinking that you've probably crossed over the absorption rate threshold in your communities and most of your communities by now, above which further growth lead you to raise price. We're also seeing mortgage rates down 80 basis points year-over-year. And so I'm thinking that the median monthly payment that your entry level buyer is paying is probably down quite a bit and probably down a lot more than the decline and they're seeing in rents. So I'm curious, when was the last time you think you saw buyer's monthly payments down this much versus rents. And is there any reason to think that there is going to, that's going to be provide you a lot of headroom to raise prices, in a way that is very different from what we've seen in the last few years? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, a tough question. There's a lot in that, I'll try and unpack it. And maybe easier than unpacking it is just to simply say, it's a really favorable demand environment out there. And I think as we highlighted, there's a number of factors that are driving that. One, money is very affordable right now. And so the prospect of being able to afford a new home is probably better than it's been a long time. I will caveat it by saying the first-time buyers still got to have a down payment. So there's got to be enough savings from somewhere in order to make that happen. And we don't see that being a huge impediment, but it is a restrictor out there that our hurdle rate or hurdle that needs to be cleared before the first-time buyer can enter the home buying market or the home ownership market. To your point, Stephen, I think it's not been often that the decline in interest rates and resulting payment has been faster than the decline in rent. And so you combine that with the fact that there's a desire to probably not live in more densely constructed apartment type complexes. I think those are really positive tailwinds for the entire industry. And certainly, as we move our business closer to 35%, being first time, we think that bodes well for the future of the business. Stephen Kim : Yes, it certainly does. My follow-up relates to the down payment comment that you made. Historically, you're right, down payment has been viewed as like one of the key impediments to first-time buyers. But I'm thinking in this environment, we've seen student loan forbearance through from March to September. We found that the average payment on that student debt is nearly $400 a month. If you take a couple with \u2013 that both may have student loans, I mean, ramp it out or grow it through September plus a couple of $1,200 stimulus checks. I mean, that alone can pretty much match go a long way towards providing the down payment. So I'm curious as to whether or not you are hearing from the folks in your communities, the sales folks that the ability to come up with a down payment is not the hurdle that it once was. And in fact, that hurdle may actually be getting lower given the increased savings. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, I don't know that we've specifically heard direct feedback on down payment related concerns that there's anything there that I would highlight. What I would tell you is evidenced by the year-over-year growth rate that we highlighted in our June sales from the first-time segment. We were up 70%, 70-plus percent in the first-time buyer segment. So if you use that as a data point, it wouldn't largely suggest that those buyers are able and are finding ways to come up with a down payment, whether it's from the means that you suggested or something else, the money is clearly there and that's translating into a favorable sales environment out of that segment. Operator : Next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Susan. Susan Maklari : My first question is, can you give us a little bit more color on the SG&A side, especially as it sounds like you have taken back some of those people that you've furloughed and perhaps we're even adding to the headcount from some of the more permanent reductions that you did. How should we think about that flowing through? And can you give us some sense of where you are in terms of the headcount? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. Sure, Susan. I think if you kind of piece together everything that we included in the remarks, because the business has been strong, we have brought back almost all of the furloughed folks that we had asked to wait to come back to work. We've even rehired a couple of people but on balance, we had announced about $65 million worth of save in fiscal 2020 related to the actions that we took. And I would tell you that remains pretty much where we think we landed. We may reintroduce a couple of costs and principally I'm thinking on the IT side, to make sure we continue to advance that work beyond where we thought we would, based on the work we did in May. So with that, our spend is pretty much what we thought it was going to be that is reflected in the guide that we gave. So if you think about it, our full year guide at 10.3% to 10.7% of revenues in SG&A is better than by about 20 basis points, the guide that we had at the beginning of the year which we obviously took down at the beginning of the pandemic. So we don't see a lot of creep back into the business, which is good. And we want to be disciplined about that. We hadn't included the furloughed folks in the save. And so we had hoped and expected to bring those folks back to work. They've come back, to Ryan's point, they're mostly field personnel, so they're serving revenue producing activities. So we feel pretty good about our expense structure for where we are in the business. And if the business continues to perform at a heightened level, we might need to bring some more people back. But again, I think that would be well leveraged from an overhead perspective, because they would be bringing \u2013 we would be bringing them back to do things once again that are revenue producing. Susan Maklari : Okay. All right. That's very helpful. And then, given the trends that we've seen and obviously, the relative confidence in your outlook, can you just talk a bit to what you need to see to get comfortable, to start to resume some of the repurchase activity and any color on what the timing of that could potentially be? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. So I think in fairness, we've come through a pretty tough time. We fully drew our revolver. We were able to pay that back comfortably. We have a very nice cash position, debt-to-cap is at 32% and a year ago it was at 35%. So we've made progress there. If you look at it on a net basis, it's a 15.5% down from 29% a year ago. So feel really good about our financial position. Having said that, we're still in the midst of a pandemic and so I think what we will do is very consistent with what we've done historically is we'll report the news. So as and when we get into the market after we've done that, you'll hear about it. But the process will be, Ryan and I, and the team here will work through, what are our medium to longer term capital needs? What do we think the business produces no different than pre-pandemic, share and work through that with the board and come up with a game plan for how to repurchase equity. You heard Ryan say it earlier in the call, our capital priorities have not changed. It's still invested in the business at high return, it's pay our dividend and if we have extra, we will use it to buy back stock. We also talked about leverage. We're in a good spot there. We do have a maturity in March of next year, $420-some-odd million. That will be something that we would likely at this point think that we're going to use cash to satisfy. But obviously market conditions needs for cash and capital will weigh on that as we get closer. So we'll have more to say about that as time goes by. Operator : Next question comes from Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Jay McCanless : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, the first question I had is could you give us any color on where you expect community growth for the rest of this year and maybe a hint or a preview for 2021? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, so community count growth we are thinking is going to be somewhere from between 2% and 4% down in Q3 and Q4 each versus the average in the preceding year quarter. So Q3 versus Q3 of the year prior, certainly the development delays and the land purchase delays. You heard Ryan talk about it earlier in the call, that come from what we did, call it beginning of April through the middle to late June. We've started to ramp that back up but that will have an impact on our community count as we go forward. We have not provided any guidance for fiscal 2021. We'll give you that as we get closer to the end of the year and we go through our planning process. Jay McCanless : That's helpful. Thank you for that. The second question I had in terms of what you're looking for, for new land acquisition and some of the migration away from the urban core, you guys talked about. I mean, is Pulte as a company starting to look at further out land positions, larger land positions, more lots, I mean, has COVID and everything we've seen over the last four months affected the way you guys are buying land or thinking about land going forward? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Jay, this is Ryan. I think what we highlighted is that the process that we've used to evaluate risk associated with buying land remains very consistent. So we have not made major changes there. Certainly, I do think the changes in consumer behavior from COVID that will clearly influence things over time. I think some of the bigger influences are going to be on home design, quite frankly. But our business always has been somewhat or mostly suburban, just because that's where available land is. So as far as going into the exurbs and into B and C type locations and really making big bets on land, I don't know that you should expect to see that from us. We're going to continue to be very disciplined in where we invest. We still think that access to transportation corridors, good schools, employment, entertainment, shopping, et cetera. We still think those things all matter. And so we're going to continue to look at buying in locations where we think buyers want to be, pre-COVID, post-COVID. And those are the elements that we think drive through-cycle return. Jay McCanless : Do you think that and from a plan standpoint, you guys are in good shape or are you seeing a lot more requests for the double work from home or the students and the kids working from home environment, are you guys adapting to that? And what are you hearing from your customers right now, as far as that goes, if you're not going to go further out, maybe talk about what you're going to do with some of the house plans, et cetera? Ryan Marshall : Yes. So Jay, I think it's one of the things that's been a real strength for the company is our consumer inspired focus and the research that we've been doing for the past seven or eight years with our commonly managed plans. We've really been designing and creating just some spectacular floor plans that not only I think meet current consumer needs, they allow for great flexibility. So in our build-to-order model, there are a number of things where we have flexible spaces that can be turned into a gym or a home office or a second master or an in-law suite. Those are all things that our current portfolio of plans allow for. We'll continue to listen to the customer, especially in light of what's currently changing to see if there's more opportunity to accelerate that. But keep in mind, what I highlighted early in the call, our biggest competitor is resale. And I can promise you that any of the new plans that we have are far better than housing stock that's 10, 20, 30 years old. Operator : At this time, I'll turn the call over to the presenters. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate everybody's time this morning. We'll be available for questions over the remainder of the day, and we'll look forward to speaking with you on the next call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference call over to Jim Zeumer. Sir, please go ahead. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Jamie, and good morning. Pleased to welcome you to PulteGroup\u2019s third quarter earnings call. We appreciate your time and hope that you are doing well. I\u2019m joined on today\u2019s call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior VP of Finance. Copy of this morning\u2019s earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today\u2019s call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of this call later today. I want to highlight that we will be discussing our reported results as well as our results adjusted to exclude the impact of certain tax credits reported in the period. Reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported results is included in this morning\u2019s release and within today\u2019s webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our results. Also, I want to alert everyone that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by comments made today. Most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Over the past six months, it has grown increasingly clear that new home construction is an economic bright spot, an important contributor to sustaining some level of forward movement in the broader economy. We certainly do not take this for granted and appreciate the daily lives of millions of people continue to be disrupted. As such, we sincerely hope that you and your families remain healthy and are successfully navigating these difficult times. We appreciate your time this morning and look forward to discussing PulteGroup\u2019s outstanding third quarter results. As you read in this morning\u2019s press release, gains can be seen throughout our third quarter operating and financial results, including a 7% growth in home sale revenues, a 140 basis point increase in reported gross margin to 24.5%, a 70 basis point improvement in the overhead leverage and a 33% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Whether looking at national data or PulteGroup\u2019s specific numbers, housing demand remained strong throughout the third quarter. Reviewing our numbers for the period, year-over-year unit orders increased 36% and showed strength across all price points, buyer groups and geographies. Along with the ongoing strength in our first-time buyer group, we saw notable pickup among our move up and in particular active adult businesses. Given the potentially higher risks associated with COVID-19, active adult buyers had been a softer part of the market at the onset of the pandemic. In this most recent quarter, however, net new orders from our active adult communities exceeded over 2,000 signups for the quarter. This is the highest level for any quarter in over a decade. You\u2019ve likely heard me say before, that a robust housing market requires a strong \u2013 require strong demand across all the consumer groups. I believe this is what we are experiencing now, a strength among entry level and first time buyers is enabling demand at the higher price points. Further given limited housing supply and the ongoing price appreciation, existing homeowners can more easily sell their existing home and move to the next property. Given the positive supply and demand environment, we have taken the opportunity to raise prices across most of our communities. In fact, more than half of our divisions increased prices across their entire portfolio with the typical increase realized in the quarter, being in the range of 1% to 3%. Based on recent conversations, it\u2019s clear that market pricing dynamics are an important topic of discussion for investors and analysts these days. PulteGroup is typically a price leader, but we are always looking for the right balance of price and pace. Affordability is still important as well. So it is important that we not become overly aggressive and move prices too fast or too high, particularly within first-time communities, given market competition and normal affordability constraints among entry level buyers, pushing prices a few thousand dollars too high can stall sales very quickly. The outstanding demand environment has in turn created a production environment that I believe favors the big builders. Right now, builders who have an existing land pipeline, the ability to develop incremental lots and can maintain access to trade resources have a competitive advantage in the market. I will tell you that our scale was instrumental and the company exceeding its closing guidance for the quarter and as Bob will discuss in enabling us to raise our closing guide for the full year. PulteGroup runs a highly efficient construction operation. The market dynamics are such that we must be focused and disciplined and how we are approaching the business in the current operating environment. On the land side, we have geared up land acquisition and development activities after suspending much of this work earlier in the year when COVID-19 first hit. For example, our land acquisition spend of $463 million in Q3 was double that of this year\u2019s second quarter and almost 70% higher than the same period last year. While much of our land investment in the quarter was the completion of transactions we delayed at the outset of the pandemic, we are identifying opportunities to selectively increase land spend where appropriate. In addition to increasing our land spend, I would highlight that we continue to make our pipeline more efficient was 47% of our lots are now controlled via option. It is important to note that it takes longer to ramp up land production than it does to slow it down, especially in today\u2019s environment, but we have a solid land pipeline that will allow us to continue to run our business efficiently. Consistent with our return focus, we are intelligently manning our existing lot inventory to support ongoing sales and minimize gap outs, while driving high returns on invested capital. On the house side, our construction and procurement teams are doing a great job, keeping the production machine running, as demonstrated by our improved closing volumes. At the risk of sounding repetitive, this day-to-day work is also not without its challenges. I would highlight that labor is tight across all markets and can be adversely impacted by pandemic related absences. So we are working closely with our trades to help ensure resources are available in the near-term and as we work to grow volumes in the future. That said, the building materials environment is even more dynamic these days. For example, our Q4 deliveries will feel the initial impact from this year\u2019s spike in lumber cost, and while wood prices appear to have rolled over, we will be dealing with the effects of higher lumber costs for several quarters. Beyond wood, we have had to manage through sporadic disruptions on everything from appliances and cabinets to plumbing fixtures and windows. I can\u2019t complement our procurement teams enough for their efforts to minimize construction delays. In addition to having an outstanding organization to help us manage through today\u2019s market conditions, we are working from a position of operational and financial strength. We ended the quarter with a backlog of almost 15,000 homes and a cash balance of $2.1 billion. Given these numbers, we are clearly well-positioned to deliver strong fourth quarter results, while having the financial strength and flexibility to pursue our strategic business objectives as we head into 2021. In conclusion, we are extremely pleased with our third quarter results and how our business is positioned heading into Q4 and the year ahead. While we grow increasingly confident in the sustainability of housing demand, we are well aware that we are operating within a global pandemic that is not really under control. As such, we continue to adhere to the business strategies and disciplines, which have guided our business for the past decade. We remain focused on achieving high returns over the housing cycle, while intelligently growing our business and allocating capital consistent with our stated priorities of investing in the business, paying our dividend and returning capital through share repurchase. To that last point, we have reinstated our share repurchase program beginning in the fourth quarter. As is our practice, we will provide an update on our purchase activities when we report our fourth quarter earnings. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a more detailed review of the quarter. Bob? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. In any market environment, our third quarter results were impressive, but given the backdrop and challenges of a global pandemic, I think the results were exceptional. As has been our practice this year, I\u2019ll be providing a high level review of the quarter, along with color on any impact COVID-19 had on our operations and on our outlook for the business. Looking at the business, our home sale revenues in the third quarter were up 7% over last year to $2.8 billion. The higher revenues for the period reflect the 4% increase in closing to 6,454 homes, in combination with a 3% increase in average sales price to $438,000. I would highlight the closings for the quarter came in slightly higher than our prior guidance, as we were able to sell and close more spec units than we anticipated in the period. Our higher average sales price in the third quarter was driven by higher prices within our move-up and active adult communities. First-time pricing was down slightly from last year, but this was driven by mix rather than an erosion in sales price. Demographic mix of third quarter closings was 30% first-time, 45% move-up and 25% active-adult. These numbers compare to last year\u2019s mix, which included 28% first-time, 46% move-up and 26% active adult. In the third quarter, our net new orders increased 36% over last year to 8,202 homes. Our average community count for the period was 892, which is an increase of 3% over last year. Average community count for the quarter was higher than our prior guidance since we were successful in accelerating community openings that had been anticipated to incur in the fourth quarter. Looking at sales activity during the quarter, demand and our volumes were relatively consistent across all three months. However, our September orders were modestly impacted by the fact the majority of our divisions took some level of action to manage sign of pace. Those actions were taken to properly manage our projected production environment with a view toward meeting customer expectations and reducing the risk of input cost inflation. In addition to the absolute increase in orders, we are extremely pleased by the strength and demand across each of the buyer groups. For the quarter first-time orders increased 39% to 2,443 homes. Move-up orders increased 39% to 3,697 homes and active adult orders were up 28% to 2062 homes. As Ryan mentioned, our active adult orders were the highest we\u2019ve reported for any quarter in the past decade. Our third quarter cancellation rate was up 12%, it was down from last year\u2019s 15% and our second quarter rate of 19%, and much more consistent with recent historic trend. As with our orders, the cancellation rate was stable over the quarter. Given the outstanding order activity in the period, we ended the third quarter with 14,962 homes in backlog. This is up 29% over last year. Our backlog value is up and even more significant at 32% to $6.6 billion, is our highest ending backlog value in more than 10 years. We ended the quarter with a total of 11,451 homes under construction. Of the homes currently under construction, 1,755 or 15% were specs. Our spec inventory is down from last year and down sequentially from the second quarter, due in large part to the pause in spec starts we put in place at the outset of the pandemic, coupled with the robust level of demand we\u2019ve experienced in the last several months. It is certainly our intent to increase spec starts and rebuild our inventory over time and our near term focus remains on delivering our backlog of sold homes. Based on the 11,451 homes under construction at the end of the quarter, we expect to deliver between 6,600 and 6,900 homes in the fourth quarter. As a result of the improved outlook for fourth quarter deliveries, coupled with the strength of our third quarter deliveries, our guidance for full year deliveries has also increased to a range of 24,350 to 24,650 homes. Given the average $441,000 selling price of homes in backlog, we expect the average sales price on fourth quarter closings to be in the range of $440,000 to $450,000. As always, the final mix in deliveries can influence the average sales price we ultimately realized in the quarter. Moving down the income statement, we are extremely pleased to report that our third quarter gross margin was 24.5%. This is an increase of 110 basis points over last year\u2019s adjusted gross margin and the sequential gain of 60 basis points from the second quarter of this year. Our margins continue to benefit from the strong demand environment, which has allowed us to raise prices and/or lower incentives in many of our markets. In the quarter, sales discount decreased 70 basis points from last year to 3.1% and fell 40 basis points from the second quarter of this year. As Ryan mentioned our future closings will begin feeling the impact of materially higher lumber costs, but we believe we\u2019re in a position to maintain gross margins at current levels over the balance of the year and expect gross margin in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the 24.5% realized in Q3. On a dollar basis, SG&A expense in the third quarter was $271 million, which was comparable to last year. Given the increase in 2020 closings and revenues, we were able to improve SG&A expense as a percentage of home sale revenues by 70 basis points to 9.6%. Given our third quarter results, we now expect full year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.3%, which indicates overhead leverage in the fourth quarter is expected to be consistent with our Q3 results on a percentage basis. Gains and overhead leverage in the quarter and for the year are being driven in part by the actions we took earlier in 2020 to lower expenses in response to COVID-19. Based on the rebound in sales activity compared to our expectations at the time we took those actions, we have reinstated nearly all of the employees we furloughed. We have also begun to selectively rehire personnel to maintain proper staffing levels within our sales, construction and financial services operations. While we had always assumed furloughed employees when we retained, the cost associated with new or rehired personnel have also been included in our SG&A guidance for 2020. Moving over to Financial Services. Third quarter pre-tax income effectively doubled over the prior year to $64 million. As has been the case for the prior two quarters, the increase in profitability reflects a favorable margin environment, higher loan volumes resulting from growth in our homebuilding operations and higher capture rates. Our mortgage capture rate for the third quarter was 86% compared with 84% last year. Looking at our taxes, income tax expense for the third quarter was $68 million. This represents an effective tax rate of 14%, which is down from an effective tax rate of 25.4% last year. Our rate for the quarter was lower than last year, because of energy tax credits recognized in the current period. Going forward, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete permanent differences, like the energy tax credits that may arise. Completing my comments on the income statement, our reported net income for the third quarter was $416 million or $1.54 per share. Excluding the income tax benefit related to the energy credit, our adjusted net income was $363 million or $1.34 per share. Our prior-year net income for the third quarter was $273 million or $0.99 per share with an adjusted net income of $280 million or $1.01 per share. Switching to the balance sheet. Our strong financial performance and resulting cash flows, allowed us to end the quarter with $2.1 billion of cash and a net debt to capital ratio of 9.6%. On a gross basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 30.8% down from 33.6% at the end of 2019. As previously discussed, we slowed our business investment activities in the second quarter as we assess the impact of COVID-19, and become more comfortable with the long-term trends for housing demand, we increased our land acquisition and development spend in the third quarter to $843 million. Some of this investment represents spend that had been delayed, but we remain confident that we\u2019ll achieve our plans to invest $2.7 billion in total land acquisition and development in 2020. We ended the quarter with 171,500 lots under control, as Ryan also mentioned, we are extremely pleased to report that 47% of these lots are controlled via option as we continue to make progress toward our goal of having 50% of our lots owned and 50% under option. Let me now turn the call back to Ryan. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. Let me offer a few final comments, before opening the call for questions. The strong demand that we experienced throughout the third quarter has continued into the first few weeks of October. At a very high level, we see demand continuing to benefit from a number of factors, including exceptionally low interest rates, the ongoing movement of millennials into home ownership and some level of desire to move away from urban centers. With COVID-19 forcing houses to now service home, office, school, gym, entertainment center and countless other functions, our ability to design homes can meet the expanded needs of today\u2019s buyers, gives us yet another competitive advantage in the marketplace. Before closing the call today, I want to make sure that we recognize and thank our employees for the tremendous work that they did in the quarter and throughout 2020 thus far. This has been a year unlike any other we\u2019ve experienced. As a Group, our team has done an outstanding job adapting to changes in both our professional and personal lives, while continuing to deliver a superior experience to our homebuyers. It\u2019s their commitment to our customers and to each other, which allowed PulteGroup to again be certified as a great place to work, and to be recognized as one of the 2020 Best Workplaces for Women by Fortune Magazine in Great Place to Work. In a world where the competition for the best talent is fierce, we view the strength of our culture as an important competitive advantage. And finally, many of you know, and I\u2019ve spoken with Deb Still, the President and CEO of Pulte Financial Services. Deb is an acknowledged leader in the mortgage industry, and was just named one of Denver\u2019s Most Admired CEOs of 2020. We want to publicly congratulate Deb. We are truly fortunate to have her as Senior Leader at Pulte Group. Let me turn the call back to Jim. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thanks, Ryan. We\u2019re now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Jamie, if you will now open the queue, and we\u2019ll get started. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Rehaut : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. Hope everyone is safe and healthy out there. First question I had was, and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but just trying to get a sense of the cadence \u2013 monthly cadence of order trends in the quarter. And I would say positive that you were able to see that strength continue into the first few weeks of October. I was wondering if that was more close to what you\u2019re seeing perhaps in terms of the exit rate or what you were seeing in September. And also any color around the active adult segment, if you\u2019re seeing any acceleration there as you noted to a strong order book or interest improvement? Ryan Marshall : Hey, Mike. It\u2019s Ryan. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll take the sign up question first. I think Bob shared in some of his prepared remarks, we saw very consistent sales order pace throughout all three months of the quarter. September was the exception to that where we started to see it slow down just a tad, but it was self-induced. So most of our divisions work to restrict sales either via price increases or lot releases or some combination of both and that was really an effort Mike, in order for us to make sure that we\u2019re not overly exposed on future cost increases within an elongated backlog as well as managing customer expectations. I\u2019d highlight the demand curve or the demand situation was quite consistent throughout all three months of the quarter. We\u2019ve seen things continue to be strong in the early weeks of October, both in the number of orders that we\u2019ve recorded as well as the demand. So things are continuing into the fourth quarter. And then finally, your question on active adult, we\u2019re really pleased with how that business has performed. We\u2019d lead highlighted in Q2 that it had been a softer part of our business given the age demographic of that buyer group, they were rightly so being very cautious because of COVID-19. I think as everybody has gotten more comfortable with PPE and social distancing, that buyer has come back into our sales offices and the things that I\u2019d repeat is we booked over 2,000 new orders in the quarter from our active adult communities, which is the highest that we\u2019ve had in over a decade. Michael Rehaut : All right. That\u2019s really helpful. And I appreciate you pointing that out. I guess maybe switching a little bit from the incoming order book to trying to get the units out the door. In your fourth quarter guide implies a backlog conversion rate in the mid-40s versus 59% a year ago. How can you say about the ability to deliver this, obviously, incredible backlog in homes over the next two or three quarters? Would you consider the year-over-year decline in backlog conversion as we see it in the fourth quarter is maybe being a low point in terms of the year-over-year differential and that from here we might be able to see that year-over-year decline narrow as production ramps? Or any type of forward-looking thoughts around the ability to obviously produce this tremendous amount of homes, how do you see that playing out? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, we\u2019re really pleased with how the production environment is running right now and as I highlighted on \u2013 in some of my prepared remarks, our production teams both the construction and the procurement teams have just done a real nice job of keeping things moving. So we\u2019re quite pleased with how things are rolling off of the production line. You\u2019ve probably heard me say before, Mike, we\u2019re not fans of backlog conversion. I think you can get some really goofy numbers. This is indicated by some of the percentages that you shared a minute ago. I really encourage you to look at conversion of units in production. I think it\u2019s a much better indicator of how efficiently the assembly line is working, and I think what you\u2019ll find with the guide that we\u2019ve given for Q4 is the conversion of our production is very consistent with where it\u2019s been over the last couple of years. As it relates to 2021, Mike, we\u2019re not giving any guidance on that at this point in time. We\u2019ll certainly try to do that as part of our Q4 call. Operator : Our next question comes from John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. John Lovallo : Hi guys. Thank you for taking my questions. So the first one, maybe getting back to the September orders that were sort of deliberately slowed down given pricing. I assume there is a different actions along those lines. I\u2019m curious, Ryan, what degree of pricing did it actually take to slow those orders? And if it is the $1,000 or $2,000, I think you may have mentioned during the call, given that labor costs are likely going up, the number is still high, structural spends are still high. I mean, as we move into 2021, is it likely that we\u2019re going to see margin degradation across the industry? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike \u2013 John, good morning. We haven\u2019t given any guide on 2021 at this point in time. You did hear us say, as it relates to lumber that that will be a headwind for us over the next several quarters, just because of the way we buy. We buy on a 13-week trailing random lanes average which means just kind of now in the back half of the third quarter and as we move into the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll start to see the higher lumber costs come into our margin profile. As it relates to your question about price increases and slowing sales, that\u2019s a tough thing to quantify in an answer on a call like this, John. What I\u2019d tell you is that we have been very successful in pushing price as evidenced by a very rich 24.5% margin print in this quarter. So we think we\u2019ve done a nice job managing the pricing environment. We are sensitive, however to that delicate balance of affordability. And so while I think we are maximizing what the opportunity is, I think we\u2019re being careful not to kind of break the affordability demand model. The last thing that I\u2019d probably highlight is that it\u2019s not just price. In some cases, we are managing the sales pace with the number of lots that we\u2019re releasing. So it\u2019s a combination of a number of factors that we can use to manage the number of sales that we want to take in an environment like this given what we\u2019re doing on the production side. John Lovallo : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe one for Deb. Deb, congratulations first of all, on your recognition. But the question is recognizing here that FHA and VA is I think 21% of your business relatively small, delinquencies at the FHA level are sort of mid-teens right now, nationally, I believe, I think the average is sort of mid single-digits. What are your views on sort of what happens across the industry when the moratorium on foreclosures ends at the end of the year? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, John, Deb\u2019s not on the call, but I\u2019ll try and answer that. It\u2019s Bob. It\u2019s a fair question. And I think the answer is that we\u2019re hopeful that there will be some sort of continued relief. I don\u2019t know that there is a big appetite today to introduce that kind of consternation into the market. If that were not to be the case, I think you\u2019d have some turbulence in the market. I don\u2019t know what that would translate into in terms of the current sales environment, but certainly it could create issues. Interestingly enough, most of the folks that own today have equity in their homes. So unlike the last downturn where people were upside down, one solution here is, people can sell their house and pay off the mortgage. So I don\u2019t want to be pollyannaish about it, but I\u2019m hopeful at least that this won\u2019t cause a lot of wreckage in the market. Operator : Our next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead with your question. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on the great quarter and glad to hear you\u2019re all doing well. So, Ryan, I would love to drill in as well on the kind of the limiting lot releases or sales activity in September that you guys signed. And I guess the first question on that is, what exactly has the trend been on your cycle times in terms of kind of what you\u2019re quoting buyers from contract to delivery time now versus say six months or so ago? And the follow-on to that is, I\u2019m a little surprised that you\u2019re taking such aggressive steps there just given how strong your community count is held up here and you mentioned actually being able to pull forward some openings which is impressive. So recognizing you\u2019re not quantifying the monthly trends. Is it still safe to assume that on a year-over-year basis you\u2019re able to grow the order book, given your impressive land position? Ryan Marshall : Yes, good morning Alan. There is a lot there. Let me see if I can kind of pick through some of that and give you some answers. As it relates to kind of the order trend over the quarter. The slight downtick in September was small. The year-over-year numbers in total for the quarter at 36%, they were fairly consistent as we moved, July, August, September. So I probably don\u2019t want to overplay that too much. The big takeaway that I think I\u2019d want you to have is the demand is great. To your point, we were successful in getting some communities opened a little earlier. And it\u2019s continued to kind of benefit our business not only in the current quarter, but certainly in future quarters as well. As it relates to cycle time, Alan, we\u2019ve been seeing things extend a little bit longer. It\u2019s not anything that I would characterize is overly problematic, but we\u2019ve seen the breaking ground to kind of finish delivery times expand just a tad. As far as when we\u2019re quoting deliveries Alan and in most of our system, it\u2019s right in the six-month range, which has been very consistent with how we\u2019ve operated the to be bill order model for a long time. So we\u2019re really not other than maybe a few specific communities here or there, we\u2019re quoting delivery times, it would be kind of in the March-April timeframe. And that\u2019s all reflective of what\u2019s in our backlog and what our lot availability situation looks like. So I may have missed a couple of the things you asked Alan, but maybe you can hit them in a follow-up if I missed anything. Alan Ratner : No, that was perfect, Ryan, I think you got everything there. And then secondly, if I\u2019m imagining this at the time of the year where you start to think about your next year budget and plans and probably are having conversations with your trades involved in that as well. And looking at the landscape out there, it\u2019s pretty clear starts need to accelerate rather sharply over the next few months. So any color you can give us in terms of conversations you\u2019re having with the trades in terms of how they are equipped to deal with this spike in activity that\u2019s likely to occur whether they are geared up for 2021 start activity. And I guess in the context of that, any comments you saw it leading builders of America kind of launched a new pilot program to try to improve some of the labor availability trend there as well. So any color you can give on that front would be great? Ryan Marshall : Yes, I\u2019d probably just expand a little bit on the prepared comments that I made, Alan, where labor is tight, and I believe that is a big builder, which we\u2019re certainly in that category. We\u2019ve got an advantage. The fact that we\u2019ve got a large backlog. We run a very sophisticated orderly shop in terms of start rate and how things move through the production environment. Our \u2013 what our trade partners tell us, is they appreciate that. They appreciate the consistency, they can send the same crews to the same community, every day. They know they\u2019ve got a consistent level of production, which helps them be more efficient, more profitable. So while things are tight, and I think we\u2019re going to continue to manage through things and absence this related to COVID, is the proverbial curveball that you\u2019ve got to be anticipating, things like that can certainly have disruption on a trade partner shop. We think we\u2019re pretty well prepared for not only the fourth quarter but for next year, and I give credit to our local teams that have built and managed and continued to foster the strong relationships that we have with our trade partners. So we think we are \u2013 as is evidenced by the guide that we\u2019ve given for Q4 on the closing front, we think we\u2019re in a good spot to finish out the year strong. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question. Ken Zener : Good morning, gentlemen. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Ken. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hi, Ken. Ken Zener : So what a year this is? I think a lot of people including myself, the rubber meeting the road, so to speak for the industry is that there\u2019s a lot of orders which to pay for that goes into backlog, but your actual inventory is what constraints your earnings fourth quarter as well as next year. So can you talk to this constraint, because your backlog to inventory ratio has never been lower at 3Q, it\u2019s about just under 80%, which is obviously leading to your fourth quarter guidance. But I think the big issue here is, your starts, what is the real constraint there? I mean, we hear constraints for appliances, I hear for windows, lately I\u2019ve been hearing it for garage doors, obviously Ryan, you commented on labor. But what is \u2013 it seems as though investors optimism around where starts can go seems to be at a bit of a disconnect from where the industry is able to produce homes? So what keeps \u2013 if you see all this demand, what really keeps you from accelerating that process somehow? I know we have longer construction cycle times, but what keeps you from starting more specs? Is it your land constraints? I know some builders run out of land for example to grow community counts, things like that, but what conservative nature that keeps you there or is it something that is industry wide that you really can\u2019t get around, therefore investors growth optimism might be too high as we look forward? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Ken, I wish that I could tell you that it was isolated to one thing. The reality is it\u2019s a lot of things and probably the first thing I\u2019d highlight is permits. So municipalities and government agencies have arguably probably been the most conservative in terms of shut down and slowdown. We can\u2019t start a home without a permit. And so that would be probably the thing that I would highlight has been the initial barrier that we\u2019ve got to overcome. I think we\u2019re doing a nice job doing that and then you go into the various production related kind of delays. You highlighted a number of them. We highlighted a number of them in our prepared remarks, where it\u2019s been appliances, it\u2019s been windows, it\u2019s been interior doors, it\u2019s been cabinets, none of them have persisted, but different things come and go based on a myriad of factors. And then you also highlighted lot availability. There are constraints around horizontal labor, land development labor as well, there is constraints around getting plat maps recorded and development plans approved through municipalities again. So there is a little bit of sand in the gears kind of everywhere, nothing that is completely shut the machine down and again I think that\u2019s where the big builders are favored because of our size and our scale in the processes and the systems that we have. We\u2019re able to really deliver some nice results as is evidenced by this most recent quarter. We\u2019re incredibly proud of what the business is doing. We\u2019re thrilled about kind of what we\u2019ve got projected for Q4, and as we finish up our planning for next year, we\u2019ll certainly provide some more guidance about 2021 as we get to the end of the fourth quarter. So I\u2019ve been in this business a long time, it seems that no matter the business environment that we\u2019re operating in, there are challenges that we have to deal with. This current time, no different. I can tell you right now though and I mentioned to some of my team over the past week, I\u2019d rather be dealing with these types of issues and small challenges been figuring out environment where demand is locking and you can\u2019t sell homes. So there are class problems, and I think we\u2019re well equipped to deal with them. Ken Zener : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning guys. Great quarter and thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to follow-up on community count. I mean, look, it actually increased sequentially and it was up 3% year-over-year. This is at the high end of the range that you guys were guiding to at the beginning of the year. Pretty surprising given all the pause during COVID, how stronger absorptions have been recently, just can you elaborate a little bit more on what\u2019s \u2013 what occurred internally in the muni level. I know you mentioned there is constraints at the muni level, but just kind of indicate otherwise. So hopefully you can walk through some of those moving parts, and then the sustainability of this 892 level as we look into 4Q or even first half of 2021? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Tru, it\u2019s Bob. We \u2013 obviously we gave a guide coming into the third quarter where we thought we\u2019d be down a little bit. The teams are working really hard as Ryan has shared with you. There was probably a degree of conservatism in that because people were just coming out of the pandemic, kind of real lock-down, when we were talking to you folks back in July. So really all we did was pull forward some community count out of what we thought would start in the fourth quarter into the third quarter. I don\u2019t know that there is the ability to continue that through time and so yes, we\u2019ve done a refreshed look and we think actually our Q4 is going to be consistent with what we told you back in July. We had said it began down to 2% to 4% in July for the third and fourth quarters. So we are still there. We\u2019re obviously working hard to get stuff open. We obviously haven\u2019t provided a guide beyond the fourth quarter. But there is a limit to how much pull forward you can do. And so again teams did a great job. We don\u2019t think it repeats in the fourth quarter, but we will make every effort. Truman Patterson : Okay, okay. Thank you for that. And then just jumping over to the land market today with you all bumping up your land spend. How would you characterize land market? Is it overheated, just normal conditions that\u2019s generally pretty competitive. And are there any metros of concern that is specifically gotten over heated lately? Ryan Marshall : Truman, it\u2019s Ryan. I\u2019d characterize the land market is competitive, which other than maybe in the depths of the great housing recession, the great recession. Truman Patterson : Yes. Ryan Marshall : I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever seen land go on sale. It just doesn\u2019t. And there is a finite number of pieces that are within kind of the zones that are allowed to be kind of developed entitled, et cetera. And I think we see competitive behavior there, whether it\u2019s from other homebuilders or you\u2019ve got commercial and other uses for most good land parcels. So I wouldn\u2019t characterize it is anything other than competitive. We\u2019re continuing to be smart. We\u2019re sticking to our underwriting fundamentals and the way that we have kind of approached land investment, so really no deviation from us on that front. And I would tell you, I don\u2019t know that I would characterize any markets has been \u2013 specific markets has been overheated and irrational at this point in time. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much guys. I think it\u2019s pretty unusual market right now where it seems like your ability to sell is pretty much just limited by the available product to sell? And so in that regard, I\u2019m curious as to how to think about what Pulte\u2019s max production capability is and how to sort of think about forecasting what that might be next year? So one way that I could think about it is that you\u2019ve given a guide of 6,900 deliveries in the fourth quarter. If I just sort of multiply that by four, would it be reasonable to think that that\u2019s your max production capacity right now? Or should I be looking at your \u2013 the orders you took in 3Q and say you probably wouldn\u2019t have taken those orders if you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to deliver on with good customer service and so maybe 4 times that number is kind of your max capacity? How should I be thinking about max capacity and how much do you think it can grow in any given year for a builder of your size? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, that\u2019s \u2013 all of those are difficult questions to answer, because they are essentially all 2021 guidance, which were not given at this point in time. I\u2019ll do my best to give you a little bit, and what I would tell you is that the business, both from a sales standpoint as well as a production standpoint it\u2019s seasonal. We see seasonal fluctuations in demand. We see seasonal fluctuations in what our max capacity is, mostly driven by weather. You know that we\u2019ve got a very big Midwest business and it gets more difficult to build homes in the middle of winter in the Midwest. We certainly do it, of course, but it\u2019s not as good or as fast in the summer months. So we really like the way that the production machine is running right now. We\u2019d certainly endeavor to increase that as much as we\u2019re able based on having available land and available trade resources and rest assured. We\u2019re working on that every single day to get our start rate up, because to your point, the demand environment is great. But like I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we think the better way to evaluate the efficiency and the efficacy of the production machine is a conversion of what\u2019s in production. And we think we\u2019re operating at a very consistent historical level as it relates to that. So look, we\u2019re going to do everything we can to put more into the machine and that\u2019s on both fronts, both the vertical side as well as on the horizontal landside. Stephen Kim : If I hear you on the Midwest and the northern parts of the country, being a little bit more difficult to produce and seasonality therefore, but in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s one of those quarters where it gets pretty cold up there, and you\u2019ve given a number there. So and I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re pretty much going lights out now, trying to build as much as you possibly can. So I mean kind of think that that number of times 4 is probably not a bad guess as to what your max capacity is today. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. And I\u2019m really trying to get at what your ability is to grow capacity in any given year and what does the things that actually are the limitations on that? Is it in your view, well, unless I shouldn\u2019t ask you what they are? It\u2019s more like what the number might be? Is it reasonable for example to think that a company of your size can grow capacity \u2013 production capacity on a sustained basis by about 20% a year? I mean is it unreasonable. Just wanted to understand, because it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve never really thought about before. Frankly you always thought about it on from the demand side. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, I think the best thing that I can give you is that we\u2019ve given the guide that we\u2019ve given for Q4 from a delivery standpoint and we\u2019re quite happy about that. We\u2019ve given community count guide that Bob just talked about in earlier question for Q4 as well. So I think you\u2019ve got probably as good a insight into the demand environment as probably we do and based on what we\u2019ve talked about. So I think you look at those things and you factor that into kind of your models for future years, what I\u2019ll tell you is that we are \u2013 we\u2019ll give kind of a more robust guidance for 2021 at the end of the fourth quarter. So we are \u2013 as I mentioned a minute ago, we\u2019re really seeking to grow our starts. We think that this environment favors the big builders. And so we\u2019re going to continue to endeavor to do that. I think the limiting factors are the same that they\u2019ve been and probably is consistent with what you\u2019ve heard from us in the past, it\u2019s land and labor. So can we continue to grow the labor force? We\u2019re trying to do that. And you heard a comment from Alan leading builders of America has got an effort under way, where we\u2019ve created a foundation that is solely focused on promoting the wonderful career opportunities that are available within the homebuilding industry. So we\u2019d hope to get some traction with that to increase the labor side land. I think the biggest impediment there is frankly the municipalities and working through the development system. And then lastly, and I think probably I\u2019d rank it third on the list is there is a little bit of stickiness in the supply chain. Again, nothing that we haven\u2019t been able to manage through, but it does create a little bit of stickiness. Operator : And our next question comes from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Su. Susan Maklari : My first question is thinking about the active adult segment and the obvious improvement that you\u2019ve seen there over the quarter, how much of that do you think is coming from what we\u2019re seeing in the existing market the fact that some of these areas like the Northeast, the Midwest that were soft prior to this have really seen an improvement in there, and it\u2019s just become a lot easier for these people to sell their existing homes and get into these newer units? And I guess with that to, are you seeing geographic shift? Are you seeing a lot of people that are coming out of the northern half of the U.S. in the active adult segment and going into some of these Southern markets? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Susan. I think there is a couple of things going on. We are seeing a continuing trend of folks leaving Northeastern and Midwest markets and they\u2019re moving South. That\u2019s a trend that was going on pre-COVID. It\u2019s a trend that\u2019s continued post-COVID. So we continue to see that benefiting our business given that we\u2019ve got a lot of properties in the South. As it relates to the active adult consumer, we think there is a couple of things going on there. One, this buyer has gotten more comfortable in resuming normal daily activities over the last couple of months and that includes figuring out what they\u2019re going to do in retirement. So we think we\u2019ve benefited from that buyer reengaging in the buying process. And then the comment that I made in my prepared remarks, our view is that a healthy housing environment requires all consumer groups to be participating. And certainly, we\u2019re seeing that right now, given the desire, the increased desire of individuals to have a single-family home, it\u2019s created an inventory shortage really in every price point of the market, it\u2019s created some pricing opportunities not only for us, but also for the resale side, and that\u2019s made it easier for individuals to sell their home. They\u2019ve sold their homes at really great prices, which gives them a lot of options and a lot of choices in terms of what they do on the new side. So I think what all that adds up to is a great operating environment for our company. Susan Maklari : Got you. Okay, thank you. And my next question is around the buybacks. I think it was really encouraging to hear that you are reinstating that program in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about the cadence of the buybacks coming back? What\u2019s given you the confidence to do that? And how you\u2019re thinking overall about capital allocation, and especially maybe as we think about the accelerated pace of demand, the need to keep supplying those lots in supporting the growth and just how you\u2019re balancing all those different factors looking out? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Su, it\u2019s a fair question. As Ryan mentioned on the call, we\u2019ll give you news on what we\u2019ve done after we\u2019ve done it as opposed to giving you a guide in terms of what our expectations are for spend. But the way we\u2019re looking at share repurchases is exactly the same as we were prior to the pandemic. And so our capital allocation process starts with investing in the business. To your question, that will be our primary source or use of capital. Second, we want to fund our dividend. Third, if we have excess capital, we will use it to buy back shares. Again all against the backdrop of leverage and cash capacity and so with $2 billion in the bank and a business that has strong cash generating right now, we can kind of do all of those things. I know we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, our expectation based on the guide we gave you as for spend, $800 million to $900 million on land acquisition development. In the fourth quarter we\u2019ll pay our dividend, we think we\u2019re cash generated after that. And so the $2.1 billion of cash probably gets bigger. We\u2019ve talked about that, that we\u2019ve got a maturity in the first quarter of next year that we are still likely to use cash to redeem, so 426 or $7 million. But with all that said, we still have a lot of capacity to invest in the business than we think actually to buy back stock. So we always use that lens. We always look out in time as we\u2019re thinking about the used sources and uses of capital in the business. So we don\u2019t see it is a choice between how do we want to invest in the business or buyback stock. We will be doing both. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Dahl from RBC. Please go ahead with your question. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk more about kind of the pricing power and dynamics you\u2019re seeing. I think you mentioned 1% to 3% price increases. I understand, it\u2019s widely vary, but wanted to get a sense on a relative basis. You talked about the constraint at the entry-level from an affordability standpoint, but on average is your entry level pricing increases trimmed in line or above or below those numbers that you\u2019re quoting? And I guess the second part of that question is, when you talk about the constraints, are we talking true or hard bumping up against FHA, VA limit at this point or is that more just a feel on moderating and metering out your price increases to avoid sticker shock? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: To your second question, Mike, it is the latter. So it\u2019s an affordability question, not a mortgage capability question. Now interestingly, our business and we\u2019ve talked about this before, even in that first-time space, we are typically a little bit at the higher end of the price range there. So it was mentioned earlier on the call, FHA, VA for us is and has been pretty consistently about 20% of our origination. So we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t have a lot of consumers at that lower FICO score where you might be getting up against the capability to borrow. So I think at the end of the day as we look at it, it\u2019s just trying to make sure that we\u2019re pricing appropriately, but not pushing things so far that people have a choice. People always have a choice. And whether it\u2019s rental or competition, you don\u2019t want to get the affordability equation for that more a cost conscious buyer out of lack. Mike Dahl : Got it, okay. And then the second question I had, you touched on lumber impact starting to hit in the fourth quarter, but as you articulate mostly kind of a first half issue. Could you just size up sequentially, what\u2019s the margin headwind that you\u2019ve got to absorb in 4Q versus 3Q? And I know you don\u2019t want to give 2021 guidance, but based on that lag and your backlog, you do likely have a sense of the magnitude that\u2019s coming at the beginning of next year. So any color you can give us on kind of how that steps up from 4Q to 1Q in terms of just what you\u2019ve got to absorb from a pricing standpoint to cover lumber? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike. We haven\u2019t broken that out. What we have talked about is that lumbers, about the sticks packages about 3% to 5% of our cost. So it\u2019s a meaningful percentage, but we haven\u2019t \u2013 3% to 5% of ASP is what the sticks packages. So it\u2019s a decent chunk of money. I think what you saw in the fourth quarter is that we\u2019ve had some nice price appreciation that we push through the system. We had a really nice margin in the quarter. We\u2019ve given kind of our margin guide for Q4, which we\u2019ve said is going to be consistent with Q3. So I think what you\u2019re seeing is that we\u2019ve been able to offset the increases that were coming through the system because of lumber with prices. As it relates to Q1 of next year, we haven\u2019t given any guidance on that yet, but we certainly will as part of our Q4 release. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen with that we\u2019ve reached the end of the allotted time for today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference call back over to Jim Zeumer for any closing remarks. Jim Zeumer : Hey, we appreciate everybody\u2019s time today. If you\u2019ve got any questions, certainly feel free to get back in touch with us through email or calls, and we will look forward to talking to you on our fourth quarter call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with that we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I want to highlight that we will be discussing our reported fourth quarter numbers as well as our results adjusted to exclude the impact of certain reserve adjustments and tax benefits recorded in the period. A reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financial results is included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance. Also, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I appreciate everyone joining today's call. I hope that your New Year has started well and that you are -- and that you remain healthy and safe. It goes without saying that COVID-19 and the resulting challenges made 2020 a year, unlike any that we've experienced before. Let me just say right up front that I'm extremely proud of how our entire team responded and how our organization remain engaged and focused during some very difficult times.  Thanks to the sustained efforts of our dedicated team, we successfully navigated through a year that started strong, slam to a halt and then accelerated into the strongest demand environment this industry has experienced in more than a decade. As you read in this morning's press release, PulteGroup completed an exceptional year by delivering outstanding fourth quarter results that included a 24% increase in orders, a 220 point increase in gross margin and a 31% increase in adjusted earnings per share. We also ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and a net debt-to-capital ratio below 2%.  Reflecting a lot of hard work by an amazing team PulteGroup realized a 6% increase in full year closings to 24,624 homes and a corresponding 7% increase in full year home sale revenues to $10.6 billion. Benefiting from our ability to expand homebuilding gross and operating margins, along with dramatic gains in our financial services business, we converted the 7% top line growth into a 29% increase in pretax income of $1.7 billion. Our outstanding results extend beyond our income statement as we generated $1.8 billion in operating cash flow in 2020, after investing $2.9 billion in land and development during the year.  Beyond investing in land, we increased our dividend by 17%, effective with the payment we made this month and repurchased $171 million of our common shares in 2020, despite having suspended the program for 6 months because of the pandemic. I'm also extraordinarily proud to note that consistent with our focus on generating high returns over the housing cycle we realized a 23.7% return on equity for the year. With 2020 complete, we enter 2021 in a strong financial position and with numerous opportunities to drive further business gains. Obviously, we can't control how the pandemic plays out, but we are optimistic that the multiple vaccines getting distributed mean that we can see a light at the end of this long tunnel.  Bob will provide specific guidance as part of his comments, but let me offer a view of how we are looking at the business and how we plan to operate in the year ahead. We expect a strong demand environment, which the housing industry experienced for much of 2020 and in reality, for many quarters prior to COVID, can continue well into 2021. We said for years that we thought housing starts needed to be around 1.5 million to meet the natural demand created by growth in population and household formations. We finally reached 1.5 million starts in 2020, but we have underbuilt relative to this number for years. Given this unmet need and the potential mix shift in demand toward more single-family and away from apartment living, we believe demand can remain strong going forward for our business. Beyond the demographic tailwind, we also believe that the pandemic has caused a permanent increase in the number of people who will be working from home full or at least part time. Such a shift has profound implications in terms of what people need from their homes as well as where their homes can be located. For example, we believe a remote working dynamic expands the buyer pool because it can allow people to purchase more affordable homes in further out locations. At the same time, working from home has the potential to increase the intent to buy new homes, which offer floor plans and technology features that better meet the needs of today's homebuyers. With such a strong demand environment, it works to our advantage to be among the nation's largest builders with access to land, labor and material resources.  We enter 2021 with more than 15,000 houses in backlog 180,000 lots under control of which half are controlled via option and long-standing relationships with suppliers and trade partners. The combination of these factors should allow us to increase 2021 deliveries by more than 20% over last year. As we've demonstrated over the years, I am confident in our organization's ability to operate the business successfully and to get homes built. But I do think it's fair to acknowledge that there are points of friction in the system. Labor remains tight, although the change in administration may allow for some relief, assuming immigration policies are eased. At the same time, product manufacturers are battling supply chain issues and the occasional COVID-related disruption within their plants. Although I must say our suppliers have been tremendous partners, going above and beyond in many instances to provide the materials we need.  Given high expectations for the company's operating performance and our balance sheet strain at year-end, I believe we are exceptionally well positioned to execute on all of our capital allocation priorities. More specifically, we are targeting land acquisition and development spend of $3.7 billion in 2021. This is an increase of roughly $800 million over our 2020 investment, but we think appropriate given the growth in our operations. Beyond our expected land investment, we have made great progress in planning for and selecting the location of our next off-site manufacturing plant. We still have a few details to work out with the owners of the sites under consideration but we hope to finalize a plant agreement within the next couple of months and then begin installing the requisite production equipment later this year. Our ICG operation in Jacksonville has exceeded our expectations so we are excited to get this new plant up and running sometime during the first quarter of next year.  Along with investing in the business and continuing to fund our dividend, as you read in this morning's press release, we will be using available cash to pay down $726 million of our outstanding debt in the first quarter. And finally, we will continue to return excess funds to shareholders through our share repurchase program. In response to the uncertainties caused by the pandemic, we had suspended share repurchase activities during the second and third quarters of last year. As detailed in our press release, we resumed the program and repurchased $75 million of stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to $171 million. We have repurchased more than 1/3 of the company's shares since initiating the program, and we expect to remain an active buyer of our shares going forward. Housing demand was outstanding in the back half of 2020, with strength across all geographies and buyer segments. And I'm certainly pleased to report that this strength has continued unabated through the first few weeks of January. The housing industry has been extremely fortunate in being an economic engine, but we do not take this for granted, nor will we forget how devastating COVID-19 has been for thousands of businesses and millions of people. It is certainly our hope that we are rapidly approaching the end of this pandemic.  Let me now turn the call over to Bob. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my best wishes and express my hope that we can all navigate the coming year in health and safety. As indicated in our press release, our fourth quarter financial results were impacted by the following items : a $16 million net pretax benefit from adjustments to insurance-related reserves; a $22 million pretax charge from adjustments to financial services reserves; and a tax benefit of $38 million resulting from energy tax credits and deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments.  Where appropriate, I'll reference the impact of these items during my review of the quarter. For our fourth quarter, home sale revenues increased 5% over last year to $3.1 billion. The increase in revenues for the period was driven primarily by a 4% increase in average sales price to $446,000 and as closings were up 1% to 6,860 homes. The increase in average sales price for the period reflects a strong pricing environment for all buyer groups. We're pleased to report that on a year-over-year basis, our average sales price was higher for our first time move-up and active adult buyer groups. The demographic mix of our closings moved slightly in the quarter and reflects changes caused both by the pandemic and by our strategic investment to serve more first-time buyers.  Consistent with these dynamics, our fourth quarter closings in 2020 consisted of 32% first time, 46% move up and 22% active adult. In the fourth quarter of 2019, closings were comprised of 31% first time, 45% move up and 24% active adult. Our net new orders for the fourth quarter increased 24% over last year to 7,056 homes, while our average community count for the period was down 2% from last year to 846. The decrease in community count reflects the slowing of our land activities earlier this year in response to the pandemic as well as the faster close out of communities due to the strong demand environment and related elevated absorption paces. Demand was strong across the entire period and actually accelerated toward quarter end as December orders were higher than November and essentially flat with October.  Given the strength of ongoing demand, our divisions are taking specific actions, manage sales pace and production, so our backlog does not get overextended. We are also being thoughtful about adjusting price to help cover rising house costs especially the cost of lumber, which moved significantly higher in the quarter. Consistent with what we experienced during the third quarter, demand was strong across all of our brands, including the ongoing acceleration in demand among active adult buyers. In the fourth quarter, first time orders increased 27% to 2,084 homes, move up orders increased 17% to 2,994 homes, while active adult orders increased 33% and to 1,978 homes.  In fact, our Q4 active adult orders were less than 100 units below the all-time quarterly high we reported in the third quarter of this year. After a pause in the first half of 2020, active adult buyers have clearly gotten off the fence. Our fourth quarter cancellation rate was 12%, which is down from 14% last year. Based on the strength of our sales, our year-end backlog increased 44% over last year to 15,158 homes. Backlog value at year-end was $6.8 billion compared with $4.5 billion last year. We believe our large backlog and continued strong demand for new homes has the company extremely well positioned to realize significant year-over-year growth in closings in 2021. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had a total of 12,370 homes under construction, of which 1,949 or 16% were spec. In the fourth quarter, we focused on closing sold inventory, but we're actively working to increase production of sold and spec homes throughout our markets. Our large backlog makes this process a little easier, and we're working closely with our trades and product suppliers to ensure the needed capacity to deliver more homes going forward. With 12,000 -- 12,370 homes under construction at year-end, we expect deliveries in the first quarter of 2021 to be between 6,300 and 6,600 homes. At the midpoint, this would be a 20% increase in closings over last year.  This growth rate is in line with what we expect for the full year as we are targeting deliveries to increase approximately 22% to 30,000 homes for all of 2021. Given the strength of our move-up in active adult sales, along with price increases realized across all buyer groups, our average sales price in backlog was up 4% over last year to $448,000. Based on the prices and backlog, we expect our average sales price on closings to be in the range of $430,000 to $435,000, both for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. As we've said in the past, the final mix of deliveries can influence the average sales price we deliver in any given quarter. Reflecting the benefits of the favorable pricing environment and our ongoing work to run a more efficient homebuilding operation, our fourth quarter gross margin of 25% was up 220 basis points over last year and 50 basis points from the third quarter of this year.  Driven primarily by increases in lumber and labor, our house costs will be higher in 2021. However, given strong demand conditions, we expect to pass-through most of these costs through increased sales prices. As a result, we expect gross margins to remain high and be approximately 24.5% for both the first quarter and the full year. Our reported SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was $280 million or 9.1% of home sale revenues. Excluding the $16 million net pretax benefit from adjustments to insurance-related reserves recorded in the fourth quarter, our adjusted SG&A expense was $296 million or 9.7% of home sale revenues.  Last year, our reported fourth quarter SG&A expense was $262 million or 8.9% of home sale revenues, excluding an insurance reserve adjustment of $31 million last year, our adjusted SG&A expense was $293 million or 10% of home sale revenues. At the outside of the pandemic, we took action to adjust our overheads in anticipation of a more difficult operating environment. Although nearly all furloughed employees have rejoined the company, and we have hired back many of the employees we released, we still expect to realize improved overhead leverage in 2021. At present, we expect SG&A expense in the first quarter of 2021 to be in the range of 10.5% to 10.9%, which is down from 11.9% last year.  For the full year, we are targeting an SG&A expense of 10% of home sale revenues, down from 10.2% on an adjusted basis last year. Our financial services operations continued to deliver strong results as we reported fourth quarter pretax income of $43 million, which is up from $34 million last year. It's worth noting that our fourth quarter 2020 results include the $22 million pretax charge from adjustments to our mortgage origination reserves as we settled claims tied to mortgages issued prior to the housing collapse. The increase in pretax income in the quarter from our financial services business reflects continued favorable rate and competitive market conditions, along with higher loan volumes resulting from an increase in mortgage capture rate. Our mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 86%, up from 84% last year. Our reported tax expense for the fourth quarter was $86 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 16.4%, and which reflects the tax benefit of $38 million, resulting from energy tax credits and deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period.  In 2021, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.5%, including the benefit of energy tax credits we expect to realize this year. Finishing out my review of the income statement, we reported net income for the fourth quarter of $438 million or $1.62 per share. Our adjusted net income for the period was $404 million or $1.49 per share. In the comparable prior year period, the company reported net income of $336 million or $1.22 per share and adjusted net income of $312 million or $1.14 per share. Benefiting from the outstanding financial performance and resulting cash flows generated by our homebuilding and financial services operations, we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash. In addition, at the end of the year, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 29.5%, which is down from 33.6% last year, and our net debt-to-capital ratio was 1.8%.  In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million common shares at a cost of $75 million or an average price of $43.69 per share. For the full year, the company returned $171 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 4.5 million common shares at a cost of $37.58 per share. As noted in our earnings release, we expect to pay down $726 million of our outstanding senior notes in 2 separate transactions during the first quarter of this year. First, we'll exercise the early redemption feature effective February 1 on $426 million of senior notes originally scheduled to mature on March 1 this year. In addition, we initiated a tender offer this morning for $300 million of our 2026 and 2027 senior notes, which we expect to complete on February 26.  Assuming full execution of the tender, the retirement of the $726 million will save the company approximately $34 million in annual interest charges and on a pro forma basis, lower our gross debt-to-capital ratio to 23.7%. In the fourth quarter, we invested $942 million in land acquisition and development which brings our full year 2020 spend to $2.9 billion. As Ryan mentioned, given our positive view of the market and the expected strong cash flow generation of the business, we currently expect to increase our investment in land acquisition and development to $3.7 billion in 2021.  And finally, we ended the year with slightly more than 180,000 lots under control, of which 91,000 were owned and 89,000 were controlled through options. I want to highlight that based on these numbers, we've effectively reached our stated goals of having 50% of our land pipeline controlled through options. And given our guidance targeting 30,000 closings '21 we've also reached our goal of having 3 years of owned lots. Land acquisition can be lumpy, so the numbers could move around, but we remain disciplined in our investment practices and focused on enhancing returns and reducing risks through the use of options.  Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. When I took over as CEO in 2016, there were several areas where I saw an opportunity to enhance our long-term business performance. Among the targets we put in place were to expand first time to be 1/3 of our business, to lower our lot position to 3 years of owned lots, to control 50% of our land pipeline via option, and increase our growth rates while continuing to deliver high returns for our shareholders. Given our 2020 performance and our expectations for 2021, it is gratifying to say that we've achieved these initial goals with this foundational work in place, we can now continue developing an even more successful business as we expand our operations, advancing innovative customer-centric technologies and integrate new construction processes. Our outstanding 2020 results in combination with continued strength in housing demand, also has PulteGroup entering '21 with tremendous momentum. We begin the year with our largest backlog in well over a decade, along with great operating metrics and a strong balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to capitalize on market opportunities. These opportunities include the expansion of our off-site manufacturing capabilities that I spoke about earlier as well as the geographic expansion of our homebuilding operations. I'm sure that most of you saw last week's press release that PulteGroup has established new operations in the Greater Denver area. At the same time, our Raleigh division is extending its reach and establishing a presence in the TRID area of North Carolina, which includes the cities of Greensboro, Winston Salem and Burlington. We have our initial land positions in place, and we're working quickly to increase our lot pipeline in these new areas.  We are excited about the opportunities we see in both markets as well as several other cities we are currently evaluating. With our goal to increase closings by more than 20% this year, along with investing $3.7 billion in land and our expansion into new markets, we believe we are well positioned to grow our operations while continuing to deliver high returns.  In closing, I'm extremely proud of what our organization accomplished in 2020. The and I want to thank all of our employees for their efforts toward delivering an outstanding homebuying experience and homes of exceptional quality. I also want to thank our suppliers and trade who are working tirelessly to provide the resources needed to successfully run our business. We entered 2021 with high expectations, but I know the pandemic continues to rage and so we will continue to operate our business thoughtfully and safely.  Let me turn the call back to Jim. James Zeumer : Great. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call to questions. So we can get as many questions completed as possible during the remaining time of this call. [Operator Instructions]. And now let me ask Andrew to again explain the process and open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets. Michael Dahl : Nice results. Brian or Bob, I guess first question really is around land investment and in away capital allocation as well. Not to turn our nose up at an $800 million increase in land spend this year, it does seem like you guys are maintaining your typical balance when you're thinking about the debt paydown, the potential for share repurchases. A lot of your peers have started to more significantly ramp up land investment, just given the strength in demand and potentially some shortfalls in community counts coming. How do you think about this current environment and your allocation to land investment relative to your more balanced kind of through-cycle mentality? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. A couple of things that I would share with you. Number one, I would orient you to the fact that we've maintained for the better part of the decade that we're running a balanced business through cycle, where we want to invest in land, first and foremost, and grow our business, but there are other parts of capital allocation that we believe create long-term value. We are taking a pretty big step-up in our land spend this year, as I think we've highlighted this morning, going to $3.7 million. It's a big bump from where we were at in 2020. Certainly, there were some delays in '20 that have rolled into '21. But even adjusting for that, we think it's a pretty big step-up. We are going to continue to be very thoughtful and responsible in making sure that we're driving the types of returns that we know create long-term value. We just don't believe that now is the appropriate time to get into -- back into the mentality where all available cash is funneled into land. The last thing, Mike, I'd tell you is that we do -- while we don't peg our land investment specific to this number, we do think about land spend as a percentage of revenue. And we think the numbers that we have allocated and projected for 2021 are an appropriate step up, reflective of what is a very strong market. Michael Dahl : Okay. My second question goes to the margin side, and you clearly had success in terms of utilizing price and controlling costs to drive margin expansion. I think you alluded to margins potentially being slightly lower than the 4Q levels and mostly being able to offset the increase in-house costs. Could you just elaborate more on kind of magnitude of the increase in costs, maybe on a per square foot basis or however you want to quantify that, that you're expecting to come through the P&L?  And also, if you could share some sort of kind of price per square foot that you've been able to achieve, just help us understand that balance between price cost a little bit better? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, it's Bob. I think important to remember, we're starting from a very strong margin position and certainly, in the fourth quarter, we got the benefit of some spec sales, and we don't have a ton of spec on the ground today. So as we're looking forward into the year, what we're trying to project is where are the sales prices that we've contracted. But we recognize that our house costs are going up. We are projecting them to be up in the neighborhood of 5% next year in fiscal '21. So that's inclusive of commodity input cost and labor. So a little bit richer increase than we've seen for the past couple of years. Obviously, the market is strong. We think we can get most of that price back. The other thing we are cautious of is affordability, and we want to make sure that we've got pricing that people can actually afford to close on. So our teams are doing a nice job of managing that price equation as we're out in market. So the guide for the year at 24.5% again, reflective of a very, very strong environment. And -- but we do recognize, especially with lumber, having risen so rapidly that there'll be a little bit of pressure on margins with that. Operator : The next question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Ivy Zelman : And congrats on a strong year in the fourth quarter. Maybe, Ryan, you can help us better understand when you think about the $3.7 billion of acquisition land acquisition development, spend, even excluding COVID, we hear a lot from municipality or builders complaining, we want affordable housing, just not in our backyard. And just thinking about some of the constraints on getting lots developed is there anything that can change with maybe whether it's some type of tax incentive to developers? There's a lot of focus on the demand side by the Biden administration. But do you think that it's not a constraint that appears to be and you're overcoming that? Or is there something that has to change to continue to build more shelter for this country with municipalities being a bottleneck? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Ivy, and thanks for the question. I think you've touched on an item that, frankly, we've been talking about as an industry and as a company for a while, and you hit the nail on the head. I think all municipalities want more affordable housing and shelter as they work to grow their job base and grow their own local municipalities and economies. But you nailed that they want it as long as it's not next door or 2 existing residents or other folks that are already there. So I believe that's more a local issue than it is a national issue and -- but that being said, I do think a tone from the top, from the administration can certainly help to influence what local municipalities do.  So look, there are challenges out there, but one of the things that I think we highlighted is our size. And I think the talented team that we have, we're working through what is a challenging environment out there, and we are able to get our land entitled. We are able to get it developed, we are able to get investment. If things were a little easier, I think you could do even more. But we feel very comfortable about the numbers that we've put forward for 2021. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Bouley of Barclays. Matthew Bouley : I wanted to follow-up on the margin side. So guiding gross margins up 20 basis points in '21 despite this pricing environment. I'm just wondering if there's any, I guess, other margin headwinds that we should be aware of beyond that increase in-house cost, you just mentioned, Bob. So I'm thinking whether it's the mix of option lands that's come up and maybe now coming through? Or perhaps more first time closings expected? Just what else might be sort of playing into the puts and takes there on that guide? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Matt, I don't think there's anything really dramatic. Obviously, land is more expensive, each successive lot as the vintage gets kind of worked through, you're bringing more expensive land on as the market has appreciated through the years. So that's a contributor. Other than that, I mean, we've got a very large backlog. We've got pretty good visibility into what our margins are going to be. And in candor, we contracted these houses 3 months ago and so the pricing environment isn't fully reflected in our sales right now. So you see that kind of on a little bit of a lag with us. We actually like that because it puts us in a position where we can understand our house cost going into it when we're contracting. But we do have a little bit of a lag in terms of where the pricing environment is right now versus what is closing for us, for instance, in the first quarter. Matthew Bouley : Okay. Understood. That's helpful. Second one, just around selling pace. I think I heard you say that December ended up even stronger than November. And correct me if I misheard you, of course. But just obviously, Pulte, like many others, ending the year running faster than usual. Last quarter, you guys talked about sort of intentional slowing of pace. Do you think you have the capacity at this point to see further uptick on selling pace into Q1 as normal? And I guess, I think you mentioned January sort of continued unabated. I guess any additional color there would be helpful as well. Ryan Marshall : Matt, it's Ryan. We did have a very strong fourth quarter. And you heard correctly, December sign-ups were up over November and equal to what we did in October. And I think for those of you that have been following the industry for as long as you have, that's atypical. Normally, you see a seasonally downturn October to November, November to December. So I think it's reflective of how strong the demand is. And then January is off to a very good start. So we did, in the majority of our divisions manage the number of sales that we were allowing to be sold either via lot releases or price increases or some combination of both. And that's really about making sure that we're matching our sales rate to our ability to produce homes.  We've significantly increased the production capacity that we have. So I think we're doing a nice job working through that. And then the other factor that you've got to think about is lot availability. So we factor all of those things into our sales release and our pricing strategy. And all of those elements are reflected in the guide that we've given for the full year. So it's -- look, as I highlighted in some of my prepared remarks, it's a great time to be in the homebuilding business. And I think there are a number of really strong demographic and economic trends that are going to continue to help support this industry. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Yes. Good quarter. I was really intrigued by some of the things that give a glimpse into what could be coming. One of the interesting things, I think that you pointed out is that you have a build-to-order model, which suggests that what we saw in the fourth quarter doesn't really fully reflect the environment, which it sounds like it was pretty enormously strong in the fourth quarter. So it looks like that's still yet to come. And so in that vein, I wanted to ask you about your outlook for pricing and, therefore, implicitly margins. We couldn't help but notice that your order price this quarter was extremely strong. And relative to the price that you are forecasting or your outlook for price for the full year next year. I just did a quick analysis of that going back through time. And we have never seen anything like the kind of decline that you're calling for in your full year '21 closing price relative to the order price that you took this quarter.  And in your commentary, everything seemed to suggest that there is actual momentum building in price. And so I just wanted to talk to you about what is embedded in that? Is there a significant mix shift of more entry-level communities that you are embedding in that assumption? And are you not seeing what other builders seem to be seeing, which is consumers actually paying up for more options and upgrades, which your BPO model would capture and even a preference for larger homes. Because your guidance would seem to suggest that's not happening nearly to the degree that you're going to have a negative mix shift. It's kind of curious. So I was wondering if you could address that. Ryan Marshall : Stephen, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. There was a lot in there to unpack, and I'll try and touch on the key elements. And if I miss anything, we'll come back and grab it in a follow-up. But we are seeing a robust pricing environment, as I think we've highlighted, as it relates to the pricing, the ASP guidance that we've given for the full year, it is being largely influenced by the increasing amount of first-time business that we have coming through our business, along with geographic mix. So as you know, we build in kind of coastal locations like Northern California, Southern California, et cetera. And so the load of closings that come out of those divisions relative to other places in the country can certainly have an influence on ASP.  As it relates to pricing and our ability to take price I think, Stephen, you know that we've long talked about our strategic pricing methodology and how that has been a large contributor of the company's outperformance in margin relative to the competition. So certainly, we feel that will continue to be a real strength for the company. We're operating in the same market that I think everyone else is and so there's not really any reason to believe that we wouldn't benefit from the uptake in demand and the ability to push price. Stephen Kim : Yes. I certainly would agree with that. It's just that maybe we haven't seen it as quickly in your numbers just because you have a build-to-order model, but that should also allow you to capture, I would think, if anything, a little bit more price. Because you give your comes the ability to option. In that regard, we've seen a couple of other builders report so far that our spec builders and in both cases, we -- well, so far, we've seen margins for the spec builders surprise to the upside even versus what they had thought a couple of months ago. And when we dig into that, some of it, obviously, is pricing, but some of it is also that cost per square foot seems like it didn't go up as much as they might have thought. And part of the reason for that is because they found that they're building somewhat larger homes.  And that the somewhat larger homes have an actual lower cost per square foot because there's only 1 kitchen and only 1 roof and all that kind of stuff. So you get more efficiency when you build a slightly larger box. I was curious if you're seeing any of that and if you have incorporated any of that into your thinking about what cost per square foot will be over the next 6 to 12 months? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen. So we've certainly factored into the guide that we've given what we believe the product mix will be. But within a given community, the offering that you could have -- could easily range from -- just as an example, 2,000 feet to 3,300 feet. Within that, there might be 4 or 5 floor plans, and you don't know what plan the customer is going to choose until they come into the sales office. So we have made some assumptions. I think as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we're seeing customers do different things based on their current their current living situation, their work from home situation, the need for more space, more space for school, more space for home gyms, et cetera.  So there's -- I think there certainly is a story to be told that there are some bigger homes being built. To your point, I'd agree with you, bigger homes are a little bit more efficient. So time will tell. We've factored in what we think are our best assumptions at this point in time, and we'll continue to keep everyone updated as the year progresses. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Rehaut of Jpmorgan. Michael Rehaut : And congrats on the results. I wanted to circle back to gross margins, and I apologize that this is beating a dead horse a little bit. But just wanted to try to get a better sense of the levers here. And you hit on price. But when you look at the 25% margin in the fourth quarter, it was up a little bit versus the guidance of 24.5%. And now you're also looking for 24.5% in the first quarter and -- of '21 and the full year of '21. So I was just curious, number one, what drove that differential? And if it was more temporary or mix driven per se? And number two, when you think about price versus cost inflation, I think a lot of builders have been looking towards some decent level of gross margin expansion in '21 versus '20. Given your margins being so much higher historically over the last few years than most of the other builders, I'm wondering if there's any upward limitations on taking price from an affordability perspective or a competitive perspective, if that's why perhaps we're not seeing as much expansion in '21 versus '20, just given the higher starting point? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. I think it's apples-to-oranges to a certain degree, in terms of us versus others. So I can't comment on their relative margin performance. And Mike, there's clearly nothing that prevents us from accelerating price if it's available in the market. And if that's expansive to margin, we're going to do it. I think we've demonstrated, and you saw it actually in fiscal '20 versus the prior year, we were up that 25% was up 220 basis points over the prior year. So we're paying attention to market, and we're looking to get every dollar of price that we can.  I think in terms of the forward guide, we've got 15,000-plus homes in backlog, right? We kind of have pretty good visibility into what our margin profile is going to look like next year. There is nothing, and I want to be clear about this, nothing that will stop us from trying to expand that margin. But based on what we see today, we want to give you the best estimate we've got. And as I said in answer to an earlier question, we do see vertical construction costs escalating. Lumber, I think everybody is aware of. It's a busy market out there. There's a lot of people selling a lot of houses. We think there'll be some price on the labor side that we'll be asked to contribute for that.  So at the end of the day, we are pretty -- we're pleased with our margin profile. We'll seek to try and push it to the extent that we can get more price going forward. And if that more than covers the increase in costs, including land, I think you can see us do that. And there's no message here, but we outperformed in this most recent quarter. If the opportunity is there, we'll seek to do the same going forward. Ryan Marshall : And Mike, on the Q4 outperformance, I just -- you asked where did that come from, we mixed in more spec inventory in Q4 than we had anticipated. And so there's a good example of we were able to get kind of current market pricing that help provide some outperformance in Q4. Michael Rehaut : Thanks for that, Ryan and Bob, that was very helpful. I guess, secondly, I just wanted to focus a little bit on community count and sales pace. And your community count in the second quarter, just down a touch year-over-year. Which was relatively positive, I think, versus some of your peers having much greater declines. At the same time, you've made comments, I believe, around -- and correct me if I'm wrong here. But to a degree, perhaps managing sales pace to make sure you're not getting too far ahead of your backlog and allowing your business to operate at a relatively consistent cadence. How should we think about '21 on those metrics?  And specifically, community count, if you could give any directional guidance for the first quarter and where we should expect year-end to wind up. And to the extent that you've kind of limited or managed your sales pace, could we expect sales pace in '21 to be more kind of consistent even off of these levels?  Obviously, again, you're not seeing in your numbers, maybe the dramatic year-over-year growth on some of your peers. And I'm just wondering if that could actually work towards your benefit as you get through the next few quarters? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. So I think the question sort of is what's the community count for next year? And how are we thinking about sales against that? And the way I think we ask you to think about community count, we obviously had a slowdown in development spend this year, even some delayed AC. We've highlighted that we're going to be investing at a more aggressive rate next year, Ryan walked through that. Where we see it is community count in Q1 of '21 versus Q1 of '20 is down about 5%. And then if you fast forward to your question at the end of the year where do we think we'll be? We'll be down about 5% kind of end of year '21 versus end of year '20 will have some variability in that during the year, and it will be dependent on what's the sales environment like? How quickly are we closing out of communities? And what's the weather like, how does development go?  We'll obviously be looking to accelerate communities as much as we can. But the sales environment is going to drive some of that number too. And we are looking at a pretty big step-up in acquisition spend next year, which would obviously contribute to years beyond that. Operator : The next question with apologies to Ms. Zelman, a follow-up or second question for her from Zelman & Associates. Ryan Marshall : Maybe I thought we hit I scared you away with my last answer. Ivy Zelman : Yes. No, a follow-up. Ryan Marshall : It was Zeumer's fault, right? Ivy Zelman : Yes, Zeumer, right. It was Zeumer's fault, there you go. Just digging in a little bit on the land spend. You think about spending $3.7 billion. Are you spending -- are you fully set up for '22? Or are you still buying for '22? And how far out are you buying? And just give us just the perspective between the margin differential on the option lot versus on the own lot? If there is a differential from a price perspective and margin perspective? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Ivy, both good questions. We're pretty well set up for most of '22 at this point. Some of the spend that will happen in '21 will influence the back half of '22, but we're mostly set up. So given the difficulties that you highlighted in your first question with entitlements and approvals and things like that, we're largely into 2023 at this point in time. And we've factored that into kind of everything that we're doing. In terms of -- and the second part of your question, I lost my train of thought on that one. Ivy Zelman : The option -- the option margin or price differential? Ryan Marshall : Yes. So Ivy -- the thing I or -- Ivy Zelman : I know you focus on returns, and I recognize that. And I see it a faster return, we'd be the option or a better return. But just thinking about the pricing in the market, the land grab right now is pretty heated. So what are you seeing if there's a differential when you're optioning lots and what that may be from an impact to gross margin, even if it's a better return? Ryan Marshall : Yes. So I don't want this to come across as the nonanswer, Ivy, but you highlighted the most important point, which is we underwrite the return every single deal we do has got very different characteristics depending on who the seller is. As a general rule of thumb though, there is a cost to doing options. They're not free. And we factor that into what the ultimate return is and the overall kind of risk reward balance that we think we're getting for the option. So Bob, anything else you'd highlight on that. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: The 1 thing I'd add is that in terms of the optionality, there's a couple of ways that, that manifests self, right? Are you doing a finished lot option transaction or are you tying up a bigger parcel where you're saying, all right, I want 1/3 of the lots today, 1/3 of lot 2 or 3 years from now and 1/3 of lots, 2 or 3 years after that. Remember, we're trying to manage against market risk as much as anything else. And so I don't think that the kind of the step-up is as impactful on margin because of that as opposed to just doing a straight finished lot option deal. So if you're in a master plan because they're getting real-time retail pricing for taking all that risk for you to take just-in-time lot delivery. So I don't know -- if you look at the book, a lot of our transactions are more what I've described as having these are larger lot positions that's just more than we need right now. And so we're paying a little bit for people to carry the land but then we might even be developing the land. It might not even be an option of finished lots. So I don't think it's a deleterious from a margin perspective as some people think sometimes when they're looking at it is exactly the way you just did. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Zener of KeyBanc. Kenneth Zener : To make sure I was connected. Great quarter. I mean, your leverage is flat. Your returns on capital, or as I look at our returns on inventory, are very high. So you should be investing in your company like you're doing. So I have 2 questions. First, go over your logic for this 50% owned option target and how much does del web legacy land play into that? And then my second question, is you're a build-to-order builder, yet your start capacity is limiting your orders. Perhaps. So what does that mean for your kind of start capacity? I mean, you started about 7,500 homes. We can calculate your starts basically. So what is your 30,000 guidance reflect in terms of where your quarterly capacity is going? Ryan Marshall : Ken, so I'll maybe take the start capacity question first. And we feel good about how our production machine is running. We have ramped it up almost every single quarter, and we continue to do so. And that's the guide that we've given for full year deliveries are reflective of the pace that we believe our production capacity is on certainly, if we can do more, we'll work to do that, and we think the demand environment is there that would allow us. But there's a lot of moving parts in that, labor capacity, supplier capacity, et cetera. So in addition to that, Ken, and I think everybody knows, we've long believed that the build-to-order model is better for a number of reasons, and it's the 1 that we've chosen to largely employ but specs are a big part of kind of what we do as well, especially with our entry level, lower priced product. And so in addition to building our sold not started backlog, we're also in increasing the number of specs that we have in the system. I don't believe that the build-to-order model is limiting our ability for success because at some point in time, you've got to make a decision about how much you can build. Whether you build that as a sold or you build that as a spec, you still got -- you've got to put the start on the ground at some point in time. So we're in a great time right now. We're excited about the prospects for 2021. And if we can keep some of the wins at our sales here, I think we're going to have a great year.  Andrew, are you still there? Who is next in the queue? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: The . Is 9 :30. Could they have timed it. Ryan Marshall : Andrew? [Technical Difficulty]. Yes. Jim, I got a confirmation from a couple of folks that the audience can still hear. So it sounds like it's an operator challenge. James Zeumer : So if anybody wants to -- we're still here. So if anybody wants to text me a call or text me a question, we'll do our best to take it that way because I'm not sure where our operator disappear to. I'm not sure at this point in time in terms of technical difficulty, how we're going to solve this. But again, we'll give it another couple of minutes if anybody wants to e-mail me a question or text me a question, I'm happy -- we're happy to answer it. And I apologize for this confusion. Operator : I guess it's just a are this is the conference operator. It looks like we're experiencing some technical difficulties. I'm going to go ahead and take over the call for now. It seems we were in the middle of our Q&A session. Is that correct? Ryan Marshall : That's correct. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from Jack Micenko with SIG. John Micenko : It's always Zeumer's fault, isn't it? Ryan Marshall : Jack, I think this one, we can actually let Zeumer off the hook. I'm not sure he had anything to do with this. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: He was running around with wire cutters, but I don't know what that so now your next in the Q? Jack? John Micenko : Probably, probably. All right. So we got a huge backlog. You've got great visibility into it. The industry has seen backlog conversion rate come down, not surprisingly coming out of some of the unique things we dealt with in 2020. It looks like the 1Q guide is calling for continued pressure on backlog conversion historically, which tells me there's a ramp in the back half of this year to hit that 20% growth. Can we unpack some of the drivers that I think Bob talked about increasing spec in the prepared commentary but kind of what gives you confidence you can sort of build back some of that backlog conversion in the back half of the year while maintaining margin? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Jack, it's Ryan. We tend to look at our conversion of work and process inventory as opposed to backlog. So we do have a larger backlog than we ordinarily carry, which is reflective of the strong sales environment. From a production standpoint, we're running very comparable to what we've historically run in terms of work and process conversion. And what I can tell you without giving you specific numbers is the daily, weekly, monthly start rates are increasing, working through that sold not started backlog and the spec inventory such that we feel like the guide that we've given for the full year is very achievable.  So it's not necessarily a huge bet on a bunch of incremental spec inventory, which I think you may have been alluding to a little bit. Certainly, we want to put more in there, but it's really reflective of getting through the sold not started backlog in addition to putting some more spec in the ground. Our cycle times are a little elongated, given some of the disruptions in the supply chain. I think the areas where there's some -- a little bit of sand in the gears from a product standpoint or probably fairly widely known. I'd highlight that the relationships we have, the size of our company, the talented procurement team that we have. We've done a really nice job working through that, but it is a challenge that is out there for sure. John Micenko : And then you've got you've got the 1 plant down in Jacksonville. You're bringing another 1 online, I think early online early '22, right? How should we think of -- where will that show up in the numbers? Is that going to be at a company level, is that going to be gross margin? Is it going to be G&A ratio? Maybe lower warranty reserves over time. Where can guys like outside looking and kind of expect to see the benefit of that in the model? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Jack, I'll let Bob take that one. And maybe what I'll do is I'll highlight the benefits that we think we're going to get out of these plants. And the reason that we bought the first one, the reason that we're expanding to the second one, we're getting huge increases in our cycle time efficiency, which is a big deal and the labor efficiencies that we're picking up are tremendous as well. You combine those things with the added cost benefits that we're getting, and we're very pleased with how these off-site manufacturing facilities are performing. So as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, Jacksonville's exceeded our expectations. We're on the plant number two. We're in the final stages of site selection and just working through some contract things. So we're excited about the prospect of what the future of this holds, and then I'll let Bob touch on where you can see the numbers. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Jack, it's in homebuilding. Obviously. And so you'll see, I think, a couple of impacts. One is the contribution from the business itself. It's on the margin line, it's consistent with not a little bit better than our building our homebuilding operation. And then you obviously have the benefit, we believe, in terms of both the cycle time that Ryan talked about. But even some cost benefit to the builder side of the business, so the actual divisions contracting with them. And then there is a cost to do in this, but it's not out of line with the rest of our business. So I think it -- for all intents and purposes, you won't see it impact things materially other than that we get the improved operations that Ryan was talking about. James Zeumer : Operator, I think we have time for 1 more call, if you're still there. One more question if you're still there. Operator : Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : My first question is really around the active adult business. You saw another nice lift there. Quarter. I think, Ryan, in your comments, you kind of mentioned the fact that it feels like that buyer is definitely out there. Can you just give us a little bit of color on what you're seeing in terms of the demand trends there? How you're thinking about that coming through? And how much of this do you think is really being driven by the fact that maybe the existing market in some areas in the country, like maybe the Northeast and other parts that weren't as strong prior to COVID have really kind of picked up and allow these people to kind of get out of their homes and make that transition? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Susan, and take the question. I think there's a number of things that are benefiting the active adult buyer right now. One is they were first to kind of go to the sidelines they've certainly got more comfortable figuring out how to buy and figuring out how to make the decisions that they want to make as it relates to the retirement. The strong stock market behavior, I think, certainly plays a factor in that as retirement accounts are our flush. And then finally, the strong resale market has made it a seller's market, and so very easy for that active adult buyer to sell their existing home and move into 1 of our new communities. So our expectation is that the Webb brand will continue to be a big part of our business, and that buyer will continue to perform very well. Susan Maklari : Okay. And my follow-up question is around capital allocation. You started to buy back some stock in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit to how you're thinking about that for '21? And any kind of color you can give there? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Susan, the stance that we've taken on stock buybacks is that we'll report the news. What we have highlighted is it is going to continue to be part of our capital allocation. We paused for the second and the third quarter given the pandemic. But as you saw in the fourth quarter, we reinitiated a $75 million level. So we will be active throughout 2021. We're not going to provide forward guidance on the amount of the spend rather at the end of each quarter, we'll share with you what we've done. James Zeumer : I think we've now kind of run out of time, and I apologize for the technical difficulties for it. We'll certainly look forward to getting back to everybody over the course of the day. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to talking to you on our next earnings call. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Q1 2021 PulteGroup, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James Zeumer. Please go ahead. James Zeumer : Thank you, Sarah, and good morning. I want to thank everyone for joining today call to review PulteGroup's operating and financial results for our first quarter ended March 31, 2021. While it has only been a year, our Q1 2021 earnings call will obviously be very different discussion than we had this time last year. I'm joined on today's call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slide that accompany today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of this call later today. Before we get started, let me highlight that in addition to reviewing our reported first quarter results, we will also discuss our adjusted results, which exclude both a $61 million pre-tax charge associated with a debt tender completed in the quarter, and a $10 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in the period. For purposes of comparison, we will also discuss prior your Q1 earnings adjusted for a $20 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge. A reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financials is included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. We encourage you review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance. As always, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Jim, and good morning. As detailed in this morning's release, our financial results show exceptional first quarter performance for PulteGroup. From double-digit growth in signups, revenues, and earnings to enhanced liquidity and a $1 billion expansion of our share repurchase authorization we posted a tremendous start to 2021. Beyond company specific gains, our first quarter results reflect the ongoing strength of homebuying demand throughout all segments of our business. It is worth highlighting that I believe the strength of the market is due in part to a significant housing shortage in this country. That shortage has been years in the making and will take years to correct. I think the first two sentences from a recent Wall Street Journal article aptly summarize the current state of housing supply in the U.S. The U.S. housing market is 3.8 million single family homes short of what is needed to meet the country's demand according to a new analysis by mortgage finance company Freddie Mac. The estimate represents a 52% rise in the nation's home shortage, compared with 2018, the first time Freddie Mac quantified the shortfall. Beyond this long-term structural shortage, COVID-19 has also resulted in a growing desire for single family living and has changed what homebuyers want and need from their homes. We believe these new wants and needs are often best met through the floor plans and features available on new construction. Add these dynamics do supportive demographics, low interest rates, and an improving economy, and you get the tremendous demand environment we're experiencing today. The strength in demand is reflected in our strong order growth for the quarter. In total, our net new orders were up 31% over the last year, while our absorption pace was up 37%. On a unit basis, this was the highest [first quarter finance], we've reported in over a decade and at $4.6 billion, our highest reported quarterly sales value ever. I would highlight that the strong demand we experienced in the first quarter of 2021 has continued into the first three plus weeks of April. We continue to see high traffic volumes in our communities and buyers anxious to purchase a new home. Working within the strong demand environment, we continue to improve our operating and financial performance. Our pricing strategies and disciplined business practices helped us to generate a gross margin of 25.5%, and an adjusted operating margin of 14.6% in the quarter. The resulting cash flows were then available to fund the future growth of our business and an increase in our ongoing return of excess capital to shareholders. At a very basic level, this is the model that we have been refining for the past decade. It starts with running a higher performing homebuilding operation, seeking to capture incremental gains in all areas of the business. It also includes investing in high quality projects and increasing our use of land purchase options to improve cash flows, and overall asset efficiency, while delivering consistently strong returns on investment and equity. Having built a home building operation that we believe can routinely generate strong returns and cash flows, we then allocate capital to support our long-term success and reward our shareholders. As we have highlighted many times, our highest priority is investing in our business through the acquisition and development of land assets that can generate required risk adjusted returns. To that end, since 2016, we have invested $14.6 billion in land acquisition and development and have done so while building a more efficient land pipeline. To clearly demonstrate the progress we have made, at the end of 2016, we own 99,000 watts, while controlling an additional 44,000 watts via option. Today, we actually own 5,000 fewer lots than five years ago and have more than doubled the lots we hold via option to 100,000. This significant and continuing change in the composition of our land pipeline has allowed us to increase the returns we generate while also helping us to reduce land related market risk. As you know, we've also made the return of funds to our shareholders an integral part of our capital allocation. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve returned approximately $3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including $154 million of stock repurchased in the first quarter. On that front, I am happy to note that this morning's announcement that our board approved an increase of $1 billion to our repurchase authorization. And finally, as you saw in the first quarter, we were also prepared to allocate capital with a view towards further strengthening our balance sheet and reduce in our financial leverage. By paying down $726 million of debt in the quarter, including the successful tender for $300 million of our nearest dated outstanding debt, we were able to lower our debt-to-capital ratio on a gross basis to 23.3%. To be paying down debt and returning significant funds to shareholders, while targeting a 30% increase in our land acquisition and a development in 2021 says a lot about our expectations for the earnings power and the financial strength of this business. I think it also reflects a more return oriented shareholder friendly approach toward operating our business.  In fact, I think there is an ongoing maturation of the broader homebuilding industry in terms of its ability to generate higher returns with reduced risk. Given changes in the industry's operating and return profile, we believe investors can grow increasingly comfortable about investing in the sector over the entire housing cycle. With the opportunity for sustained high levels of housing demand, I believe PulteGroup's unique operating strategy has us well positioned to compete and to continue to grow our business. Beyond the financial strength that I discussed, I believe that our size and diversity provide important advantages. For example, a key driver to our order growth in the first quarter was the ongoing recovery in demand among active adult consumers. A year of being separated from their kids and grandkids has been more than enough for this buyer group. With vaccinations now moving into high gear, our active adult buyers are anxious to get on with their lives, including moving into a new Del Webb community. In conclusion, 2021 has gotten off to an excellent start for our company. With ongoing strong demand that exceeds available supply, a backlog value of $8.8 billion and our tremendous financial strength and flexibility, I am excited about what we can accomplish this year. Let me now turn the call over to Bob. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan and good morning. Jumping right into our operating results, home sale revenues in the first quarter increased 17% over last year to $2.6 billion. The higher revenues for the period reflect the 12% increase in closings to 6,044 homes, coupled with a 4% increase in average sales price to $430,000. While home closings for the period were up more than 12% over last year, deliveries came in slightly below our guidance with the shortfall resulting primarily from the severe weather in Texas. 4% or $17,000 increase in average sales price realized in the quarter benefited for price increases across all buyer groups and was led by a 6% increase in ASP for our active adult closings. The buyer mix of closings in the first quarter is comparable with the prior year and included 33% from first time buyers, 43% from move up buyers, and 24% from active adult buyers. As Ryan mentioned, our net new orders in the first quarter were up 31% over last year to 9,852 homes. We experienced strong demand across all geographies and buyer groups with notable ongoing strength among our active adult buyers. In the first quarter, orders among our first time buyers increased 39% to 3,303 homes, while move up orders gained 18% to 4,040 homes and active adult voters increased a robust 49% to 2,509 homes. 49% year-over-year increase in active adult closings reflects the impact of the slowdown in sales in the last two weeks of March last year. But I would highlight that the 2,500 active adult orders this year represent a first quarter high dating back almost 15 years. I would also point out the buyer demand was consistently strong during each month of the quarter even when interest rates increased during the period. The 31% increase in orders could have been higher, but our divisions continued to actively manage sales in the quarter to match production rates and to help maximize project specific returns. Along with raising prices and a 100% of our communities to help cover cost inflation and moderate sales, all of our divisions used [flat releases] to more directly manage sales in some or all of their communities. For the first quarter, we operated from an average of 837 communities, which is down 4% from last year's average of 873 communities. The year-over-year decline in community count is consistent with our prior comments and reflects the impact of our decision to slow land spend when the pandemic first hit in March of last year along with the accelerated closeout of communities resulting from the ongoing elevated pace of sales. Consistent with the overall strength of the market, our cancellation rate in the quarter declined by more than 500 basis points from last year to just 8%, and we ended the quarter with a backlog of 18,966 homes, which is an increase of 50% over last year. On $1 basis, our backlog increased 58% to $8.8 billion. On a year-over-year basis, we increased the number of homes we started in the quarter by 25% to 8,364 homes, which helped to raise our total homes under construction by 22% to 14,728 homes. Of these homes, 1,798 or 12% were spec units, which on a percentage basis is down slightly from the fourth quarter of last year. Given market conditions, we have continued to work with our trade partners to further increase productions and expect to increase overall starts to at least 10,000 homes in the second quarter of this year. This would be an increase of at least 20% over the first quarter of this year. Based on the stage of construction for the 14,728 homes currently under construction, we expect deliveries in the second quarter to be in the range of 7,400 to 7,700 homes. At the midpoint, this would be an increase of 27% in deliveries over the second quarter of last year.  Based on the ongoing strength of buyer demand and with almost 19,000 houses in backlog, we are raising our guidance for full-year closings to 32,000 homes. This is an increase of 7% from our prior guide of 30,000 homes and represents a 30% increase in deliveries for the year versus the prior year. The strong pricing environment has helped to lift the average sales price in our backlog by 5% over last year to $465,000. Given the backlog ASP and the anticipated mix of deliveries, we expect our average closing price in the second quarter to be in the range of $440,000 to $445,000. For the full-year, we now expect our average closing price to be between $450,000 and $455,000. Our homebuilding gross margin for the first quarter was 25.5%, which is an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year, and a sequential gain of 50 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in gross margins, which exceeded our prior guidance, benefited from the exceptionally strong pricing environment for sold and spec homes, and for the mix of homes close to the period. In addition to the 4% increase in year-over-year ASP, our gross margins also benefited from lower sales discounts of 2.5% in the quarter, which represents a decrease of 110 basis points for the same period last year, and a decrease of 50 basis points for the fourth quarter of last year. As has been well reported, material and labor costs continue to move higher being led by lumber prices, which now seem to reach new highs every day. While we now expect our house costs, excluding land to be up 6% to 8% for the year, the strong demand environment is allowing us to pass through these costs in the form of both higher base sales prices, and lower discounts. Given these cost price dynamics, we expect gross margins to move higher throughout the remainder of 2021. As a result, we expect to realize sequential gains of approximately 50 basis points in each of the three remaining quarters this year, which would have us in the range of 27% for the fourth quarter of 2021. In the first quarter, our reported SG&A expense was $272 million or 10.5% of home sale revenues. Excluding the 10 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in the period, our adjusted SG&A expense was $282 million, or 10.9% of home sale revenues. This compares with prior year SG&A expense for the quarter of $264 million, or 11.9% of home sale revenues. We are adding people to handle our higher construction volumes, but we still expect to realize sequential overhead leverage with the second quarter SG&A expense in the range of 9.9% to 10.3%.  And for the full-year, we now expect adjusted SG&A as a percent of homebuilding revenue to be approximately 9.8%. As Jim noted, we did record a $61 million pre-tax charge in the period relating to the cash tender offer for 300 million of our senior notes that we completed in the first quarter. Turning to Pulte Financial Services, they continue to report outstanding financial results with pre-tax income more than tripling to $66 million, which compares to $20 million in the first quarter of last year. The large increase in pre-tax income reflects favorable competitive dynamics in the market, as well as higher loan production volumes resulting from the growth in our closings, and a 150 basis point increase in capture rate to 88%. Tax expense for the first quarter was $90 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 22.8%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than our recent guidance, primarily due to benefits related to equity compensation recorded in the period. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.5% for the balance of the year, including the benefit of energy tax credits we expect to realize this year. In total, for the quarter, we reported net income of $304 million or $1.13 per share. Our adjusted net income for the period was $343 million or $1.28 per share. In the first quarter of 2020, the company reported net income of $204 million or $0.74 per share, and adjusted net income of $219 million or $0.80 per share.  Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. On a gross basis, our debt to capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 23.3%, down from 29.5% at the end of the year as we use available cash to pay down $726 million of senior notes in the first quarter. Our net debt to capital ratio was 5.5% at the end of the quarter. Along with paying down debt during the quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million common shares at a cost of $154 million for an average price of $46.11 per share. As Ryan mentioned, given the strength of our business and expectations for continued strong cash flows, and with our existing repurchase authorization down to approximately $200 million at the end of the quarter, the Board of Directors approved an increase of $1 billion to our repurchase authorization. The return of excess capital to our shareholders remains a priority and as such, we expect to remain a consistent and systematic buyer of our shares. In the first quarter we invested $795 million in land acquisition and development, including the lots we put under control through these investments, we ended the first quarter with approximately 194,000 lots under control, of which 94,000 were owned and 100,000 were controlled through options. With 51% of our lots now controlled via option, we have surpassed our initial target of 50% owned and 50% optioned, and expected that the percentage of option lot can move even higher. Consistent with our outstanding financial results, I'm pleased to report that earlier this month, Standard & Poor\u2019s upgraded PulteGroup\u2019s debt to investment grade. This means that our senior notes are now rated investment grade by Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch. It's been a long process, but I'm extremely proud of the improvements we've been able to achieve in our credit metrics. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan. Ryan Marshall : Thanks Bob. Before opening the call to questions there are two final topics that I want to quickly review. First, as one of the nation's largest home building companies, we recognize and accept the important responsibilities we have to continue advancing sound ESG policies. In today's world success is judged not just by what we do, but also considers how we do. As such, along with actively working to improve how we operate, we're advancing our associated environmental, social, and governance reporting. To that end, along with all of our other accomplishments, in the first quarter, we launched a new section of our website called Pulte Cares. In addition to housing information on our efforts to run a sustainable business that supports the communities we serve, the site also contains our reporting against the sustainability accounting standards board\u2019s standards for our industry. This is the first year reporting against the SASB standards, and we look forward to showing our progress in future updates we'll be posting to the site. Finally, I would like to give a big shout out to the entire PulteGroup family for being ranked on the Fortune 100 list of Best Companies to work for. Since the founding of our company, we have viewed our culture as a critical and competitive advantage. The Fortune 100 list is built on an analysis conducted by the great place to work organization, which is based on employee surveys from thousands of companies. In our case, they surveyed 100% of our employees. To make the Fortune 100 list is an accomplishment, but to make it for the first time when we are operating in a global pandemic is clear and resounding statement about our people and the culture they have built inside of our organization. I truly could not be prouder of our company and specifically of our field leaders who do so much to support our people, and help them to be engaged, especially during these challenging times. My heartfelt thanks to all of you. Let me turn the call back to Jim. James Zeumer : Great, thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions so we can get to as many as possible during the remaining time in this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Sarah, you can now open the call for questions. We'll get started. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC. Please go ahead. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Congrats on those accomplishments on the results. My first question is on active adults, it's good to see that buyer group continuing to rebound. I'm curious, you know, as you look at the buyers that are coming in the door today, is there any change in buyer profile that you're seeing kind of post-COVID now, whether it's where are these buyers coming from? What features are they looking for in the homes? What amenities are they looking for in the community? Is this any anything that you're seeing that may or may not be different will be great to hear? Ryan Marshall : Thanks for the question, Mike. And just to clarify your question about buyer profile is specific to the active adult consumer or about all consumers? Mike Dahl : Specific to active adult. Ryan Marshall : Yeah, really no change, Mike, in the makeup of that buyer group, the places they're coming from, and the things that they're asking for, I think largely remain the same as what we've experienced over the last, you know, four to five years. Mike Dahl : Got it. Okay. My second question is, is around the margins, that's a great trajectory through the year and I was hoping, you know, when we think about, kind of the cost inflation guide relative to the margins, if you could give us a sense of how that cost inflation trajectory looks, because it would seem like, you know, by the time you get to 4Q, you may, maybe this isn't going to [be peak], but you may be at kind of peak cost inflation yet you're guiding to a gross margin north of 27%, and maybe you can just give a little bit more color on that trajectory of costs alongside the pricing and margin curve to give us a better sense of that? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, Mike, just to clarify, you know, if you add the sequential 50 basis points per quarter that would get us to around 27, not north of 27, in terms of the margin. And certainly what we have seen is an acceleration in cost lumber being the primary driver of that. I think everybody is well aware, it's at all time highs. You know, we're hopeful that supply will come to that market, and that pricing will wane somewhat.  You know, we've been waiting for that and haven't seen it yet. But, you know, we have updated our guide in terms of what the inflationary aspect of the sticks and bricks is, you know we've been at or near 5%, 6%, we're now at 6% to 8%. And depending on what lumber does, that could move a little bit even higher than that.  Having said that, you know, we've got a really strong pricing environment right now. It's accelerated through the year. And so as we look at the production and our build out for the year, we see being able to cover those cost increases, enough, obviously, to lead to that 50 basis point, kind of sequential movement in margin through the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys, good morning. Congrats on the great results. You know, Ryan, I'd love to drill in a little bit more, in terms of your expectation for starts to accelerate to over I think you said 10,000, in the second quarter, it's certainly encouraging because I think that there's probably a view out there that, you know, the only thing really limiting orders at this point is production. And, you know, recognizing there's some seasonality in that start number. You know, if you just kind of annualize that, it would seem like you're gearing the business up to produce a lot more homes, and you're going to deliver this year. So, I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about, you know, how you're getting that starts growth, you know, that 20% sequential improvement? Are these new labor relationships that you're forming? Is it just the trades, ramping up hiring and production from that standpoint? Is it anything related to the, you know, the vertical integration that's perhaps improving your efficiency there? And then just tying in cycle times, and how those have been trending into that discussion, as well would be great? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Alan, good morning. It's Ryan, I appreciate the question. We are proud of the quarter and we're very excited about how the balance of the years is shaping up. We've been working hard on the production environment for the last, you know, two to three quarters, as we always do. But you know, certainly in this period of time, when we've got unprecedented demand, the production machine becomes more important than ever. We do believe that the size of our business, the way we run our business, the relationships that we've nurtured and fostered with our trade partners over the years are really paying dividends for us. And that's the, you know, Alan, that's the primary driver. This led us to, you know, the point where we can make the 25% plus increase in production in Q2, you know, moving to Q1 rather, and then moving to almost 10,000 units in Q2. So, we're very pleased with how the production machine is moving. It's not without its challenges, and Bob's highlighted some of those on the cost front. We're certainly seeing some challenges, you know, with certain commodities, windows, appliances, a few things like that. But, you know our procurement team has done just an outstanding job in managing some of those minor speed bumps in the road You know, last part of your question Alan about cycle time, we are seeing in certain markets, you know, some incremental days being added to the overall cycle time because of some of those supply chain constraints, but we believe we've factored all of those into the guide that we've given for not only Q2 closings, but also, you know Q2 start rates. Alan Ratner : Great. And on that point, you know, I know you guys are not, you know, huge spec builder, but I'm just curious if you've changed your sales approach at all given, you know, those cycle times extending, given the cost environment, are you, you know, perhaps waiting more until the home is framed or started before starting up before selling homes or are you still, you know, kind of in the mix of your business, perhaps is it still a lot front loaded before the home is started? Just trying to get some insight into whether you're concerned about visibility into costs and things like that, when you're starting the sales process? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Alan, we're certainly concerned about the cost increases and that, you know, I think Bob's answer to the prior question highlighted that, you know, we've \u2013 it's part of the reason that we've moved our guide in terms of expectations on cost increases up, because, you know, things are getting more expensive. We are in certain consumer groups, most notably, in the lower price points, we are waiting to sell those homes later, starting them with specs, and we're waiting to sell those as they get later into the production cycle. You know, it's really allowing us to do two things, we're getting kind of current day sales price, and we've got better understanding on the delivery timing, and you know, what the cost of those homes are? The other thing I would add, Alan, it was a question that was part of your first question, and that's around our start rate, and whether or not you know, we're ramping up for more deliveries, and it's really about our spec inventory. We've historically run around 25% to 30% of our total production volume of spec, you heard in Bob\u2019s prepared remarks that we're running at 12% today. And so part of the incremental start rate will be to rebuild that spec pipeline that we'd like to carry. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. The first question I had was just on some of your comments around April, and you know, how to think about the current demand backdrop, you know, you mentioned that you're seeing continued strength into the month, and you have many builders right now that are managing pace that could be selling stronger than they allow for, you know, but you know, obviously, you have still often managed pace with production. So, I\u2019m curious, you know, in terms of the strength that you've seen into April, if the first quarters pace is something that, you know, given what you're seeing in the marketplace, you think might be sustainable, because typically you do have a 5%, roughly 5% decline in sales pace in to 2Q due to seasonality. I'm wondering if, you know, if [your comments] on April, and just the overall demand backdrop, we should be expecting, you know, the current sales pace of nearly four per month to continue into the second quarter? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Mike, it's Ryan. Good morning. And where we typically see seasonality in Q2 is into the May and June part of Q2. April generally tends to be fairly in line with March. We've seen, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we've seen the first three weeks of April continue in a very strong fashion. So, you know, time will tell what kind of seasonal adjustment we see in May and June.  We're not giving any kind of a forecast on that. I think you've heard from us and a number of other builders that have recently reported that demand is really strong, and we've had to limit sales in nearly every community, either via lot release or price increases or in most cases, both.  So you know, we'll have to see how the, you know, the back two months of the quarter play out when you take into consideration unprecedented demand, along with, you know, what's been a historical or slightly seasonal fall off. But you know, all things, all other things being equal, Mike, the business environment right now, is incredibly strong for a number of reasons. And you know, it's a good time to be a homebuilder. Michael Rehaut : Great. No, I appreciate that. Second question, you know, on all the progress with the gross margins, obviously very impressive. You know, the 27% exit rate this year would, you know, start to match your prior peak gross margins from the last cycle, if you were to annualize it, you know, it's certainly one of the concerns that we hear from investors around, you know, maintaining this level of profitability over the next couple of years, if to the extent that demand moderates at all. I was wondering if you have any comments around, you know, if there's any perhaps structural improvements that, you know or other changes to the business model, perhaps that make you a little more comfortable that this higher level of profitability in gross margins can be sustained over the next couple of years? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Mike, thanks for the question. You know, we haven't given any kind of a guide for forward, you know, periods beyond what we've done in 2021. You know, as your question about structural changes in the business, I think we have made some real structural businesses, structural changes in the way that we operate our business. We've talked a lot about those, and we talked a lot about them in this current, you know, in this current release.  You know, I would, you know, continue to reiterate and remind everybody that we are running a business that's focused on generating return. That's what we believe creates value for our shareholders. So while the gross margins are nice, and we're certainly enjoying a very rich margin right now, that's not the number one or the only thing that we focus on when we're managing land investment, when we're managing risk, when we're managing capital allocation in a way that allows us to not only grow our business, but to take that excess cash that's being generated by the business, and we're returning that to shareholders. And I think what you're getting out of that story, Mike is a, you know, a very attractive return on equity profile that, you know, we're proud of, and I think our shareholders are very happy to have. Operator : Our next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Truman Patterson : Ryan, Bob, Jim, thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. First, on active adult demand, clearly very robust, how sustainable do you think that is? You know, does it remain one of the better performers performing segments throughout 2021? And if so, you know, absorptions in the segment for you all, you know are clearly elevated, just given the 49% growth, just how repeatable is this performance? You know, your Del Webb when we think about the legacy communities, generally larger communities, you know, can you just run those a bit harder than your other communities? Just wanted to get your take there as to how sustainable that performance is? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Truman, it's a good question. One of the things that \u2013 and we just, we looked at, I looked at it yesterday that the traffic, foot traffic through the door of our doors of our Del Webb communities continues to be very strong through the first three weeks of April. So, you know, we're very pleased with that. We like the way that that brand is operating right now, you know, over the last kind of 5 years to 7 years, we've made some shifts in the way that we build those communities, the way that we monetize them, and the way that we create the lifestyle. And, you know, as I think most of you appreciate, the most important thing with our Del Webb brand is the lifestyle that we offer, the home is almost secondary. In this post COVID environment, I think what we're seeing is consumers really value the ability for outdoor lifestyle type activities and events that allow you to be connected with other people, but still maintain some level of, kind of social distance. And the web communities offer that and so, you know, we made reference to the fact that after a year of being kind of locked inside that fire group is ready to kind of get on with life and get on with retirement. And so, you know, we're happy with that. The other thing, you know, that I'd highlight Truman that's an important part of our story and our diversified consumer offering is, we've got a big move up business, and that move up business remains very strong. And so that, you know, typically what happens is that active adult buyer, when they're selling their home, it's going to a move up buyer, which allows them to go do a lot of things and gives them great flexibility moving into the Del Webb community. So, you know, the tight supply environment on the resale side of the business, I think is a very good forward indicator of how strong the Del Webb business continue to be. Truman Patterson : Okay. And then just on, you know, some of your larger, I'll just call them battleship Del Webb legacy communities, do those allow for higher absorption bases or are they kind of too small to necessarily move the needle [indiscernible]? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Truman so, you know, we\u2019ve got, we're down to about six, five or six of those really large battleship Del Webb communities. There's a good land pipeline in all of those communities, and we are seeing very high absorption rates out of those legacy communities. You know, we've said, for a long time that, you know, if the market came back in such a way we could let the volume in those communities run a little more wide open given the land runway, and we're certainly doing that right now. It's a smaller percentage of the overall business. So, you know, while it moves, the needle is not going to move the needle as much as maybe what it once would have. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Kim with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steven Kim : Yeah, thanks, guys. Exciting quarter, fun times. Couple of your competitors last week talked about conducting a stress test on their backlog and kind of concluded that mortgage rates could rise to like 4.2%. And they still wouldn't really see much of an impact to their backlog. I was wondering whether or not you had done a stress test like that. And then following up on Mike's question about peak margins, you know we've also been hearing a lot of people talking about peak margins. And, you know, I've been pushing back and I just love to have you weigh in on some of the things that more specifically that we pointed out to see whether you agree or disagree, we pointed out, you know, virtual tours and appointment scheduling drives reduce selling costs. You know, you have input cost inflation that is depressing your 2021 margins, actually, and so whenever that begins to moderate, you should get a benefit next year, you have lower interest costs, you know, it's accentuated by your recent debt pay down. And I would imagine you're probably also moving into some larger communities designed to run at a somewhat higher rate of absorptions. And so all of these things should theoretically be structural margin improvements, I was wondering if you agreed with that. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Alright. So to the first of your two questions. Steven, you know, did we do a stress test? I'm not sure what a stress test is on your backlog. We are always working with our backlog, though. You know, we actively manage them through the build cycle. And I would tell you that there are many things that can and might happen in a rising rate environment, and we would work with those consumers. You know, there are different products that can be offered. So yeah, I would agree that the strength of our backlog with 750 FICO scores, rising interest rates like that would not put our buyers in jeopardy. To your question on peak margins, you know there's so much that goes into that. What's the demand environment? What's the land environment? What type of product are we building? Having said that, I think your points are valid, whether they support higher margins or not structurally over time, I think they benefit the business. So, you mentioned virtual tours or selling costs. Yes, that's an enhancement interest. Certainly, we will get a benefit through time. You know, the $726 million that we paid down this quarter is $34 million in interest cost, which will ultimately come through as lower cost of sales. It'll take a little while because we capitalize it. So, there are a number of things that will benefit us through time. But they will be determinants of our margin, but so will the land cost, so will the vertical construction costs, and so will our selling prices. So to Ryan's earlier comment, you know, we underwrite against return, you guys have heard that from us a bunch. We obviously seek to maximize the margin that we are able to achieve. And we've got some tailwinds, but we've got some headwinds too in the form of lumber, etcetera. So, you know, Ryan said, it's a good time during the homebuilding business, it is. You know, we're enjoying very good margins. And we see them expanding through the year. So, I think that's a real positive. Steven Kim : Yeah, absolutely, it's encouraging. And thanks for the guidance out to 4Q that I think was really helpful. You have a business that you acquired a year ago, the ICG business, which operates a little more indoors, perhaps then, I guess you can call it indoors, a lot of air ventilation \u2013 was curious as to whether you could comment on the degree to which ICG has already begun to improve or aid your ability to ramp starts? Or perhaps, was that business a little bit more impacted by you know, COVID restrictions, you know, I know they're in Florida, so maybe not, but just wonder if you could provide a little bit more insight into how ICG is contributing? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. So Steven, we're very pleased with the ICG acquisition. We highlighted that, you know, on our Q1 or our Q4 call last quarter. You know, it highlights that the, you know, the business that we bought really only impacts our Jacksonville kind of North Florida business. And so, it's pretty small in terms of the overall impact of the company, but it has had a meaningful impact on our Jacksonville business. And so, we like kind of the fruits of what, you know, the fruits that we're getting off of that tree, I think are, you know, really good. And it's part of the reason that we're excited about, you know, getting close to announcing the location of the second plant. We've got, you know, we're down to, kind of a final couple of sites that will be the location for that. And you know, in short order, we'll be able to make a bigger announcement on that. And it's all part of, kind of the vision and the strategy that we had for ICG. And how do we see that playing out for our business over the next, you know, six to eight years, and we think there's a lot of benefits that will be generated for this company based on that platform. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Bouley : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the results. Ryan, you made a comment in your prepared remarks that the homebuilding industry can generate, I think you said higher returns at reduced risk. And if I take that in tandem with your other comment that pulled these option land position can move higher than 50%, just love to hear elaboration on both of those points, just why the industry is structurally improved? If it is simply the option market opening up or what else you meant by that and specifically for Pulte, you know, how to think about where your option mix can go? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Matt, good morning. I appreciate the comment. And really, you know, what we believe has happened, and so what we know has happened inside of our own company, and what we believe has happened inside of the industry is there is a better balance of risk that's being taken onto the company's balance sheet. And most notably, a more disciplined approach to capital allocation. If you go back a decade, 15 years in this industry, you know, it was very boom and bust all of the free cash flow in an upcycle was put into land. And then that land was harvested over the, you know, the following years. And sometimes you got caught in a cycle with the capital allocation philosophy that you're seeing from Pulte, and I think you're seeing elements of it from the entire industry. There's less owned land on the balance sheet, there's more options, there's more free cash being generated. Dividends are being paid, there is share repurchase programs in place, there's less debt. All of those things, I think warrant a, you know, a much different, kind of look from the investment community that I think how the industry has historically been viewed. Matthew Bouley : Got it? No, interesting. That is a helpful color. And then second one, I wanted to drill down into the cancellations actually. I know you set it down to 8%, which is a nice downtick, but you know, on an absolute basis, depending on how they're performing, it's still a big enough number to move the needle. My question is, in this market, are you finding that you're actually able to price higher on those canceled homes and perhaps realize a higher margin? And I imagine that that's a typical, but what if anything from that is contemplated in your gross margin guidance? Thank you. Bob O'Shaughnessy: You know, candidly that's not a big determinant in our forward guide, because there is very little of it. I mean, at 8% that is as low a cancellation rate and I can recall in 10 years in the business, you know, it's down sizably from last year, and even for those recent sequential quarter. And I think what it shows is the strength of the market, people who are under contract want to close because they know how hard it is to find something else to buy if they weren't to buy from us. But to your point, yes, if somebody fell out of contract, you know, halfway through the process with us, at least today, we would be able to sell it for more than we had sold it to them for, but that's not a big driver of our margin guide at all. Operator : Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please go ahead. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the general path of community count, due the balance of 2021 and maybe into 2022? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Carl. Good morning. Good to good to hear from you this morning. Certainly the increase in the business that we have guided to for 2021 has, you know, given us the opportunity to close out of some communities a little earlier than we expected. If you went back to the guide that we had previously given, we had indicated that our community count guide was going to be down in the 5% range. We'd update that today to suggest that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, this quarter this year versus the same quarter last year, our expectation is that we'll be down 5% to 10% for the balance of the year. So, for the second, third, and fourth quarter that would be our guide. We have not given any kind of indications on 2022 at this point. Carl Reichardt : All right, thanks. And then just on the active adult, and everyone is talking more about this, but the build times for active adult shorter or longer than the core product or if [is contract to close] shorter or longer? And then is part of the strength in the margin guide for the balance of the year, a mix shift in some meaningful way to higher margin active adults? Thanks. Bob O'Shaughnessy: No real difference in the cycle time. And in terms of the mix shift, you know, what we'll actually see is more of a mix shift and it's modest from move up to first time, an entry level. And so you know, active adult will be pretty consistent year-over-year and for the balance of this year. So, it's really that mix shift to the first time that's \u2026 Ryan Marshall : \u2026influencing the margin. Operator : Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Deepa Raghavan : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'll tag along on that community count commentary. So, you raised your closing units within your guide, but you're lowering your community can grow, suggesting, you know, community sizes have increased, did I read that right, and if so, are you able to comment on the size of your communities now and compare it to historical? What I'm also trying to determine is, how much of that increase in absorption pays, you witnessed in Q1 is kind of driven by a larger community versus sure sell-through? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, good morning. I think I understand most of the question. And you know, the makeup of our communities are largely the same over the last three or so years other than our big Del Webb communities. Our average community count size is about 130 lots. So, we don't have you know, other than a few of the legacy large Del Webb communities, we don't have, you know massive communities where you can really choose the absorption rate. And then, you know, in terms of community count, the only other part of the question that I would offer there is that, you know we have been very aggressive in the amount of incremental land spend that we're putting into the business, as we, you know, rebuild the land pipeline for 2022 and beyond. The only other thing that, you know is probably worth highlighting in terms of absorption paces is the mix shift of our business into entry level. And Bob highlighted on the prior question that we are seeing some of a shift from move up into entry level. And you'll recall, you know, going back three to four years, four years now, 4.5 years when I came into the chair as CEO, we talked about shifting some of our move up business into entry level. We've done that, and as you see that coming through on the closing side, those entry level communities typically come with higher per community absorption paces. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. That's helpful. My second follow up is on the state of pricing. Obviously, it's pretty strong now, but any thoughts going into next year? Obviously, do you expect to probably give back some of the price that you've gained from all the inflationary in pricing power that you're getting at this point in time. Just curious, you know, what are your expectations exiting the year, especially next year? And what are some of the drivers you'd point to as we try to assess how pricing is stronger or not to the rest of the year? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. We haven't given any guide on our expectations for pricing next year, you know, what I would share is that currently we're sitting at a guide of 6% to 8% on a year-over-year basis. We've, for the last three to four years prior to 2021, we were in the 1% to 2% year-over-year increase range. So, you know, we've seen unprecedented increases in cost. You know, my hope would be that, but that would start to temper. Certainly a big driver of this year's increases is lumber, and we're at kind of unprecedented highs for lumber. You know, our analysis suggest that there's plenty of raw material. The constraint really seems to be on the sawmills, and we are seeing some additional capacity start to come online. So, you know, if we can see, you know, some moderation in the lumber market. And the industry can kind of continue to run at pretty efficient levels that we're at today. My hope would be that, you know, we could see some pullback and overall cost increases next year, relative to where we've been sitting this year. Operator : Our next question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. John Lovallo : Hey, guys, thank you for fitting me in here. First question is, you know, lumber costs, as you mentioned have been very well telegraphed, and I think for structural panels as well. But you know, where else are you guys seeing inflation? We've heard [cement availability] and price has been \u2013 was becoming more of a problem. And I'm curious also, which you might be seeing on the labor front? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, well, [cement] very local, right, because the distribution ranges is pretty tight. And yes, where you've got markets where you've got activity, you're going to see pricing, and that's very consistent with what we typically see. You know, in terms of the labor market, you know, certainly it is a busy market out there. People have choices on where to work. Ryan mentioned earlier, the call, you know, we've obviously stepped up our production. You know, we've got good relationships with our trades, but it costs money to make people come to our job site today. And so that's built into that increase to the 6% to 8%. I wouldn't characterize it as hateful at the moment. You know, there is, you know, there is capacity out there. For some of the trades you have to pay to get them on the jobsite, though. But those are the, you know, as always, lumber and labor are going to be the two primary drivers of cost for us. John Lovallo : Got it. That's helpful. And then can you quantify the weather impact on the Texas \u2013 in Texas on closings? And was that the entirety of the [miss in the] quarter? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. [Mike], the miss that we had relative to our guide was largely driven by the weather in Texas. It was unlike any winter storm that Texas has seen and it shut that operation down for the better part of two weeks. And so, you know, our expectation is, we'll work to get the majority of that back in the second quarter, John, and, you know, we think other than that the, you know, the production machine, as I'd indicated in one of the earlier questions, is running quite well. And we'd like the rate of upstarts that we're seeing out of the business. Operator : Our final question comes from Alex Barron with Housing Research Center. Please go ahead. Alex Barron : Yeah, thanks, guys. And congratulations on the great job here. Hopefully, you could elaborate on the comment about active adults coming back, and it sounded like it was related to the vaccines, but, you know, just if you could elaborate on what you're hearing from the field, on that topic? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Alex, it's Ryan, thanks for the question. We're really excited about what we're seeing out of the active adult performance. You know, I think anecdotally we're saying that we're seeing that buyer, you know, reemerge in all aspects of their life because of their confidence around the vaccine. So, I think that's certainly a positive. I highlighted, you know, a few questions ago that the strength of the move up market is, we think also really helping that business because it's very easy for that active adult buyer to sell their home right now. They're selling it at very high prices. And so, I think that's given, you know, that buyer a lot of confidence and a lot of flexibility to go out and make the future investment that they want to make further for the retirement home and that's benefiting that Del Webb business for us. Alex Barron : Okay, great. And sorry if I missed it, but did you guys give, sort of a breakdown of, you know, price increase per segment, per buyer segment, which, you know, I'd like to know which ones are doing \u2013 which one is doing the best right now? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, we did that, but we can. So, first time entry level was up 2%, year-over-year, move up was up. 4%, we had mentioned in the prepared remarks, active adult was up 6%. You know, it's interesting, because, you know, there's a lot of movement under the hood on that, right, you know, in terms of geographic closings. So, mix matters. You know, what I would tell you is, the pricing environment is pretty strong. And, yeah, so, you know, underneath that, you know, where the closings came from the size of the product is important. So, but the headline numbers are two, four, and six for entry level move up and active adult. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Zeumer for any closing remarks. James Zeumer : Great, thank you, Sarah. Appreciate everybody's time this morning. We will certainly be available over the course of day for any other questions, and we look forward to talking to you on our next earnings call. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. At that time, in order to ask a question, you may press star and then one. To withdraw your question, you may press star and two. Please also note today\u2019s event is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference call over to Jim Zeumer. Sir, please go ahead. Jim Zeumer : Great, thank you Jamie, and good morning. I appreciate everyone joining today\u2019s call to review PulteGroup\u2019s operating and financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021.  Joining me today to discuss PulteGroup\u2019s strong second quarter are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO, Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO, and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of this morning\u2019s earnings release and the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of the call later today. Let me note that in addition to reviewing our reported Q2 results, we will also be reviewing adjusted results which exclude a $46 million pre-tax insurance benefit and a tax benefit of $12 million resulting from a change in valuation allowances associated with state net operating loss carry forwards. A reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financials is included in this morning\u2019s release and within today\u2019s webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance.  As always, I want to alert everyone that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Jim. Good morning. On today\u2019s call, we will be covering PulteGroup\u2019s financial results as well as updating you on several important initiatives we continue to advance. As Bob will detail in a few minutes, PulteGroup delivered another quarter of strong financial results.  Looking at the business, along with a 28% increase in net new orders, we generated significant top line revenue growth, outstanding gross and operating margins, and a 50% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Clearly there is a lot to be excited about in our results.  Clearly financial results are important, but I believe that running a successful homebuilding business means thinking about the long term and focusing on the key drivers that we believe create shareholder value. These include attracting and retaining a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide a world-class buying experience for our customers, following a disciplined capital allocation strategy, running an efficient homebuilding operation, and realizing higher returns and intelligently manning risks through time. I\u2019m proud to say that consistently executing against these key drivers has been critical to the quality of the operating results we have realized and the outstanding financial position we had established. Consistent with our constructive view of the housing market, we previously announced our intention to increase land investment in 2021. In fact, through the first six months of this year, we\u2019ve invested $1.8 billion in land acquisition and development. This is up from $1.1 billion last year and $1.5 billion in 2019, with the latter number including the acquisition of the American West assets. Given our increasing land spend, I want to emphasize that we continue to make these investments using the same disciplined approach and underwriting practices against which we have operated for most of the past decade. In overlay to our investment process, we also continue to execute against our strategy of controlling more land via option. I\u2019m happy to report that 53% of our land was optioned at quarter end, which is approaching all-time highs, and we will of course seek to raise this percentage as market conditions permit. Although on a smaller scale compared with land, I would highlight that we continue to invest in our offsite manufacturing strategy. I\u2019m pleased to report that we recently leased a facility in Florence, South Carolina that will expand our offsite manufacturing capabilities. We expect to begin delivering product from this facility to parts of our southeastern operation in the first half of 2022. The Florence facility is our second offsite manufacturing plant and follows our earlier acquisition of ICG at the beginning of 2020. These two plants are part of our long-term strategy to address labor and related production challenges that we expect will continue impacting the future of homebuilding.  As part of our disciplined capital allocation policies, we are also continuing to return capital to shareholders. Through the first six months of this year, we have returned just shy of $430 million through share repurchases and dividends. You will recall our Q1 announcement of a $1 billion increase to our repurchase authorization. You can see that we are already putting this authorization to use. Having capital available to allocate comes from strong cash flows being generated from well run operations. Bob will provide the details, but I would like to highlight that our reported operating margins in the second quarter exceeded 18% with adjusted operating margins approaching 17%. With an industry that historically achieved operating margins of approximately 10%, our performance over the last several years is clearly breaking with this old paradigm. More broadly, I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge that our entire industry is working to raise this performance bar. Finally, we believe creating long term value for our shareholders comes from generating high returns over the housing cycle. For the trailing 12 months, PulteGroup has delivered an outstanding return of 25.7% on our equity. Driving higher returns is something we\u2019ve been talking about for the past decade, so we are proud to be delivering on that objective. The returns we generate are an outcome that reflects the myriad of day-to-day decisions we make as we allocate capital and run our business. As I noted, we are making these decisions today based up on a favorable long term view of the U.S. housing market, although we appreciate recent questions about near-term conditions. As a general statement, I will tell you that housing demand was strong in the second quarter and that these trends have continued into the first few weeks of July. From Google website searches to community visits, we continue to see a very high level of consumer interest in buying new homes. Given the unusual demand dynamics created by the pandemic, we are careful when comparing 2021 to 2020, so we also look back to prior years for additional perspective. To that end, we monitor an array of traffic, conversion and sign-up trends and our local operations provide insights on what is happening on the ground in their respective markets. Based on all the metrics we monitor and consistent with our business performance, we would say that the second quarter demand in the overwhelming majority of our markets was as strong or stronger than the first 90 days of this year. I would also tell you that buyer interest in the period was stronger than the second quarter of 2019, in other words, prior to the pandemic. Buyer demand has been strong but customer feedback also hints at a sense of frustration with the lack of homes available for purchase and the rate of price appreciation they\u2019ve seen in the market.  With this as a backdrop, I would also tell you that we purposely restricted sales through lot releases or similar actions in roughly 75% of our communities across the country. These actions were taken to better align our sales efforts with our current production capacity and to begin rebuilding spec homes closer to our historic level of 25%. Said simply, we likely could have sold a lot more homes in the quarter above the 28% increase in net new orders and 40% increase in absorption pace that we reported. When we thread all these data points together, we continue to see a strong demand environment with a very high level of interest in buying a new home. As has been the case for multiple years, the ongoing strength in demand reflects powerful macro forces, including favorable demographics, an under-supply of new and resale homes, an improving economy and a supportive interest rate environment. While meaningful constraints on home availability and price increases are likely influencing short term conditions, we remain very optimistic about the long term demand trends. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our second quarter results. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks Ryan, and good morning. I\u2019m pleased to have the opportunity to review PulteGroup\u2019s second quarter results, which show our ongoing gains in key operating and financial metrics.  Starting with the income statement, wholesale revenues for the second quarter increased 31% over the comparable prior year period to $3.2 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 22% increase in closings to 7,232 homes, along with a 7% increase in average sales price to $447,000. While our second quarter deliveries showed nice gains over last year, they did come in below our prior guidance due directly to an incremental increase of roughly two weeks in our build cycle times in the majority of our markets. The increase in build cycle times primarily reflects ongoing disruptions in the supply chain. Consistent with comments made on recent calls, the 7% or $31,000 increase in average sales price in the second quarter reflects price increases realized in all markets and across all buyer groups. Our mix of deliveries in the quarter included 32% from first-time buyers, 41% from move-up buyers, and 27% from active adult buyers, which compares to 31% first-time buyers, 44% move-up buyers, and 25% active adult buyers in the second quarter of last year. The company\u2019s net new orders for the second quarter totaled 8,322 homes, which is an increase of 28% over the second quarter of last year. In the quarter, we saw continuations of the trends we reported in the first quarter of this year, which included strong demand across all geographies and buyer groups with clear outperformance among our active adult home buyers. In the quarter, first-time orders increased 12% to 2,637 homes, move-up orders increased 15% to 3,273 homes, and active adult orders increased 81% to 2,412 homes. It\u2019s worth noting that the significant year-over-year increase in active adult orders reflects a dramatic pandemic-induced slowdown in 2020, but I would also highlight that the absolute order rate for these buyers is actually near 15-year highs. Beyond any impact the pandemic has had on our year-over-year comparisons, I refer back to Ryan\u2019s comments that our divisions were actively restricting sales in upwards of three quarters of our available communities during the second quarter. By design, these limitations had the most significant impact in our first-time and move-up communities.  During the quarter, we operated from an average of 808 communities, which is a decrease of 9% from an average of 887 communities last year and is consistent with our previous guidance. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 8%, which is down significantly from last year and consistent with the first quarter of this year. Benefiting from our strong Q2 orders, our year-over-year backlog increased by 52% to 20,056 homes. Given the strong pricing environment, the value of our backlog increased an even greater 70% to $9.8 billion.  Consistent with comments made during our first quarter earnings call, we started construction on 9,800 homes in the period. This is more than double what we started in Q2 of last year and represents a sequential increase of 17% over the number of homes started in the first quarter. As a result of the increase in our starts, we ended the second quarter with 17,344 homes under construction, which represents an increase of 58% compared to last year. Of the homes under construction, 2,233 or 13% were spec units. This percentage is up slightly from the first quarter but remains below our longer term target of 25%. Based on the fact that many of our units under construction are still early in the build cycle coupled with existing supply chain challenges, we expect deliveries in the third quarter to be in the range of 7,300 to 7,600 homes. These same forces will also impact our total deliveries for the full year. At this time, we expect full year closings of 30,500 homes, which would be an increase of 24% over full year 2020 results. As has been well reported, favorable supply-demand dynamics have supported price increases in new and existing homes across the country. Positive conditions can be seen in our average price in our backlog, which is higher by 12% over Q2 of last year to $491,000. Given higher backlog prices and the anticipated mix of home deliveries going forward, we expect our average closing price in the third quarter to be between $470,000 and $475,000. For the second quarter, we reported a home building gross margin of 26.6% compared with 23.9% last year. The 270 basis point increase, which exceeded our guidance, reflects the exceptional pricing environment we have been experiencing for a number of quarters as well as the mix of homes closed in the period. Beyond the 7% increase in the average price of homes closed, discounts in the period fell to 1.9%. This is down from 3.5% last year and represents a sequential decrease of 60 basis points from the first quarter of this year. Our second quarter margins also reflect a legal settlement of $5 million, which benefited gross margin by approximately 20 basis points. As reflected in the increases in our sales prices and gross margin, we have been able to pass on the meaningful cost inflation we have incurred over the course of the year. At this point, we now expect house costs to be up between 9% and 11% for the full year with the peak of certain costs, driven by lumber, flowing through in the third and fourth quarters. Even with the ongoing rise in build costs, we still see opportunity for gross margins to move higher over the remaining two quarters of the year. As a result, we expect our third quarter gross margins to be 26.8% with our fourth quarter gross margin expected to be 27.3%. Our reported SG&A expense for the second quarter was $272 million or 8.4% of home sale revenues, which includes a $46 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in the period. Excluding this benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $319 million or 9.8% of home sale revenues. For the second quarter of last year, our reported SG&A expense was $197 million or 8% of home sale revenues, and excluding the impact of a $61 million pre-tax insurance benefit and $10 million of pre-tax charges from actions taken in response to the pandemic, adjusted SG&A was $247 million or 10% of home sale revenues. Based on projected closings over the remainder of the year, we expect SG&A expense in the third quarter to be in the range of 9% to 9.5% of home sale revenues and now expect our full year adjusted SG&A to be 9.6% of home sale revenues, which represents a 20 basis point improvement compared to our previous guidance for the year. For the second quarter, our financial services operation reported pre-tax income of $51 million compared with $60 million last year. The decrease in profitability relative to recent quarters reflects the increasingly competitive market conditions that developed during the first half of the year.  In the second quarter, our reported tax expense was $136 million, representing an effective tax rate of 21.3%. In the quarter, we realized a tax benefit of $12 million resulting from a change in valuation allowance associated with projected utilization of certain state net operating loss carry forwards.  Our reported net income for the second quarter was $503 million or $1.90 per share, and our adjusted net income for the period was $456 million or $1.72 per share. The company\u2019s reported net income in last year\u2019s second quarter was $349 million or $1.29 per share, and our adjusted net income was $311 million or $1.15 per share. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash and a debt to capital ratio of 22.7%, which is down from 23.3% at the end of Q1 and 32.1% a year ago. Given our large cash position, our net debt to capital ratio at the end of June was 4.5%. As a reminder, our board of directors authorized a billion dollar increase to our share repurchase plan in April of this year. In the second quarter, we used $200 million of our authorization to repurchase 3.6 million shares, which represents a 1.4% reduction in our outstanding shares at an average price of $55.84 per share. In the second quarter, we also invested $986 million in land acquisition and development, bringing our year-to-date spend to $1.8 billion. As we remain constructive on the opportunities for long term housing demand, we continue to invest in our business through the same disciplined processes we\u2019ve used to build our existing land pipeline. Given our positive stance on the market, we are targeting full year investment this year of approximately $4 billion in land acquisition and development, which represents an 8% increase over our prior guidance. Inclusive of the investments made in the second quarter, we ended the period with approximately 207,000 lots owned and controlled. Of these lots, 53% are controlled through options, which is approaching all-time highs for the company. While the owned-option split can shift a little from quarter to quarter, we continue to make steady progress against our strategy to increase land option to enhance returns and/or reduce market-related risks. I would highlight that our percentage of lots controlled via option has increased from 31% at the end of 2016 and we will continue to seek optionality in an increasing percentage of our controlled lots.  Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the business during the quarter and believe that we are extremely well positioned heading into the second half of the year. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Ryan Marshall : Before we open the call to questions, I want to briefly touch on an exciting relationship that we just announced with Invitation Homes.  As most of you know, we have been evaluating different ways for PulteGroup to get involved in the rapidly expanding long-term single family rental business. We were looking for an approach that leveraged our expertise in land acquisition and home construction with an acceptable level of risk and that generated sufficient margins and returns. I believe that we have accomplished this through our collaboration with Invitation Homes, the leader in single family rental. As outlined in the release, beginning in 2022, PulteGroup expects to design and build approximately 7,500 new homes over a five-year period for sale to Invitation Homes for inclusion in their single family rental leasing portfolio. We have already agreed to projects in the state of Florida, Georgia, California and Texas, representing an initial 1,000 homes. Under the program structure, we are effectively a preferred provider of new construction homes to Invitation.  Along with providing a strong margin and return opportunity, this relationship offers a number of other benefits. The increased construction volume allows us to further expand local market scale within the areas we currently serve. The increased inventory turn resulting from these sales can enhance overall project returns. The increased volume could allow the company to potentially pursue larger land pieces in select locations, and the relationship could also support PulteGroup\u2019s entry into select new markets we have been assessing.  We have been diligent in our efforts to find the right entry point into single family rentals and we are excited about this opportunity and the chance to work with an industry leader like Invitation Homes. Before turning this back to Jim, let me thank all of our employees for their work in delivering these exceptional financial results and, more importantly, an outstanding home buying experience for our customers. I also want to applaud our entire organization on PulteGroup being ranked among the 2021 Best Workplaces for Millennials by Fortune and Great Place to Work. Following our being named to the prestigious Fortune 100 Best Companies for Work For earlier this year, this newest ranking further builds our position as an employer of choice for all generations. As the CEO of PulteGroup, I appreciate what you do every day for our customers and for each other.  Now let me turn the call back to Jim. Jim Zeumer : Great, thanks Ryan. We are now prepared to open the call to questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time on this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you, and I\u2019ll now ask Jamie to explain the process and open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Mike Dahl from RBC. Please go ahead with your question. Mike Dahl : Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Ryan, really helpful commentary just now. I wanted to start with your comment about how demand feels at least as strong in the majority of your markets over the course of 2Q as 1Q, and just as you go across maybe from a buyer segmentation standpoint, to what extent, if any, have you started to see the demand pool get a little bit thinned out by affordability as you\u2019ve continue to push price fairly aggressively? Ryan Marshall : Yes Mike, thanks for the question. As we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we really haven\u2019t. To your point, we have raised prices quite aggressively. We\u2019ve effectively limited sales through restricting lot releases and other processes we used in over 75% of our communities, so we just have not seen demand wane throughout the quarter. As I characterized it in my prepared remarks, we think demand was at least equal to what we saw in Q1 and in some communities and some locales, even better. Mike Dahl : Okay, thanks. Just to follow up on that as my second question, to your point, you\u2019ve got multiple prongs in terms of the ways that you\u2019ve kind of restricted and managed sales, one being phased lot releases, but I think you\u2019ve also employed, I believe you term it the easy offer process, so basically accepting bids on the lots once they\u2019re released. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more on to what extent you\u2019ve employed that practice, is that across all those 75% of the communities that you\u2019re restricting, and any additional details you can give us on how that has trended as one of your--one of the tools and whether that\u2019s being used more or less now versus a couple months ago. Ryan Marshall : Yes Mike, it is one of the tools that we use. We find that for certain buyer groups in certain communities, it works well, Mike. I\u2019d tell you that we don\u2019t use it in every division in every community, so it\u2019s one of the tools, and to give you an exact number of how many times we used that versus other mechanisms, I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve got that information at my fingertips, but a pretty high number of our divisions do use it. Operator : Our next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead with your question. Alan Ratner : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and for all of the detail and commentary so far. Ryan, I\u2019d love to first touch on the supply-demand environment right now. I think you mentioned 75% of communities limiting sales, which I think is pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve heard from a lot of other builders. I\u2019m curious where you see that going over the next several months - on one hand, it looks like your start pace improved quite a bit, which is great; on the other hand, it seems like cycle times continue to get extended. You trimmed the closing guide for the full year a little bit, so it feels like a lot of those challenges, if anything, are not getting better, maybe getting worse a little bit. Is there an opportunity to kind of pull back on some of those limitations, or do you actually maybe anticipate them accelerating or getting more aggressive here over the next few months to allow the supply chain to catch its breath a little bit? Ryan Marshall : Yes Alan, good morning. Thanks for the questions. As I think Bob highlighted in some of his commentary, we\u2019d characterize the supply chain as about the same. There are different challenges that are popping up - one gets solved and then you\u2019ve got another one to deal with. It certainly has elongated our cycle time, and that\u2019s what\u2019s contributed to us adjusting our full year closing guide for the total year. With what we see today, we\u2019re not anticipating it getting any worse than what we\u2019re currently experiencing, and our hope would be as the world continues to reopen, more and more folks are vaccinated, more employers are going back to work in full capacity, that some of those supply chain related challenges would get solved or would maybe get slightly improved. That\u2019s what I would share with you on the supply side. As far as demand goes, Alan, time will tell. I would continue to reiterate what we experienced in the quarter and well into the third week of July - demand is strong, and we continue to be impressed with the appetite of the consumer and the buyer for homes in general, but specifically new homes. Keep in mind, I think all of this is being done against the backdrop of summer time, maybe the first kind of normal or semi-normal summer that we\u2019ve had in the better part of two years, so suffice to say I think there\u2019s been other distractions out there that potentially capture the attention of the consumer, and we haven\u2019t seen it have an impact on demand at this point. Alan Ratner : That\u2019s great to hear and very helpful. Second, I\u2019d love to spend a second or two hearing a bit more about the partnership with Invitation Homes, and what I\u2019m curious about from your perspective is 7,500 homes over five years, should we think about that as being additive to your for-sale business, or is some of that going to maybe come out of the for-sale business, recognizing it\u2019s competing for the same land, the same labor, the same materials, and it doesn\u2019t seem like those constraints are getting better anytime soon. Is the capacity there to fully make this a one plus one equals two, or should we think about this as maybe a little bit more of a hedge and maybe the business grows a bit, but not fully at that 1,500 home per year level? Ryan Marshall : Yes Alan, it\u2019s a fair question, and I\u2019m going to give you a little bit of a, it\u2019s a bit of both, answer. We do believe that a fair number of these homes will truly be incremental to our existing for-sale business, and that would certainly be the intent. We think that this partnership will give us access to larger land parcels and allow us to build everything that we normally would have built for sale, and then incrementally do some rental units as well. Certainly I think there will be some projects where it becomes a little fungible and some of the units will come out of what historically would have been our for-sale portfolio. We\u2019ll see how the partnership plays out and what opportunities are there, but we do believe that this will become part of our growth story and we\u2019re excited about that. I\u2019d highlight, Alan as I think you know, the price points of the homes that are typically going to the rental pools are slightly smaller, more on the entry level price point, the cycle times are a little faster, the construction\u2019s a little easier, so we certainly think that aspect will help on the construction side of things. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zener from Keybanc. Please go ahead with your questions. Ken Zener : Good morning everybody. Ryan Marshall : Hi Ken. Ken Zener : Obviously we\u2019ve had new home sales yesterday - I think it slowed sequentially and there\u2019s been some downward revisions on the government data, but you\u2019re still doing about 3.4 orders this last quarter, a bit down but above your 2.5-plus range in the past. The question is, can you talk to how the higher pace is changing the industry, the norms for you guys perhaps, and specific to that, how we should think about how you\u2019re thinking, how you\u2019re buying your land when you run your models relative to communities rising, relative to the order pace as we see it today, because you\u2019re talking about larger communities which obviously could have higher pace, but I\u2019m just trying to understand how you\u2019re thinking is evolving, even how the industry is shifting, because there obviously was that pivot away from higher communities given last cycle\u2019s experience. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes Ken, it\u2019s a fair question. I think, and this is going to perhaps be a boring answer, we haven\u2019t changed our thought process in terms of how we\u2019re seeking to access the land market, and more importantly what our return expectations are. Now, obviously when we look at potential transactions, the current market influences our thinking, but as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re mindful that the market is moving at a pretty fast pace today, and so we always think what happens if it goes back to what had been the norm before that, what does it do to our return expectations. On balance, our community sizes have gotten a little bit bigger but not much, honestly - they\u2019re still three years on average, our return screen is the same.  One of the nice things, and Ryan highlighted it about the relationship with Invitation Homes, is because they are going to have a need for and a desire for delivery of certain cadence of homes, coupled with the homes that we\u2019re going to build for sale, it allows for an accelerated build and delivery rate that is return enhancing, so it actually lets us look at different communities. Maybe a little bit further on the question that Ryan got asked a minute ago, it allows us to think about different land parcels, so it might be something that we would have passed on but for the relationship with Invitation Homes. All those things factor in, and so when our teams are out looking, stuff that they used to say no to, we now have a different kind of build and sell model that we can layer it into that might broaden the universe of assets that we\u2019re looking at.  Again to be clear about this, our return expectations haven\u2019t changed, and whether it\u2019s looking at things that we\u2019re going to build solely for sale or include a rental portion, we have the same return expectations around that. Ryan Marshall : Yes, and Ken, I\u2019d also add and just kind of emphasize, I think Bob touched on it, we haven\u2019t changed our philosophy in terms of the number of years of land that we want to own. We\u2019ve also, as we highlighted in this most recent quarter, we\u2019ve gotten our land under option up to the highest that its arguably been in the last decade at 53% of our lots are controlled via option, so I think we\u2019re sticking to the fundamentals and the principles that we laid out, that we believe, to the point that Bob made, really manage risk and drive the best returns that we can get. Ken Zener : Right, right. I appreciate that.  Bob, just during your answer, I thought of a question which I didn\u2019t think of, related to the Invitation Homes. I think your business is running very steadily, obviously, but when you look at these parcels of land, is there--I\u2019m just thinking about joint ventures or any obligations, if the world changes, are you guys--is there some type of guarantee in terms of them purchasing if you\u2019re buying the land, or is the land for these lots held differently? Thank you very much. Ryan Marshall : Yes Ken, we do not have a joint venture. As Bob and I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we have an arrangement with Invitation Homes that is on a--that\u2019s struck on a project-by-project basis, so we underwrite every project individually, as do they. We have purchase and sale agreements that are, while bigger in size, pretty normal with what we typically do in purchase and sale type agreements. We think in terms of the risk on our side, risk on their side, we think we\u2019ve effectively managed that and we\u2019re doing it in a pretty responsible way. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions. Matthew Bouley : Good morning, thank you for taking the questions. Just back on the sale restrictions in, it sounded like, three-quarters of your communities, I\u2019m just curious if you could outline a little bit around what you\u2019re looking for to loosen those restrictions, if there\u2019s any targets you may have, something like specs per community or just knocking cycle time back down. Obviously it\u2019s going to be different everywhere, but just looking for any kind of guideposts on how to think about that. Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes Matt, thanks for the question. You highlighted a number of them. The other one that I would add to that is the number of months that a customer will be in backlog while their home is constructed, so we ideally like to target something in the six to seven month range. We occasionally will go outside of that, but we find you go much longer than seven months, it starts to have a negative impact on the customer experience, so we will look at that as well. We also look at overall cycle time, which we\u2019ve highlighted is slightly getting expanded, and then our lot availability and our lot development times, kind of what the runway is in front of us, we evaluate that. Then you\u2019d add into that obviously production capabilities, trade availability, so do we have the opportunity to bring on more trades. In some of our entry level communities, Matt, I would highlight that we\u2019re building more specs in those communities, and so in those communities we actually don\u2019t want to sell the home until it reaches a later stage of production, and so in those communities, we\u2019re trying to catch up. We are certainly still selling and we\u2019re open--it\u2019s mostly in our Texas communities, we\u2019re open and we\u2019re selling but we\u2019re intentionally really holding back as we put more homes into the spec pipeline. Matthew Bouley : Great, really helpful color there. Thanks for that, Ryan. My follow-up, I wanted to ask about pricing power actually on the first-time buyer portfolio relative to, I guess, move-up and active adult communities. Obviously your first-time is not entirely the lowest end entry level, but I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing that first-time buyer perhaps getting stretched at all relative to those buyers that are selling an existing home and realizing the equity in that. Thank you. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, it\u2019s a fair question. Interestingly, the average sales price for our first-time buyers is $338,000 in the most recent quarter - that\u2019s up 6% over the prior year. That\u2019s against the combined portfolio up 7%, and just for perspective, our move-up was up about 9%, our active adult was up about 8%, so it\u2019s all. In the prepared remarks, we highlighted this - it\u2019s kind of all markets, all buyers that pricing is pretty consistent. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Stephen Kim : Yes, thanks a lot, guys. You put out a pretty aggressive start outlook last quarter for this quarter, and you pretty much hit - 9,800 starts, I think you said is what you did in 2Q. I was curious as to whether this is a level of start activity that you intend to sustain or perhaps even increase over the next several quarters, if you could give us some visibility on that because obviously that\u2019s a level of starts which is running considerably higher than your closings, and it seems like you\u2019ve indicated that the lengthening of the cycle time has started to level out, basically, that you\u2019re not seeing cycle times meaningfully increase still as we\u2019re in the third quarter here. I just wanted to clarify what your outlook is for starts. Ryan Marshall : Yes Stephen, thanks for the question. We did have a really good start quarter, and our field production and construction teams, I think did an amazing job getting the 9,800 homes in the ground in the quarter. We\u2019d highlighted last quarter, and I\u2019d highlight it again today, that\u2019s not a rate that we would intend to run at through the balance of the year. The Q2 number was really meant to get some of our outsized backlog into the production pipeline, as well as to rebuild our spec inventory. We think we\u2019ve made meaningful progress against that. Our Q3 and our Q4 start rate will certainly be up over prior year, although we probably expect it to be below the 9,800 that we did in Q2. As we think about production capacity, we think we\u2019ve got a lot of inherent ability and inherent capacity built into our system, and certainly as we look to grow the company, we look to grow in the future years, we\u2019ll evaluate what that spec or that ultimate start rate should ultimately be over several cycles. Stephen Kim : Got it, thanks very much for that. Then your gross margin was pretty strong, and you\u2019ve given some guidance that you\u2019re going to have peak lumber costs, basically, running through in 3Q and 4Q. I\u2019m curious as to whether--you\u2019ve helped us understand what the year-over-year headwind from lumber you\u2019re expecting to be embedded within your 3Q and 4Q guidance, and in terms of basis points, is it a year-over-year headwind of, whatever, a couple hundred basis points, that kind of thing? Then secondarily, if 3Q and 4Q is peak lumber, is it fair to think that given what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the lumber prices recently, that 2022, the beginning of \u201922 margins should benefit, kind of like the reverse of the headwind from higher lumber in 3Q and 4Q maybe getting the benefit in first half of 2022? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes Stephen, fair question. We\u2019re not going to give a guide on margins for next year. Fair to say that if lumber prices stay where they are, it will be a tailwind. In terms of absolute impact on our margin, I think we had highlighted this in the most recent call, historically we would have thought the lumber pack ex-labor would have been 3% to 5% of the ASP. We had highlighted that had run up to probably 6% to 8%, so in real dollar terms on a $440,000 ASP, $25,000 to $30,000 in lumber cost in a house, so you can kind of think through if pricing falls, and depending on where you think lumber goes, random lags OSD falling at different rates, the benefit will be--you know, if we can get back to that 3% to 5% of ASP, pretty sizeable. Where pricing is, what lumber does, how that happens, again we\u2019ve seen different rates of change for different components, but if things go as it appears they\u2019re looking, it\u2019ll be a little bit of a benefit in fiscal \u201922. Stephen Kim : For sure, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. First, just wanted to touch on the offsite manufacturing facility you\u2019re expanding to a second location. I know historically you haven\u2019t necessarily given any quantitative measures on margin performance or anything like that. I was just hoping you could give us an update, either any quantitative on the margin side or just qualitatively what you\u2019re seeing - better cycle times, lower warranty costs, and any update or metrics you can put around that would be helpful. Ryan Marshall : Hey Truman, it\u2019s Ryan - good morning. We\u2019re really excited about the second location for our ICG operation. To your point, we have not provided margin guidance at this point. Even with this second facility, we think the amount of our business that it\u2019s impacting is still pretty small. As we continue to scale, we get to a third plant, a fourth plant, and it\u2019s starting to impact a bigger part of our business, I think that that insight will become more relevant and certainly more appropriate. Qualitatively, I think the thing that I would expound and elaborate on, we\u2019re really happy with what it\u2019s doing for our operation. In terms of the quality of the product that\u2019s coming out of the facilities, it is top notch. We\u2019ve got a really talented team of designers and operators that are running that plant. The constructability of those components that are happening in the field are really exceeding our expectations, and it\u2019s serving saving a significant cycle time on the frame shell components of the homes, depending on how many of the components are actually going in. Talented group of folks that are running the ICG operation for us. We\u2019re going to continue to grow it from here, and our hope would be in the coming six to nine months, we can have some type of an investor day or some type of an event where we can show you all firsthand what this factory does for us. Truman Patterson : Okay, thanks for that. You know, Ryan, when I think about--you know, you all are accelerating your land investment quite a bit this year, and that\u2019s going to impact how your company looks a couple years out. When I think back over the past handful of years, you seem like you\u2019ve been a little bit more flexible as to which end markets you\u2019re willing to go in, just purely based off of returns, whatever drives the highest return.  With that in mind, are there any areas, recognizing how large of an investment you\u2019re making this year, entry level, move-up, active adult, is it in line with where you\u2019ve been historically, or are there any product categories that you\u2019re rotating towards, geographies, anything along those lines to help us out? Ryan Marshall : In terms of consumer groups, Truman, very consistent with where we\u2019ve been targeting historically. As a refresher, 35% of the business first-time entry level, 40% of the business with our Pulte branded move-up family communities, and 25% in active adult, so really no change to that focus. In terms of markets, not a whole lot of change there either, other than we have highlighted that we\u2019ve recently re-entered Denver. We are in the triad area of North Carolina, and we\u2019ve started to kind of expand into some of the markets like Columbia and Greenville as well, leveraging some of our existing operations. You\u2019re starting to see a little bit of incremental land spend in a few of those places, but other than that, it\u2019s largely consistent with our current footprint. Truman Patterson : All right, thanks for taking my questions, and good luck on the upcoming quarter. Ryan Marshall : Thanks Truman. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Rehaut : Thanks, good morning everyone. First question I had was on the active adult business - obviously a really strong result from an order growth standpoint, and actually looking at it on a two-year stack, if I\u2019m doing the math right, it looks like orders were up 40% versus 2019 second quarter, versus first-time up 30%. The question is, obviously you\u2019ve had the first-time buyer really strong more broadly speaking over the last two, three years, I think that by and large continues to today, but the active adult obviously has historically allowed for great customer diversification. At the same time, you\u2019ve had somewhat of a longer land position for that business, and over time you\u2019ve shifted from kind of the bigger battleships to the more nimble positions, maybe 500,000 lot type communities. Just curious how you see the business over the next two or three years. Is this stronger growth rate that I referred to allowing you guys to maybe cycle through land a little bit more quickly and allow that business to even result in an overall consolidated Pulte continuing to shift more towards that lot optioning and improve your overall financial profile? Ryan Marshall : Yes Mike, we\u2019re excited about what the Del Webb brand is doing for the company, and specifically the recent performance. We had a great quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the absorptions were up 76%. Now admittedly, that\u2019s against a pretty soft quarter last year when that consumer wasn\u2019t traveling, but on an absolute new order basis, we reached levels that we haven\u2019t seen in a long, long time. We like the way the brand\u2019s performing, we think we\u2019ve got some great assets. Our newer vintage Del Webb communities are even better located than what historical ones were, and some of those historical battleships, given that we\u2019ve had them for a long time, they\u2019re in pretty damn good locations as well, just as time has allowed them to mature and they\u2019ve become closer in. The other advantage that we have with some of those legacy communities is we do have land there. We\u2019re able to develop that land and run those communities at a little faster rate in the current environment, which is certainly helping with return and overall inventory turn. In terms of what the brand does for us over the next two to three years, as we\u2019ve highlighted in some of our comments, we\u2019re very constructive on the overall U.S. housing market. We believe with that market staying healthy, that will bode well for this active adult consumer as well as they\u2019re typically selling their resale home and looking to move and do other things. We\u2019re certainly bullish on the entire business, but I think maybe extra positive on the active adult component. Michael Rehaut : Okay, that\u2019s helpful, appreciate it. Second question, perhaps just to think about sales pace in the back half of the year, you mentioned that you would expect 3Q, 4Q starts pace to be below the rate you did in the second quarter. Historically in the back half of the year, sales pace has moderated roughly 10% sequentially in the third quarter, another 15% off of that in the fourth quarter. At the same, obviously, you\u2019ve talked about the fact that demand well exceeds your ability to--well exceeds supply as you\u2019re limiting lot releases, etc. How should we think about sales pace in the back half with all that considered? Is a reversion towards that historical sequential decline, roughly speaking, how we should be thinking about things, or should we be considering a different dynamic given the strong, continued strong demand backdrop that you\u2019ve described? Ryan Marshall : Yes Mike, we\u2019re not going to give any guidance on order rates for Q3 or Q4, but I would tell you that given the current environment and how strong demand is, and the fact that we are intentionally and purposefully restricting sales, I think it\u2019s difficult to use historical models to predict the next couple of quarters. We like the way we\u2019re operating, we are very optimistic and bullish on consumer demand. We\u2019re going to continue to sell as many as we think we can produce and our land pipeline will--our developed land pipeline will allow for, but at this point that\u2019s probably all I can give you in terms of future order growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Susan Maklari : Thank you, good morning everyone. My first question is around the SG&A - you know, you\u2019ve obviously done a good job of leveraging that, and the guidance is lower than where we were coming into the year. Can you talk about the key drivers of that and how we should be thinking about it going forward as you continue to expand the business? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, hey Susan, it\u2019s Bob. I think very consistently, we\u2019ve answered this question over time. As the business grows, we certainly expect that we will get leverage from that, and I think if you go back probably five years and look, with the exception of sort of the pothole that got created because of the basic elimination of spend during the pandemic, you\u2019ve seen a very consistent inverse trend - as our revenues have increased, our SG&A as a percentage of those revenues has decreased in relative step order to the size. I think we\u2019ve done a very nice job through time of managing against our expense--our expenses against our revenue stream. I think it\u2019s a pretty good blueprint for what you can and should expect from us going forward. We\u2019ve said it before - we likely will never be the cheapest company in terms of SG&A spend. There are things that we invest in, whether it\u2019s IT or marketing related things, that we think benefit the business and contribute to both the engagement of our workforce, the experience of our consumers, the gross margins that we generate, so we think we run a pretty tight ship. We think we\u2019re leveraging as we grow, and I think that\u2019s how you should think about it as we go forward. Susan Maklari : Okay, all right. That\u2019s helpful. My next question is around capital allocation. I know you mentioned that you\u2019re forecasting or estimating about $4 billion of land spend this year, which is up about 8%. Obviously you\u2019ve got plenty of cash on the balance sheet, you\u2019ve been buying back the stock. What else should we be kind of expecting in terms of capital allocation, anything else that\u2019s changed in there? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, good news, Susan, is nothing\u2019s changed. We still have a desire to invest in the business when we\u2019re constructive, as we are today. I think you see that both in terms of the year-over-year growth and even the increase that we\u2019ve highlighted for investment this year, up 8% versus what we thought at the beginning of the year, which is a pretty sizeable increase over the prior year. We\u2019ve obviously demonstrated a willingness to work the dividend through time, the share repurchase authorization and the activity during this most recent quarter, and you should expect us to be doing, on some level, all of those things going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Deepa Raghavan : Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Ryan, I\u2019ll start with a high level question. The industry seems to be struggling to meet even this 1.5 million starts for this year, given the supply chain constraints. Do you think we will be ready for a higher number next year, say 1.8 million starts or so? Any high level thoughts on what needs to happen to get us to a higher number, and is it even realistic to expect a 1.8 next year? Ryan Marshall : Yes, candidly I think the supply chain challenges are bigger than just housing. I think nearly every industry across the globe is dealing with shortages of various materials. Sometimes those are major parts and pieces and sometimes they\u2019re microchips that cost less than a dollar. I think in terms of does the industry have capacity, I think we do. I think we have the land pipeline, I think we have the labor base, I think there\u2019s just some sand in the gears related to certain materials. The things that are having the biggest impact on us right now are windows, to a lesser degree certain lumber components and components needed to manufacture lumber-related pieces, and then candidly, I think in terms of the ability to increase start rate bigger than the current supply challenges, it\u2019s going to be land, titled developed land, so we\u2019ve all really worked to put more on the balance sheet to move things through the entitlement process, but over the long haul I think that\u2019s the constraint that we should be focused on, as opposed to what I think are mostly short term supply chain issues. Deepa Raghavan : Got it, but you think from a land perspective, 1.8 which is pretty much under control of the housing industry, not necessarily the [indiscernible] industry, within what is in your control with this land, 1.8 is still not necessarily off the table, it\u2019s still on the table? Ryan Marshall : Well, I only control what goes on inside of our shop. I know that we\u2019ve got a healthy land pipeline, as indicated by the 207,000 lots we control. In terms of what the entire industry has and where that\u2019s at in the overall entitlement development process, I\u2019d probably leave that up to economists that are smarter than I am. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with that we will be ending today\u2019s question and answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Zeumer for any closing comments. Jim Zeumer : Jamie, thank you. Appreciate everybody\u2019s time this morning. Certainly available for the remainder of the day to answer any other questions, and we will look forward to speaking with you on our next quarterly call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with that we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompany today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post an audio replay of this call later today.  As always, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.  Now let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I look forward to speaking with you today about PulteGroup's third quarter operating and financial results. In this morning's press release, you read that our home sale revenues in the third quarter increased by 18% over last year to $3.3 billion, while our gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 26.5%. In combination, top line growth and margin expansion helped drive higher earnings per share of $1.82. This is an increase of 36% over the prior year's third quarter adjusted earnings of $1.34 per share. Inclusive of these strong third quarter numbers through the first 9 months of 2021, our home sale revenues were up 22% to $9.2 billion while our reported earnings per share are up 36% to $4.85. The resulting strong cash flow being generated by our operations continues to put our company in an enviable position in which we can invest in our business, return funds to shareholders and still maintain outstanding balance sheet strength and overall liquidity.  More specifically, consistent with our constructive view on the housing market, we have invested $2.9 billion in land acquisition and development so far this year. Our $2.9 billion of land spend is comparable to what we invested for the full year in both 2020 and in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, and we remain fully on track to invest approximately $4 billion in total for the full year of 2021.  I would highlight that while we are investing more into the business, we remain disciplined and focused on building a more efficient and lower-risk land pipeline. At the end of the third quarter, our lots under option had grown to 54% of our total controlled lot position compared to when I set the initial 50% option target, we have over 65,000 more lots under option and now view 50% as the floor rather than the ceiling in terms of how we control our land assets.  Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, along with investing $948 million more in land acquisition and development through the first 9 months of 2021 compared with last year, we have also returned $726 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and have paid off nearly $800 million in debt this year, leaving us with a net debt-to-capital ratio of only 5.7%. Finally, consistent with our strategic focus, our operating and financial performance has helped drive a return on equity of 26% for the trailing 12 months. Just like the broader economy, our operations continue to be impacted by the pandemic. On one hand, we are managing through the disruptions COVID-19 and the Delta variant have inflicted on our workforce, our trade partners and the global supply chain. On the other hand, our results have certainly benefited from the remarkable demand and pricing environment the homebuilding industry has experienced over the past 18 months. Either way, to deliver our third quarter numbers during the global pandemic and with a supply chain that is clearly struggling reflects the commitment and tireless efforts of the entire PulteGroup team.  Since we updated our production guidance in early September, broader industry comments have validated the challenges within the construction supply chain are significant and don't have any quick fixes. Based on a myriad of calls and questions we have received, I think it's hard for everyone to appreciate the full magnitude of the issues we're facing when you're not dealing with them on a day-to-day basis. For some products, it's simply the materials aren't available. Sometimes you can switch to an alternative. But when you can, you wait. For others, it's changing lead times where order fulfillment has gone from 6 weeks to 16 weeks, back to 11 weeks and then back to 16 weeks. And for others, it's seeing allocations being imposed as manufacturers and distributors do their best to keep their major customers, which I would note we are one, at least partially satisfied. Our local divisions may not get much advanced notice of the shortage resulting allocations so we have to adjust on the fly.  In other cases, it's logistics. When you're forced to ship materials to solve near-term issues, this might be shipping siding from the Southeast to the Southwest or our trades driving across the state for paint. In one form or another, these issues impacted our third quarter results and, as Bob will detail, will put additional pressure on our deliveries and margins in the fourth quarter. As difficult and frustrating as this is, I can say that our suppliers have been outstanding partners and routinely bend over backwards to get us the materials we need to solve our issues.  I can say that we've been clear with our teams that we have to be -- that we have to overcommunicate with customers to keep them informed of any schedule changes. We also have to be flexible and creative in sourcing materials even if this means spending additional dollars to acquire needed resources. And finally, we must maintain our standards on the quality and completeness of each home that we deliver. Given the very problems impacting the supply chain, we would expect a solution that -- we would expect that solutions will be found over different time lines, depending on the suppliers' underlying issue. In the interim, we will adjust our production estimates for the fourth quarter and work to position the business for more consistent cadence in the year ahead. We will also continue to work in close partnership with our suppliers to manage through the supply chain issues as quickly and as intelligently as possible.  Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of our third quarter results. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. Our teams have done an outstanding job navigating through the challenging production environment, which can be seen in the exceptional operating and financial results we delivered in the quarter. Starting with our income statement. Our home sale revenues for the third quarter increased 18% over last year to $3.3 billion. The increase in revenues was driven by a 9% increase in closings to 7,007 homes in combination with an 8% or $37,000 increase in average sales price to $474,000. The higher average sales price realized in the third quarter reflects meaningful price increases we've realized across all buyer groups, with first-time up 8%, move-up up 10% and active adult up 8%. The mix of homes we delivered in the third quarter included 32% from first-time buyers, 44% from move-up buyers and 24% from active adult buyers. In last year's third quarter, 30% of homes delivered were first-time, 45% were move-up and 25% were active adult.  Our net new orders for the third quarter were 6,796 homes, which represents a 17% decrease from last year that was driven primarily by a 14% decline in year-over-year community count. In addition to fewer open communities, orders for the period were impacted by ongoing actions to manage sales paces to better align with current production volumes. The actions to manage sales pace and outright restrict sales were more frequently targeted toward our first-time buyer communities as we strategically work to build up spec inventory within our Centex branded communities.  Looking at our third quarter orders in a little more detail. Our orders from first-time buyers decreased 20% compared with last year. This decrease was driven primarily by our actions to restrict sales as our first-time community count was only down 6% compared with last year. In contrast, our orders from move-up and active adult buyers decreased 22% and 4%, respectively, which was driven by comparable 22% and 5% decreases in community count, respectively.  In the third quarter, we operated from an average of 768 communities. Consistent with the guide in our recent market update, this is down 14% from last year's average of 892 communities. Our Q3 community count should be the low watermark for the year as we expect our fourth quarter community count to increase to approximately 775 active communities.  Further, our existing land pipeline should allow us to realize a meaningful ramp-up in community count as we move through 2022. As is our practice, we will provide more specifics on 2022 community count as part of our fourth quarter earnings call.  Our unit backlog at the end of the third quarter was up 33% over last year to 19,845 homes. The dollar value of our backlog increased an even greater 56% to $10.3 billion as we benefited from robust price increases realized over the course of this year. At the end of the third quarter, we had 18,802 homes under construction, of which 83% were sold and 17% re-spec. We have almost 900 more spec homes in production than we did in the second quarter as we have been working to increase spec availability, particularly in our Centex communities. In many instances, this has meant tightly controlling current period order rates, but we feel this is the appropriate action as we seek to better align our sales with the current pace of production.  Given that 90% of our specs are early in the construction cycle and we have only 109 finished specs, these units are about helping to position the company for 2022, rather than providing closings in 2021. We faced similar dynamics within our production of sold units as 2/3 of these homes are in the earlier stages of construction, and we can see gaps in the supply of key building products needed to complete these homes. Given these conditions, we believe it appropriate to update our fourth quarter guide for expected fourth quarter deliveries and currently expect to deliver approximately 8,500 homes in the fourth quarter, which would represent an increase of 24% over the fourth quarter of last year.  It's difficult to say there are positives to be gleaned from the challenging production environment, but one of the outcomes is that the limited supply of homes, coupled with ongoing strong demand, has supported higher prices across the market. Reflective of these conditions, our average price in backlog increased 18% or $78,000 over last year to $519,000. Although more than half of our quarter end backlog is expected to deliver in 2022, we will continue to see the benefit of rising prices in our fourth quarter as our average closing price is expected to be $485,000 to $490,000. At the midpoint, this would represent an increase of approximately 10% over last year. Our reported homebuilding gross margin in the third quarter increased 200 basis points over last year to 26.5%. Given that our third quarter closings absorbed the elevated lumber prices from earlier this year, expanding our gross margin by 200 basis points attest to the strong pricing environment the industry experienced over the past year. It's worth noting that the strong market conditions also contributed to another step down in incentives in the period as discounts fell to 1.3%. This is down from 3% last year and down 60 basis points from the second quarter of this year.  As our margin increase demonstrates, strong buyer demand has allowed the company to pass through the higher labor and material costs we've experienced. That said and as Ryan discussed, we are knowingly incurring additional expenses to get houses built within today's challenged operating environment. In addition to the incremental build costs we are absorbing over the short term to get homes completed, our reported gross margins are being influenced by the mix of homes closed. As we also highlighted in our recent market update, certain of the homes that we expected to close in Q3 slipped into Q4 and others have been pushed out of the fourth quarter into 2022. These conditions are impacting our reported gross margins in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 but set us up to realize gross margin expansion as we head into 2022.  That said, with the changing mix of homes we currently expect to close in the fourth quarter, coupled with the added material, labor and logistics costs we're paying to get homes closed, we currently expect our fourth quarter gross margin to be 26.6% or 26.7%. This would represent an increase of 160 to 170 basis points over last year's fourth quarter and an increase of 10 to 20 basis points over the third quarter of this year. We see the opportunity to build on this momentum as the strong pricing conditions we've experienced, coupled with the lower lumber costs we expect in next year's closings, should result in further gross margin expansion in 2022.  Our SG&A expense for the third quarter was $321 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues. Prior year SG&A expense for the period was $271 million for a comparable 9.6% home sale revenues. Given there's still increase in closings, we expect [Technical Difficulty] in the upcoming quarter expected to fall to a range of 8.9% to 9.2% of home sale revenues. Looking at our financial services operations. Our third quarter pretax income was $49 million versus $64 million last year. As has been the case for much of this year, higher origination volumes have been offset by lower profitability per loan given more competitive market conditions. The company's reported tax expense in the third quarter was $145 million, for an effective tax rate of 23.3%. In the comparable prior year period, our effective rate was 14% as we realized a tax benefit of $53 million associated with energy tax credits recognized in the period. For the third quarter, our reported net income was $476 million or $1.82 per share. This compares with prior year adjusted net income, excluding the impact of the energy tax credits, of $363 million or $1.34 per share.  Moving over to the balance sheet. Our business continues to generate strong cash flow, which allowed us to end the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash after significant investment in the business and continued shareholder distributions in the quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares or about 2% of our outstanding common shares for $261 million at an average price of $51.07 per share. The $261 million in stock repurchase is a sequential increase of $61 million from the second quarter of this year. As stated previously, we are fully prepared to allocate more capital to shareholders as conditions warrant.  We also invested $1.1 billion in land acquisition and development in the third quarter. This brings our total land-related spend in 2021 to $2.9 billion and keeps us on track to invest approximately $4 billion of land acquisition and development for the year, which would be an increase of almost 40% over last year. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 22.4%, which is down from 29.5% at the end of last year. Adjusting for our cash position, our net debt-to-capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 5.7%. We ended the third quarter with approximately 223,000 lots under control, of which 54% were controlled through options. Our divisions and particularly our land teams have done an outstanding job building a more efficient land bank while helping to reduce market risk. We're extremely proud of their efforts and the success that they've realized.  Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Ryan Marshall : Book ending the front of this call where I talked about supply, let me finish the call by providing a few comments about third quarter demand, which is a very positive picture. We continue to experience strong demand in the quarter with very consistent traffic and sign-up numbers across the period. I would also add that strong demand has continued through the first few weeks of October. While sign-ups in the quarter were lower compared with last year, the primary driver of the decline was the decrease in community count. Beyond the impact community count had on order rates in the quarter, our divisions continue to manage or outright restrict sales pace to better match sales with our current production. As Bob indicated, this most recent quarter should be the low point of our community count -- should be the low point of our community count this year as we expect our community count to move higher on a sequential basis as we move through 2022. Reflecting the strong demand conditions and relatively limited supply of new and existing homes, we were able to raise prices in the quarter across most of our communities. The most typical increase in the quarter was in the range of 1% to 3%, although some of our divisions were able to push pricing in select communities a little more aggressively. That being said, we continue to keep a close eye on affordability metrics within our local markets, especially given the recent rise in mortgage rates. Between an improving economy, a strong jobs market, wage inflation and government stimulus checks, consumers are in a very strong financial position and have proven they are prepared to pay today's higher prices for everything, from food to autos to homes. We continue to see a very strong financial profile among our homebuyers with the average FICO score remaining above 7 50 and loan-to-value of 83% based on users of our mortgage company.  Looking at demand across the country. I would tell you that generally where we have product available, we can sell it and at a higher price than earlier in the year. Although frustrated at times because of limited supply, higher prices and longer build cycles, consumers remain engaged in the home buying process and are anxious to get into a new home.  Just to wrap up, while there are certainly challenges in the business, PulteGroup remains in an excellent position, both operationally and financially. We have a strong and improving land pipeline that we continue to make more efficient through the use of lot options. We have an opportunity to further expand margins based on limited supply, strong buyer demand, resulting favorable pricing dynamics and lower lumber costs in 2022. We have an outstanding homebuilding operation that is generating tremendous cash flow, and we have an exceptional balance sheet strength and liquidity that can support our operations and gives us tremendous flexibility to capitalize on market opportunities.  Let me close by again thanking our employees for their tireless efforts to serve our homebuyers and deliver outstanding business performance. Now let me turn the call back to Jim. James Zeumer : Great. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Julie will now open the queue for questions and answers. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Truman Patterson : First, I wanted to touch on gross margin. Is there any way you could just quantify the elevated costs you've incurred that will impact the fourth quarter? And then in the prepared remarks, you mentioned '22 gross margin likely moving higher, which I think there's been a lot of investor uncertainty on that. So with prices moving up, lumber coming down, other costs accelerated -- accelerating, can you just help us think through the gross margin in backlog or kind of the incoming orders? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. I'll start with the fourth quarter, Truman. We obviously have taken down our margin expectation for Q4 depending on which where you pegged the margin, call it, 60 or 70 basis points from what we had originally guided. And I would suggest the way to think about that is we've got mix changes very consistent with what we had in the third quarter as stuff has moved out of the fourth quarter into '22. That's probably 30 basis points of it. And then incremental costs -- and you heard us talk about it in the prepared remarks, to get things done today is about $2,000 a house for us, which is about 40 basis points. And so that's sort of the magnitude of what we're seeing in the fourth quarter.  We didn't provide a guide for '22 gross margins, but we obviously did highlight the significant pricing that we're seeing in our backlog. It's up $78,000 a unit or 18%. Plus, we'll have lower lumber cost. Now lumber is variable. It's moved down. It moved up a little bit. We'll see where that lands. But we'll see, on a sequential basis, as we get into '22, some decreases. So certainly, the structure is there for lower margins. We'll give an estimate of what that is as we release our fourth quarter... Truman Patterson : Higher margins. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Did I say lower? My apologies. Higher margins in '22.. Truman Patterson : Okay. That can... Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Jim, had a hard look on his face. I apologize for that. And we'll give you some visibility to that as we release our fourth quarter earnings, and we'll have obviously better visibility into the year at that point. Truman Patterson : Okay, okay. And then on the supply chain constraints, I realize it's kind of a moving target and it varies by the metro. But I'm just hoping you could run through where the most common pressure points are in the supply chain. And on the material side, any highlights on the vendors? Are they giving you a time line as to when they expect their internal capacity begins improving and actually increasing product in '22? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Truman, it's Ryan. It really depends on the region, Truman. So in like the Florida regions, there are challenges with block. Most of our homes that are built out of concrete block as opposed to lumber. So we've been on allocation there for a number of months. Windows, I would tell you, generally, across the entire United States, are a pressure point. Paint is a pressure point. and appliances would be some things that I think are common across the entire enterprise. And then when you get into certain regions, things like siding become a pain point, depending on how much of that we use in the construction of our homes in those regions.  In terms of kind of when things are solved, Truman, as I tried to highlight in my prepared remarks, we think that the time line of fixing things will be varied. And it really depends on what the underlying issue is for that particular distributor or manufacturer. There are some things that are obviously relying on microchips like appliances. And I think that those challenges are well detailed. In some cases, it's chemicals and things like resin. I think the paint suppliers, paint manufacturers have kind of highlighted some of the things they've done. In particular, Sherwin Williams recently purchased their own resin plants in order to help solidify some of the challenges that they've had in obtaining resin.  And then in some cases, it's logistics. And so there's just simply not enough transportation capacity to move things from the ports to the distribution centers or from the factories to our job sites. And so I think we're going to end up with is a mixed bag of results and recovery time lines as we move through 2022. The relationships that we have with our suppliers are outstanding. We're communicating actively with them and collaboratively solving problems. I think we're being treated very well with our suppliers, and they're bending over backwards to take care of us and the significant volume that we do of new homes. So I'm going to remain optimistic, but there's no doubt there are some headwinds out there that we're fighting through each and every day. As Bob highlighted, we'll talk more about 2022 as we get to the end of the fourth quarter, which is when we customarily provide our guidance. But there are -- there's some favorable things with community count growth, opportunity for margin expansion, et cetera, that I think leave reason to continue to be optimistic. Operator : And your next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman. Alan Ratner : So first question, I'd love to dig in a little bit to the pricing environment. I believe you indicated kind of the typical price increases were about 1% to 3% in the quarter. Your average order price was up way more than that, up 9%. So I'm guessing the delta there is mix. But I'm curious if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of pricing power now versus 3 months ago, 6 months ago. A few other builders kind of suggest that maybe pricing power is moderating a bit. It doesn't sound like you're seeing that in your communities, but any color you can give there would be great. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan, I would just -- I'd highlight that the demand environment continues to be very strong. And in most communities, we continue to have pricing power. We're exercising that through price increases, obviously. And in some cases, we're outright restricting sales, which I think is in the same kind of family of actions that we take to manage the demand that we have.  What I would tell you, the -- we highlighted, on average, most communities were 1% to 3%. There were certainly some communities that were well in excess of that. Those kind of outlier communities, combined with the fact that you do have some mix in there as well as, I think, contributes to the incremental increase that you highlighted in your question.  In terms of kind of where things are at today pricing power-wise relative to a quarter ago, 2 quarters ago, I'd suggest it's pretty comparable to where we were at in Q2, a little weaker than where we were at in Q1 in terms of kind of month-over-month or week-over-week pricing changes. We are keeping eye on affordability. We highlighted that in our prepared remarks. I think it's something that while the consumer continues to be strong financially, they don't have unlimited financial means and resources. And so we need to be mindful of that, not only as a company, but as an industry. Alan Ratner : Great. I appreciate that, Ryan. Second, maybe more for Bob, but the $2,000 per house incremental cost you talked about, I'm just curious when you kind of qualitatively talk about the '22 margin outlook in terms of improvement, what's the assumption on that piece? Are you assuming that that's a temporary headwind that goes away as the supply chain normalizes? Do you think that it even goes higher if builders are kind of cramming to try to get more specs on the ground? What's the assumption embedded within the outlook for margin improvement next year? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, to be clear, we haven't given a margin expectation for next year. And part of the reason for that, Alan, is because we want to give ourselves the opportunity to really evaluate that question more fully. Certainly, the supply chain is not going to cure itself in the next 3 months, probably not the next 6. Anybody's guess as to how long beyond that. And so there will be continued constraints.  You also have kind of working in the other direction that most builders are kind of pushing towards their year-end in Q3 and Q4, so there's more kind of demand for service and materials. And that will mitigate to a degree in the first half of next year. So I think a lot of it will depend on how the supply chain kind of moves forward from here. And again, it's one of the reasons that we are waiting until the fourth quarter, not just convention, but also we think we'll get better information as we get into December, January, I can answer that question more fully. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Michael Rehaut : First, I just wanted to talk a little bit about capital allocation. Obviously, not just in terms of share repurchase, but maybe just to shift the question a little bit on lot optioning and lot owning. A lot of progress on lot optioning. But actually, if you look at the year's owned, it's sitting around 3.8, 3.9 in terms of -- 3.8, 3.7 in terms of years on supply, any thoughts around trying to get that metric down over the next 2 or 3 years? And as a result, I'd presume that it would free up even more cash to perhaps return to shareholders or invest in the company in other ways. Ryan Marshall : Mike, it's Ryan. Yes, in terms of capital allocation, I'm really proud of what we were able to do in the quarter. The health and the quality of the homebuilding operations continues to generate outstanding cash flows. And so we were able to do a lot in the quarter. We're very pleased with the total amount of land that we've been able to invest in, in the year. We sit at right at $3 billion year-to-date and are on track for $4 billion, which will be a big year for the company. We had an outstanding quarter of returning funds to shareholders, and that's something that is very consistent with -- and right in line with our capital allocation philosophy of investing in the business and returning funds to shareholders. So I think 2 kind of very solid checkmarks there.  As it relates to, Mike, your question on land pipeline, the thing that I'd highlight is that we've got 54% of our controlled pipeline under option. We've set a target of 50%. We've passed that number, and it's something that we really are pleased with, what our teams have been able to do to continue to maintain optionality with the overall land supply.  Turning to your question on 3.7 of years supply, Mike, that number would be calculated using the trailing 12 months closings. I think that's certainly an acceptable convention in terms of how you would look at what the own pipeline is. That number is less if you look forward, and I realize we haven't given visibility to what that forward number is. But I think we've very clearly highlighted our desire to grow. And you've seen the early end of that with the amount of capital that we've been investing into the business.  So the other thing that I'd also just mentioned, and we've been consistent in stating that we haven't changed our land underwriting guidelines, and we continue to approve land deals that are right in line with our target of 3 years owned land. Michael Rehaut : Okay. That's helpful, Ryan. I appreciate it. I guess, secondly, in -- and I apologize to you for this question in advance because I know it's a little bit of beating a dead horse, but we are getting some inbound client questions around it. The understanding that you can't -- you're not giving -- you're not quantifying gross margins for next year, you did say that you expect improvement. And I believe you're talking about improvement off of 4Q levels. So I was just trying to get a sense of is that all kind of on the lumber benefit maybe exceeding other areas of cost inflation. Or are there other drivers to that initial, at least directional, guidance, so to speak? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike. It's a fair question, and I realize that there's a lot of interest in this area from investors, and we're anticipating getting to the end of the fourth quarter when we can kind of give you more of a guide. The biggest driver is price, Mike, and I think you've seen that over the course of the year. You see what's happened in our backlog. And so that ought to give you a reasonable information to use and how much is there. We've highlighted the fact that our highest lumber loads are coming in Q3 and Q4, and we start to get benefits as we move into Q1 and Q2 of next year. So there's a lot of benefit there on the lumber side. As we're experiencing today, not only in Q3 but also Q4, we've got some incremental costs that we're paying today. And as Bob suggested to one of the prior questions, we've got to see what the next 3 to 4 months look like in terms of how much of that we'll continue to have to pay. And they're essentially bounties. We're spending money above and beyond what we've contracted for in order to get the homes across the finish line at the quality standard that we expect. So I know it's less than a fulsome answer, but we're going to leave it as we currently see room for margin expansion next year, and I'm going to probably leave it at that. Operator : Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : You've been building a second off-site manufacturing facility in South Carolina. Wondering if you could talk about the progress there. And then just from a big-picture perspective, when you think about the kind of extreme supply chain pressure that you're seeing, does that sort of validate the off-site manufacturing approach and increase the urgency there? Or does it present new challenges for that model where you might have to dial things back a bit? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Anthony, thanks for the question. We are in the process of fitting out that space in South Carolina. We'd expect to be delivering product out of there in mid-2022. So that's on track at this point in time. In terms of kind of broader supply chain implications, I would tell you that the primary reason that we continue to roll out and expand our off-site manufacturing capability is related to labor availability. And we really believe that the automated nature of those off-site facilities will help to -- help us weather what will be a prolonged labor headwind within the space over the next 8 to 10 years as the current labor force continues to age out. So the current supply chain challenges, I think, are more around raw materials and more around logistics and truck drivers candidly.  So while certainly having your own facilities, you're in a bit more control of your destiny, those factories need raw materials as well. And clearly, those are in short supply. So we remain very optimistic and bullish about what the off-site facilities can do for our business and remain on the path of building 6 to 8 of these facilities over the next number of years. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then is it possible to say what percentage of your communities are still restricting sales? And other than the lower community count impacting some of the early traffic in October, is there any other trend that you'd call out between buyer type or geography that you might see is driving some sort of cooling or normalization of demand? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. We are still restricting sales in more than half of our communities today. And even in the ones where we're not, we're seeing strong traffic such that when we bring lots to market we're able to sell them. I don't think -- I'm looking at Ryan and Jim. Any other trends? I've nothing of note, no. Ryan Marshall : Well, the only other trend I'd highlight is that we've actually seen continued strength as we've moved out of Q3 and into October. I think, normally, you would see some seasonality in sales paces and trends, and we're quite pleased with the activity that we've seen so far sitting here in the third week of October. Operator : And your next question comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Matthew Bouley : So on the active adult business, obviously, kind of a less severe community decline, and it sounds like less sales restrictions in those communities, perhaps given the depth of available product and lots you've got there. Is it fair to assume that the mix of active adult delivery shift should, therefore, be higher in '22? And I'm curious if you could remind us how the margin and return profile on that product might look compared to the rest of the business. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: In terms of forward mix, it varies by quarter. Candidly, in the current quarter, it was about 29% of our sign-ups. Prior year, it was about 25%. So you may see a 1% or 2% or 3% kind of mix shift. Interestingly, given the way the market has behaved, there isn't a significant difference today in the margin profile of that business versus the move-up or entry level. So I don't think it causes any significant change and it hasn't really for the last couple of years. The market is pretty strong across the board. You saw 8% price increase first-time, 10% move-up, 8% active adults. So we're seeing kind of that rising tide lift all boats. Matthew Bouley : Got it. Okay. No, that's very helpful there, Bob. Second one, just on the topic of the sales restrictions and supply chain. Obviously, the reduction to delivery guidance for Q4. I'm curious how we should think about the kind of balance of these production bottlenecks, which is kind of unpredictable how long this will last, versus the rebuilding of spec inventory that you've now been doing for quite some time. Is it realistic that, as we get into the spring, you might see a normal or even greater-than-normal uptick in both spec sales and deliveries associated with that just as you worked so hard on kind of rebuilding inventory homes? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Matt, it's Ryan. We have worked hard to get more spec into the pipeline. I think we've been highlighting for the last 2 or 3 quarters that ideal for us is to be 25% to 30% of our total inventory -- of our total inventory stack. We're -- we've got 1,000 more specs in the pipeline today than we did a year ago. So we're very happy about that. It's still only 17% of our total production. So we're a full 10% to kind of 13% below where we'd optimally like to be. So it's better.  We highlighted the fact that where we've restricted sales more is in our first-time communities. That also happens to be where we're rebuilding that spec pipeline. So look, if we can continue to have some success there, we can move those units along, we can get them closer to being ready for delivery. That's when you put those on the market for that buyer group. And certainly, our hope would be that we've got more available to sell as we move through Q4 and into Q1 next year. Operator : And your next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Dahl : Wanted to follow up first with a question around pricing power because it does seem like your comments and your results suggest a little more positive tone around pricing than I think some peers has alluded to earlier, have talked about more recently. And that's consistent in the work that we've tracked as well. So I guess the question is, when you look at kind of the sales restrictions, when you look at your balance of price versus pace, do you think that you're acting in a way that's different than peers right now and still pushing a little more price and later on a little more in terms of restrictions than some of your peers? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, I'm not -- I'm probably not in a position to make a great comparison there with specific data other than anecdotally. The one thing I would highlight is, I think, it's the benefit of our build-to-order model. In our build-to-order model, I think we continue to give customers the ability to choose their lot, their floor plan and to personalize the home in the way that they see the most value. And so I do think that our strategic pricing model, which we probably haven't talked about as much over the last couple of quarters because things have been so frenzy, I think that does continue to give us some pricing power that's a competitive advantage relative to our peers would be probably the biggest thing that I would highlight. Related to that model, a big component of it is the option in the lot premiums, and that's up 7% year-over-year. So we've seen some nice growth from those 2 things, which are, I think, you all appreciate big contributors to our overall margin and profitability. Michael Dahl : Got it. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And my follow-up, it's somewhat related slight variation. But when we look at the pace, it's sitting at a little below 3 a month in terms of orders. And I think the closing is right around 3 a month. Even some peers at kind of the middle of higher end of the price spectrum right now, I think, are putting up pace and construction starts a little bit north of that. So it does seem like you're going outside the lines in terms of like paying up to get what you can across the finish line. But I guess I'm wondering, are there some things that you're seeing in the market where you're just saying that just doesn't make sense? We're going to -- we've paid up the $2,000, but this extra piece just -- we can't justify it. So we'll either keep the restrictions or we're going to push out the deliveries depending on when -- whether you're looking at orders or closing.  So I guess without talking specifically about your -- any of your competitors, are there certain areas in the market that you're just choosing not to be as aggressive to get things closed today versus what you theoretically could? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Mike, there's a lot in that question. So let me unpack a few pieces, and I'm going to start with absorptions per community. We -- what I'd start with is I'd reiterate the continued strong demand that we've seen from consumers, not only in the quarter, but what's continued into October. If -- our orders and absorptions in the quarter, while maybe lower than what we would have liked, I'd want to highlight a couple of things. Number one, except for entry level, the absorptions that we had in the quarter were consistent with what we had in the prior year. So Bob highlighted that in his prepared remarks. The change there was completely driven by the community count decline. The exception to that is entry level, where we had more -- we had lower absorptions and lower sign-ups relative to the drop that we saw on the community count.  The area that I'd probably highlight is Texas. Texas is a state where we have a lot of entry-level Centex communities, and that happens to be a place where we've significantly restricted lot sales as we rebuild that spec pipeline. So all in all, we feel really good about the way that homes are selling and the underlying demand that continues to be there. In terms of cost, Mike, I would tell you, I think we're doing things where we believe we can make a difference. So if we can get the material, if we can put it on a truck, if we can send somebody to the other side of the state to pick it up and get it, we're going to do it. And I don't -- I think the added costs are to simply compensate people for the extra time and effort that's going into getting it done. So I don't feel that we're doing anything unreasonable or being held hostage to do anything.  We're also really thinking about our customer. That's something that we put first and foremost in everything we do. We're really proud of the quality of the homes that we build. And so we're not going to deliver incomplete homes or rush things across the finish line that we don't believe meet our quality standards. And we're kind of unwavering on that.  So in terms of kind of how much we're paying relative to what our competitors are paying, I think my sense is we're very competitive there. I don't think we're doing anything that would be out of line relative to the competition. So we feel pretty good about what we've been able to do given the operating conditions that not only this industry is in, the whole world is in. Operator : And your next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore. Stephen Kim : I wanted to drill in on the 4Q gross margin guide. You talked about, I think, 70 basis points -- guiding about 70 basis points lower than what you had done previously. And you had indicated, I think, that 40 basis points of that was sort of these extra costs, maybe 30 basis points was mix. So within the extra cost, I wanted to clarify that this is actually what I guess you could call scrambling costs, like just scrambling around to try to get these homes closed and whatnot, generalized -- general input cost inflation. Because of that, you would expect to sort of persist. But sort of the scrambling around kind of cost you would expect to dissipate. So I just wanted to clarify that 40 basis points of extra costs is, in fact, not just generalized input cost inflation. And if you could provide maybe some additional color around what kind of -- these unusual costs you're doing, like are you warehousing products just to make sure that you have them on hand when you need them? If you could give some color around that, that would be helpful. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Stephen, you summarized it correctly. It's -- I wouldn't have thought of scrambling costs, but it's not a bad descriptor. We, in our more recent commentary, told folks that we saw kind of 9% to 11% inflationary costs. And we're still there, and this is just the things we're doing above and beyond that to get stuff done. And you heard Ryan talk about some of those in his prepared remarks. Literally, paint suppliers don't have paint, so we're asking people to drive to go buy paint in retail stores. That's not normal. It's not the way we do business. We are shipping trusses from market A to market B. Again -- because there was a truss factory buyer in market B that limited the production capability there.  And there are myriad examples of that. And they're different for different types of construction. They are different, different markets for us. You kind of mash it all together, and that's the $2,000 a unit. So on some units, it might not be much at all. On others, it might be $8,000, depending on the circumstance. That kind of blend to that $2,000. I might steal scrambling costs, so thank you for that. Ryan Marshall : Yes. Stephen, and I would highlight, you mentioned it, we're warehousing things like windows. If we can get them, we are ordering them earlier than we need them. You're putting them in a storage unit or a warehouse, and we're hauling those windows when we need it. So that's part of those incremental costs as well. Stephen Kim : Great. And then just to make sure that I'm crystal clear on it, this $2,000, is that the total amount of these sort of unusual costs? Or is that simply the increment from what you had previously thought you might have to absorb these kind of special costs 3 months ago? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: These are incremental costs as we've kind of -- we're 3 months smarter, Stephen, because of what we're seeing in the field real-time. Stephen Kim : Right. So that's just the change from 3 months ago. That's not necessarily the total? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Correct, correct. Stephen Kim : I imagine 3 months ago you anticipated something -- okay. Got it. Just to make sure. And then the 30 basis points that relates -- I think you indicated mix. And I just wanted to make sure I understood what that mix was because you've indicated that margins are pretty similar across the 3 product types. Maybe there's some regional differences. But I just wanted to understand what that mix was. And then also one thing you didn't really specifically mention in the 30 and the 40 basis points was lumber. Is lumber going to hit 4Q worse than you had expected 3 months ago? And is it going to be a heavier sort of drag on your margins than it was in 3Q? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Stephen, the mix commentary is not on product, it's on geography. And we had highlighted that in the market update in our conversations then. Essentially, what has happened is the margins on some of the units that got pushed from Q3 into Q4 were higher-margin units. And similarly, the ones that got pushed from Q4 into next year are higher-margin units. Part of that is just where they are in the production cycle, part of it is geography in terms of where they are. We always highlight that mix matters. We will get that margin. It's just a little bit later than we thought. And in terms of lumber, no, we have pretty good visibility into our lumber pricing. We know what the lumber packs are going to be on our -- we knew what they were on Q3. We know what they are in Q4. We have pretty good visibility into what they're going to be next year. And so that wasn't -- the lumber component hasn't changed in what we thought and what we're guiding. Ryan Marshall : But there is more in Q4 than there was in Q3, which I think we've also highlighted for a number of quarters, Stephen, that the highest load was coming in Q4. And that's incorporated and has been incorporated into the guide that we've given. Operator : And your final question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Eric Bosshard : Two things. First of all, the change in 4Q on gross margin, that's helpful to clarify. I think the delivery number is different in 4Q and relative to what you said 45 days ago. Can you just explain what changed in regards to that relative to 45 days ago? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Eric, thanks for the question. It is different than what we highlighted 45 days ago. And I think it's just the continued disruption that is going on in the supply chain world. So every day, as we move things down the production line, we're making an assessment as to whether or not it will deliver in the quarter. There were homes that were in production where we were anticipating getting certain supplies that we needed in order to meet a Q4 delivery. And once you cross kind of certain kind -- kind of critical path dates, you start to run out of days where you can compress schedules. And so candidly, things slide. Our run rate at this point in time is 100 to 150 homes a day. So you lose 2, 3, 4 days of time due to delays, and the numbers -- the numbers have been adjusted as we've indicated today. Eric Bosshard : Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, the conviction in community count growth, 3Q being the bottom, the improvement from here, just a little bit of color for why you have the conviction in the progress and the magnitude of the progress. Ryan Marshall : Yes. So we've got great visibility into the land that we own and the -- specifically which communities that, that land is allocated to. We've got good visibility into how those communities are moving through the entitlement and the development process. Certainly, those are subject to or run the risk of delays just like the vertical side. But given what we see in our pipeline and adjusting for what we think will be headwinds next year, we are very confident that we'll see community count growth and expansion into next year. So we'll give you the specific numbers at the end of Q4, Eric, but we're confident enough that we've hit the low point that we can give you at least a preview that we'll see expansion in Q4 and nice expansion into next year as well. Operator : Thank you. This is all the time we have for questions today. I will turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. James Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Julie. I appreciate everybody's time this morning. Certainly be available over the course of the day to answer any follow-up questions, and we look forward to speaking with you on the next call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Rob. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. We look forward to discussing PulteGroup's outstanding fourth quarter earnings for the period ended December 31, 2021. I'm joined on today's call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior VP, Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post an audio replay of today's call later. I want to highlight that we will be discussing our reported fourth quarter numbers, as well as our results adjusted to exclude the impact of certain reserve adjustments and tax benefits recorded in the period. A reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financials is included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance. Also, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. It's great to speak with you again and to have this opportunity to review PulteGroup's impressive fourth quarter and full year results. I am extremely proud of what our organization has been able to accomplish. For starters, I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for the tremendous effort demonstrated throughout 2021, but particularly in the fourth quarter, from sales to procurement and construction, to our financial services team, you clearly showed what a proud and talented group of determined people can achieve. In a minute, Bob will review our fourth quarter results, but I want to highlight a few of our full year numbers to clearly demonstrate just how much success we've realized over the past 12 months. Even with all the challenges, the homebuilding industry faced in 2021, from supply chain disruptions and labor shortages to municipal delays and COVID waves, we grew our closings by 17% to almost 29,000 homes, benefiting from the very favorable demand and pricing conditions, we increased homebuilding revenues by an even greater 27% to $13.5 billion. We were then able to fully capitalize on this top line growth by expanding gross margins by 210 basis points to 26.4% and driving a 43% increase in our reported full year earnings of $7.43 per share. Our financial discussions tend to focus on the income statement, but I would also highlight that over the past 12 months, we lowered our debt to capital ratio to a historic low of 21.3%, while raising our return on equity to 28%. I would also highlight that over the course of 2021, we continued our disciplined allocation of capital in alignment with our stated priorities. This allocation included investing over $4 billion in land acquisition and land development, increasing our dividend pay rate per share in 2021 by 17%, retiring $726 million of bonds and repurchasing $900 million of stock, reducing our shares outstanding by approximately 6%. There is a lot to be excited about with regard to PulteGroup's 2021 operating and financial results. In assessing our performance, we fully appreciate that we benefited from a very favorable supply and demand dynamics in the marketplace. On the demand side, we saw a strong desire for homeownership across all markets and buyer groups. At one end, we have maturing millennials driving extraordinary demand for first-time and first-move of product, while at the other end, we have empty nesters who are downsizing or retiring into their next stage of life. This demand strength drove an increase of 8% in our 2021 net new orders to almost 32,000 homes, including 6,769 orders in the fourth quarter. The reality is that these numbers could have been significantly higher, but COVID and other challenges impacted our availability of lots, labor and materials, which caused us to intentionally slow sales. As part of our response strategy to these resource constraints, we raised prices in 2021 and actively restricted new home sales through lot releases or similar practices. We continue to implement these actions in the fourth quarter as we raised prices in effectively all our communities. At the same time, we continue to restrict sales in more than half of our communities. The strong demand experienced in the fourth quarter has continued into January with no signs that higher interest rates are impacting the desire for new homes. As we look forward to the year ahead, we are well-positioned to meet the strong demand. We entered 2022 with twice as many spec homes in the production pipeline compared to last year along with a land pipeline that will allow us to expand our community count throughout this year. We also have all the lots we need for our 2022 deliveries and expect to increase our full year gross margins by upwards of 250 basis points. In other words, we entered 2022 with tremendous momentum. While demand conditions are strong, the supply side of the equation has been extremely challenging with no clear signs as to when things will get better. The limited supply of new and existing homes allowed prices to increase by double digits last year, but labor shortages and significant disruptions in the supply chain are limiting production and extending build cycles. Our suppliers and partners are working hard to provide needed resources, but key products that are under allocation must be ordered months in advance or are simply not available. The ongoing surge in COVID infection rates is impacting our suppliers and is also making it very hard for trades to field crews consistently and expanding their teams is an even bigger challenge. Unfortunately, we expect construction processes to remain difficult through much, if not all, of 2022. In response to these challenges, we continue to implement actions to help ensure we can complete high quality homes and grow \u2013 [offer] (ph) deliveries until supply chain issues are resolved. These actions include increasing spec starts, ordering earlier, narrowing option packages and even warehousing inventory of critical building products. These efforts are time consuming and we lose some production efficiencies, but for the foreseeable future, they are required to get homes built. We've said in the past that scale, particularly local scale matters and this is certainly the case today. Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a review of our fourth quarter results. Bob? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. As part of my review of our fourth quarter performance, I'll discuss our reported results and where appropriate review our results adjusted for specific items in the current or prior year quarter. Along with reviewing the company's fourth quarter results, I will also be providing guidance on key performance metrics for both the first quarter and full year 2022. Looking at the income statement. Wholesale revenues in the fourth quarter increased 38% over last year to $4.2 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 26% increase in closings to 8,611 homes, along with a 10% increase in average sales price to $490,000. The higher ASP in the quarter reflects double-digit pricing gains from all buyer groups, while closings came in slightly above guidance, thanks to the tremendous effort on the part of our homebuilding and financial services teams. Consistent with comments made throughout 2021, favorable supply and demand dynamics for housing supported the strong price appreciation we experienced across all markets and from all buyer groups. The mix of closings in the quarter were a direct alignment with our long-term goals and included 34% from first-time buyers, 42% from move-up buyers, and 24% from active adult buyers. Closings in the fourth quarter last year included 31% first time, 46% move up and 23% active adult. Net new orders in the quarter totaled 6,769 homes, which is a decrease of 4% from last year. The decrease in orders reflects a decrease in community count as well as the ongoing actions to manage sales to better align the pace of our sales and production that Ryan mentioned. Our average community count in the quarter was 785, which is down 7% from the prior year. Buyer demand was strong and order volumes were fairly consistent across all three months of the quarter as we didn't experience the typical seasonal drop-off in order volumes as we moved through the quarter. I would note that we continue to experience this strength in demand through January. By buyer group, orders by first-time buyers increased 12% to 2,207 homes, while orders by move-up and active adult buyers both declined 10% to 2,812 homes and 1,750 homes, respectively. The primary drivers of the lower order rates among the move up and active adult buyers was having fewer communities and our decision to restrict sales. We ended the fourth quarter with a large backlog of sold homes, which provides a strong base of production heading into the New Year. On a unit basis, our backlog at year-end was 18,003 homes, which is an increase of 19% over last year. Backlog value at year-end was $9.9 billion, which is an increase of 45% over 2020. Even with the well-documented challenges within the supply chain, I can say that thanks to a lot of hard work by our teams, trades and suppliers, we're getting homes into production. As a result, we ended the year with 18,423 homes under construction, which is up almost 50% over last year. I'm also pleased to report that we've been able to increase our spec production as 23% of homes under construction are spec. This is up from 17% in the third quarter and it's getting us closer to our target of having between 25% and 30% spec. While it's great to see homes getting into production, it's important to note that the overwhelming majority of these units are in the early stages of construction. More specifically, 31% of our production pipeline is at the initial start stage with another 44% of the homes only at the framing stage. At the other end of the production pipeline, we have only 411 finished homes. This figure includes both sold and spec units. Given the number of homes under production and equally important, their stage of construction, we currently expect to deliver between 5,600 and 6,000 homes in the first quarter of 2022. In addition to the challenging production environment Ryan discussed, our Q1 delivery guide reflects the impact of limited finished spec inventory and the longer construction cycle times we're experiencing. For the full year 2022, we expect to deliver 31,000 homes. This estimate assumes no meaningful change in the state of the supply chain and in turn, our current cycle times. If the favorable demand conditions allow us to sell in an even higher year-over-year growth rate, we'll have to see if the supply of materials and labor will be equally supportive. Based on what occurred in 2021, we want to be confident we can deliver a high-quality and complete home at closing. If the supply of labor and materials does not allow for increased production, we'll continue to emphasize price over pace, restrict sales as needed as we focus on driving the best returns within each community. As we move through 2022, we are well positioned to meet buyer demand, given our expectations for sequential increases in our community count throughout the year. For the coming four quarters, we project our average community count to be 790 in Q1, 815 in Q2, 840 in Q3 and 870 in Q4. Given the land investments we've made, we expect this trend to continue and see further community count growth in 2023. As mentioned, strong demand and pricing conditions in 2021 resulted in higher prices across all buyer groups, which has resulted in our average sales price in backlog increasing by 22% compared to last year. Given the price of homes in backlog and the mix of homes we anticipate closing, we expect our average sales price to be between $500,000 and $510,000 in the first quarter. Our average sales price should move higher as we move through the year, and we currently expect our full year average sales price to be approximately $515,000. As always, the ultimate mix of deliveries can influence the average sales price we realized in any given quarter. Driven by the strong price appreciation achieved throughout our markets, our homebuilding gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 180 basis points over last year and 30 basis points sequentially to 26.8%. With 18,000 homes in backlog, we have good visibility on near-term gross margins, but we also know that input costs are moving higher and that we expect to continue to incur what are now commonly called scramble costs, as we work to ensure product and labor availability. Based on what we can see today, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 28.5% to 29% in the first quarter and for the full year. This guide takes into consideration our current construction costs, as well as the recent run-up in lumber prices. Based on these factors, we anticipate being towards the bottom end of the range in the first quarter, but towards the higher end of the range by the end of the year. Speaking of inflation, we are closely monitoring increases that are impacting the cost of labor and materials. As a result, we currently expect house cost inflation exclusive of land costs of 6% to 8% for 2022. More than ever, there are a lot of moving pieces, so we'll update our gross margin guidance if needed as we move through the year. For the fourth quarter, our reported SG&A expense of $344 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues includes a net pre-tax benefit of $23 million from adjustments to insurance- related reserves recorded in the fourth quarter. Exclusive of this benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $367 million or 8.7% of home sale revenues. In the comparable prior year period, our reported SG&A expense was $280 million or 9.1% of wholesale revenues, excluding a $16 million net pre-tax benefit from adjustments to insurance related reserves recorded in last year's fourth quarter, our adjusted SG&A expense was $296 million or 9.7% of home sale revenues. Looking at 2022 overheads, we currently expect SG&A expense in the first quarter to be in the range of 10.7% to 10.9%, which would be flat to down slightly from last year. For the full year, we expect SG&A expense to decrease as a percentage of revenues to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.5% of home sale revenues as we realize incremental overhead leverage on the business. In the fourth quarter, our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $55 million. Prior year reported pre-tax income of $43 million included a $22 million pre-tax charge for adjustments to our mortgage origination reserves. During the fourth quarter, financial services pre-tax income was driven by increased loan production consistent with the growth in our homebuilding operations, offset by lower profitability per loan resulting from a more competitive market condition. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 85%, which is down slightly from last year's 86%. Our reported tax expense for the fourth quarter was $193 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 22.5%. Taxes in the fourth quarter included a tax benefit of $9 million, resulting from deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period. For 2022, we expect our tax rate to increase to 25%, driven by changes in certain underlying state tax rates and the fact that legislation to extend the energy tax credits beyond 2021 has not been passed. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $663 million or $2.61 per share and adjusted net income of $637 million or $2.51 per share. Prior year fourth quarter reported net income was $438 million or $1.62 per share with adjusted net income of $415 million or $1.53 per share. PulteGroup's earnings per share continue to benefit from our share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million common shares at a total cost of $283 million or an average price of $50.11 per share. For all of 2021, we repurchased 17.7 million shares, driving a 6% reduction in our shares outstanding at an average cost of $50.80 per share. For the year, we returned $897 million to shareholders through share repurchases, plus an additional $148 million of dividends. This brings the five-year total of share repurchases and dividends to approximately $3.2 billion. Having reduced our common shares outstanding by more than one-third over the past eight years, returning funds to shareholders has been a significant part of our capital allocation strategy. We fully expect such systematic repurchases to continue in the future, so we're extremely pleased with the Board -- announced today, approving a $1 billion increase to our repurchase authorization. At the end of 2021, we had $458 million remaining on the existing programs. Given our improving financial results and cash flows even after returning over $1 billion to shareholders, investing over $4 billion in our business, paying down $726 million of bonds during the year. We ended the year with $1.8 billion of cash. Our debt-to-total capital ratio at year-end was 21.3%, which is a decrease of 820 basis points from last year. Adjusting for the cash on our balance sheet, our net debt to capital ratio was 2.5%. As part of our overall capital allocation strategy, we have routinely talked about maintaining our gross debt-to-capital ratio in the range of 30% to 40%. As noted in today's press release, we are updating these numbers to better reflect how our business operates today. Over the past several years, we have driven material and sustained gains in our operating performance and capital efficiency. These, in turn, have dramatically increased the cash flows we expect to generate. Taken in combination, we now believe we can grow our business and fund its operations while maintaining our gross debt-to-capital ratio in the range of 20% to 30%. This represents confirmation that the changes we've driven in the business continue to support long-term growth. To further demonstrate this point, in the fourth quarter, we invested $1.4 billion of land acquisition and development. This brings our total land spend for 2021 to $4.2 billion. On paper, this is an increase of almost 50% over 2020 land spend. But I would remind you that we suspended land investment for almost six months when the pandemic first hit in 2020, so some of the 2021 spend was simply deferred for the prior year. We currently expect to increase our land investment in 2022 to between $4.5 billion and $5 billion. Given the vast majority of land we acquire is undeveloped, more than half of our spend in 2022 will be from the development of existing land assets. Supported by the higher land spend, we ended 2021 with 228,000 lots under control, of which 109,000 were owned and 119,000 were controlled through options. On a year-over-year basis, we ended 2021 with an incremental 30,000 lots under auction and remain focused on advancing our land life strategy going forward. I would note that included within our land position are approximately 1,400 lots that were approved under our strategic relationship with Invitation Homes and that we remain on track with our five-year plan of building 7,500 homes under this program with first closings expected in 2023. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. For a number of reasons, we remain constructive on the outlook for the housing industry. Earlier, I spoke about the large demographic trends, which are aligned to support buyer demand over the long-term. In the near-term, most economic indicators point to an ongoing expansion of the US economy, which should keep the job market strong and increase wages even further. We recognize that COVID and its various mutations are obviously a wildcard, but we hope that this latest surge may have already peaked and that conditions will begin to improve going forward. The impacts from COVID that don't appear to be waning are the desire for single-family living and the ability to work from home indefinitely. We are certainly mindful of rising interest rates and the potential risk through affordability and overall demand and are prepared to respond appropriately should conditions change. Still, given a strong economy, high employment and rising wages, this is a market environment in which we can sell homes. Before opening the call to questions, I do want to highlight an initiative that we've launched internally in 2020, but which you may begin hearing more about this year. Called our Hope to Home program, this is our effort to make available for sale more affordable housing and the possibility of homeownership to individuals who might not otherwise get the chance. We all know the benefits that homeownership can afford people over time, but we also can appreciate that not everyone has the same opportunity to access this path. We are beginning to pilot Hope to Home in a few communities and believe it's a program that could ultimately result in the sale of a couple of hundred homes a year. Hope to Home is a for-sale program designed to complement, but run independently of our highly successful build-to-honor program through which we donate mortgage-free homes to wounded veterans. Started in 2013, I'm extremely proud to say that Build to Honor will award its 75th mortgage-free home later this year. Now let me close as I begin by thanking our entire organization, as well as our suppliers and trade partners. You continue to prove yourselves to be an outstanding group of people focused on serving our customers and supporting each other. Jim Zeumer : Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Rob, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started with Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Nice results. Thanks for taking my questions. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Mike. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Hi, Mike. Mike Dahl : First question, just on the gross margin guide. It's great to see it up that much for the full year. It looks like it's up, but it's relatively stable through the year. Can you talk about some of the moving pieces? I mean, obviously, you've had some good sequential pricing. You talked about the full year for cost inflation. But can you talk about the moving pieces throughout the year that keep that guidance a little bit flatter through the year and maybe there's a difference in inflation per se versus second half however you want to kind of frame that? Ryan Marshall : Sure, Mike. Obviously, inflation is real. And maybe principal among that interestingly is lumber, which had trended down we're getting a little bit of a tailwind in the first half of the year, but pricing has moved right back up. And so that's influenced the back half of the year. But I would tell you, you heard in the prepared remarks, we're projecting 6% to 8% increase in input costs for the house, plus kind of every new lot comes with a little bit more expensive cost than the ones that we just costed off, which is consistent with what you've seen for a couple of years now in a rising market, as we bring new assets to market, they're a little bit more expensive. So all those things factor in. The good news is that, as we look at the year, we do see margins improving through the year. So in the prepared remarks highlighted, we'll be at the lower end of the range in the first quarter and towards the higher end of the range. So despite those cost pressures, we think we're getting enough price to offset some of those increases. And margins at 28% to 29% -- 28.5%, 29% are pretty stout. Mike Dahl : Sure. Okay. Thanks. Second question is around cash flow and capital allocation. I mean, it's nice to see the new details this morning. I guess, if we take into account your land investment, it will be up a little, but clearly your guide around income drivers are also up year-on-year. So, it seems like all is equal, cash from ops or free cash flow will be higher in 2022 than 2021. Since you're already in that 20% range or the lower end of that 20% range on gross debt to cap, should we think about effectively all of cash flow in the immediate term is going to be given back to shareholders via buybacks and dividends? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Mike, it's an interesting question. And the simple answer is I don't think so. We've long said that we've got sort of a priority cadence, invest in the business, pay our dividend, return excess to shareholders. And there are a lot of things that we could do with that money. So, I wouldn't want to say it would be restricted to any one thing. The land market, if it's attractive, you could see us investing. We've always told folks we look at M&A, so some money could end up there. So, the good news is, and you've heard this from us before, we're in a position where we have choices to make. You can see with the amount of money that we used to buy back stock in this quarter at $283 million, that's a step up from what we had done, brought the full year to almost $1 billion. The Board increased the authorization by $1 billion. We put that out this morning. So, if you add that to the $400 plus million we had at the end of the year, we've got a lot of capacity there, but we'll look at everything. And so, I wouldn't want to pigeonhole ourselves in the same, yet, it's all going back to shareholders. We'll use the same screen we always do in the business, it is going to be our primary driver as long as we can see an opportunity for higher return off of it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Ivy Zelman : Thank you, and congratulations on a great year, guys. Ryan Marshall : Thanks Ivy. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks Ivy. Ivy Zelman : Maybe, Ryan, you can help us a little bit just appreciating what you just said about with each asset you deliver, slightly higher costs. When you think about pre-COVID and your underwriting land, what are you underwriting in terms of absorption? And what are you underwriting what you're buying at, let's say, today, that might not deliver until 2023, 2024? Just to give us some perspective relative to the normal trend line. Let's start there. Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Ivy, thanks for the question. And I would tell you that I think one of the things that has enabled us to deliver the results that we're delivering is a very consistent land underwriting screen that candidly hasn't changed through time. We're certainly underwriting at current market conditions, and we kind of have to do that in order to remain competitive. So the absorptions that we're underwriting communities at today are certainly a little bit higher than probably what we were underwriting land acquisitions at, say, three years ago. That being said, we're cognizant of the fact that absorptions over the last 12 to 15 months have been slightly higher than normal. And as I think some have said from time to time, trees don't grow to the sky. So we wouldn't necessarily expect that to continue in perpetuity. The thing that I would highlight, Ivy, is some of the things I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We think some of the structural changes that have occurred in buyer preferences for single-family living and perpetual work from home will continue to benefit this industry. We're also not in an oversupply environment and given some of the supply chain challenges that we've highlighted, we don't anticipate that changing anytime in the near future either. And then probably what I'd conclude on, the most important thing that I think we've structurally done as an organization is to integrate more optionality into our land pipeline. We're at north of 52% and over 119,000 lots that are controlled via option, which I think gives us tremendous flexibility, should there be a change in market conditions. Ivy Zelman : No, that's really helpful. And maybe, Bob, in the future you can send us and follow-up sort of absorptions historically. I know we've embedded our data. But with mix shift, it's I don't know that it's a little bit higher, Ryan. Our market conditions right now are back to absorption per community just for the public companies is back to where it was during the great financial boom peak on a trend line basis, and that's even with restricting sales. But the cost inflation in land has been substantial. So maybe you can give us some perspective on how much of land that you're acquiring today, undeveloped draw land relative to what maybe you were thinking about from a baseline in 2019? And what are you paying if you are on finished lots, even if you're optioning, what is the outlook cost embedded in those acquisitions? And I'm done and thank you. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Ivy, that's a hard question to answer kind of apples-to-apples. I mean no two parcels are the same. Certainly, the market is pretty efficient. And as Ryan laid out for you, we are -- it's a competitive market, so we have to be competitive. So we make our bids and pricing based on what we see in terms of pricing that we can see in the market. What we think our cost to construct is and the ultimate return we can generate from the asset, and you're going to see different price appreciation in land in different parts of the country and for different buyer groups, honestly. So all those things would make it really challenging to blanket, say, pricing is up x percent. Suffice to say it is up. And it's one of the reasons I highlighted in that as part of our margin guide. Hopefully, that answers your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Your line is open. Anthony Pettinari : Hi, good morning. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Good morning. Anthony Pettinari : I was wondering if you could talk about kind of credit metrics for your average buyer or your buyer types in terms of FICO or LTV. And then I think you indicated that rising rates you haven't really seen an impact to date? But I'm just wondering, as you look at previous hiking cycles, what you would anticipate in terms of behavior between your different buyer types or trading down market or maybe to more affordable offerings? Any comments you give? Ryan Marshall : Sure, Anthony. Good morning. Thanks for the question. The credit metrics out of -- we obviously have visibility to the credit metrics as a whole from loans that are running through our mortgage operation. And they've largely remained unchanged for the last probably decade. The FICO scores that we see are north of 750. So incredibly strong credit. The loan-to-value ratio is very, very strong as well. So I think the credit metrics we're seeing from the buyers would indicate and maybe reiterate the financial strength that I think we've seen of personal balance sheet. So not a huge concern there, honestly. Bob, anything you'd add on any of the credit metrics that we've seen at this point? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Only that interestingly enough, even among our first-time buyers, if you look at them relative to the kind of the broader universe, we've got a higher mix of FICO scores even there. So interestingly, in a rising rate environment, history as a guide, the people we're selling to have that slightly higher price point have a little bit healthier balance sheet that folks that are just at the edge of qualifying. Ryan Marshall : As far as rising rates go, Anthony, in our prepared remarks, we highlighted that we have not seen it impact demand, and I think a large part of that is because we've been restricting sales and because demand is outstripping supply. We are closely monitoring the impact of further increases in the 30-year mortgage and what that will ultimately do to affordability, but as we've said for a number of years, and we'll continue to talk about it, we do believe that, history as a guide, housing can be strong in a rising rate environment as long as the broader economy continues to show strength, which it is. We\u2019ve got historically low unemployment. We're seeing some real wage growth -- and I think those are -- and consumer confidence remains high. Those are things that I think will continue to prove -- will bode well for the industry, even against a backdrop of slightly higher rates. That being said, even with some increases in the 30-year mortgage, they're going to remain at historically really, really low rates, which we think is encouraging. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then in your comments, I think you stated you're not expecting supply chain size to ease over the course of the year. You talked about lumber. Can you talk about any other categories that are, I don't know, maybe getting worse versus getting better? And then there was a comment on potentially warehousing certain building products. And to the extent that you can, I don't know if you can talk about sort of the magnitude of that or what that looks like? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. Anthony, we don't actually anticipate things to get better through 2022. So we've assumed that we'll continue to have a shortage of what we want in totality. And most of that's coming through either delays or allocations that we and frankly, the entire industry has been given from, from certain key supplies. I think there are some real bottlenecks in manpower availability due to COVID, so some of the factories that our supplies come out of are running at less than full capacity because of manpower issues. We're seeing less availability in terms of transportation in truck drivers. There was a shortage there to begin with, and then you factor in COVID, and that's just further exacerbated. And that -- those domino effects, I think we see flow through the entire supply chain. We are seeing some green shoots, and we have, over the last six months, kind of gone through some peaks and valleys where one particular supply seems to start getting better and lead times shorten only for things to go back to where they were. And so it's for that reason that we're not anticipating that we completely turned the corner and have a fixed supply chain in 2022. Just in terms of the items that we're seeing challenges with; roof trusses, appliances, sighting, paint to a certain degree. So things are pretty critical for us to build and deliver homes, cabinets is another one that I would tell you all the cabinets come out of factories where they've been challenged by historic high demand and manpower issues. So those are a few comments on the supply chain side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to go back to an earlier question around those -- I believe was trying to get around triangulating normalized gross margins, let's say, as you continue to buy land and to the extent that you're not going to have 10%, 15%, 20% home price appreciation over the next few years. If you look back into like 2017, 2018, you were doing 23% to 24% gross margins, which was at the higher end of our -- of the broader homebuilding sector. To the extent that home price appreciation normalizes, could you see a scenario over the next two to three years where given your current underwriting, you could get back of levels, which again, would still extensively be -- if there is a mean reversion, I would assume, still be at the higher level of the broader sector, or is there anything that's changed in how you're either approaching land, your own cost structure with greater scale or some of the improvements, et cetera, perhaps on the construction efforts that you're embarking upon that you could see kind of a slightly -- even slightly higher gross margin trend over time? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. Hey, Mike, it's Ryan, good morning. Thanks for the question. I think I'd go back a decade ago when we really laid out a thesis around making investments to drive industry leading returns. And so I think the way you have seen us make investments in land, the way that we've managed debt, the way that we've allocated capital to share repurchases and dividends that has -- and frankly, the way that we've completely restructured our land ownership structure with so much being toward options, that's all been aimed at delivering top quartile, top tier returns. Margins are certainly a component of that, and it's long been part of our strategy to have leading margins. The thing that I would highlight, Mike, is that we're at 28.5% to 29% gross margins through the rest of 2022, which, as Bob highlighted, is pretty stout. And we're not giving any visibility beyond 2022, I think it\u2019s little early for that. But what you have seen from us is continuously a high and top-tier return on invested capital, and that's going to continue to be our focus. So what that yield in just this past year, we just finished with ROEs that are north of 28%. So we think the operating model that we have, Mike, can work in multiple market cycles. This one happens to be certainly particularly good. Michael Rehaut : Great. No, thank you for that, Ryan. I guess, secondly, just wanted to focus in on the community count growth. A nice trajectory that you've laid out for 2022. Based on the land book that you have, how should we think about community count growth and obviously, past 2022 and obviously not trying to get too granular and beyond what you're prepared to say in terms of formal guidance. But further this has been an area where, as I'm sure you know, people have expressed concerns around some of the growth on the community count side. Are we kind of turning a corner here where we could see perhaps a little bit more consistent growth going forward in this metric? Any thoughts around where we would go past the 870 at the end of 2022 would be pretty helpful for people? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, I appreciate the question. It's Bob. We're not going to give you a guide for 2023. We did want to give a level of granularity more than we have for 2022 to show the sequencing that shows growth each quarter sequentially and ultimately, to a higher point at the end of the year. And in our prepared remarks, I actually said based on spending, we expect that to continue. Like every year, we'll give you a guide for 2023 as we approach 2023. Ryan Marshall : Mike, the only thing I'd add into that is I think if you look at the trend of our land spend over the last three years, we've been a consistent investor in our land portfolio. And with 225,000 lots under control, those all turn into active communities. So we're pleased with what's coming into the pipeline. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is open. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, everybody. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Carl. Carl Reichardt : One for you, Ryan. Hey, just on pricing strategy headed into the spring, I mean you got more demand than you can serve, costs are going up, but rates could come up and we know there's going to be more competition across the board from other builders and you've got more specs. So are you approaching pricing this spring, would you say, more conservatively than you have in past springs? And I know it's not necessarily a corporate and in Atlanta type of decision, perhaps it's more local. But maybe you can talk a little bit about how you're thinking about pricing strategy given the crosscurrent? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Carl, it is more than local. It's probably hyper-local. All of our pricing decisions are made on a community-by-community basis. But that's a company philosophy. We've got very regimented pricing discipline in the way that we break down what the competitive set is, both from a resale and a new environment, both what's on the ground as well as what we see coming into the pipeline over the next six to 12 months. So I think the tools, the methodology, the proprietary pricing algorithms that we have, we think it served us very well, and we've gotten very good results from that. I think, Carl, we always try to be prudent in what we do and never get too far over our skis. I think, the industry has seen over the years, if you push things too far, the consumer will be pretty quick to tell you that you've gone too far and it will shut down. So in the face of potentially some more inventory coming online with some higher rates, we're going to continue to run our playbook, but take into consideration all the data that's available. Carl Reichardt : All right. Thank you, Ryan. And then, just a follow up on Ivy's question. If you look at the homes you plan to deliver in 2022, I'm assuming that effectively none of them are on lots that you bought post, say, the middle of 2020, so post pandemic land. When would you start to see the majority of your delivery volume be delivered on land you bought post pandemic or contracted for post-pandemic? Ryan Marshall : Well, Carl, we're basically turning the majority of the land that we're buying. We're turning in about three years. So -- or when we buy it, we essentially are putting under contract about three years' worth of land. So a-third of that year one, a-third of that year two, a-third of that year three, so you've always got old land cycling out and new land cycling in. So there's never a time when you're going to have a complete fall off the cliff of the entire land book and a whole new land book comes on. There's always a mixing going on. Development timelines are elongated relative to historical as well. So land that -- from the time that we buy it, it's taken us 12 months, plus or minus, to get it fully developed and ready to start selling homes. So Carl, I think the simplest way that I can tell you is that, we always have new stuff coming in, we always have old stuff going out, and all that is factored into the guide that we've given certainly for 2022. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much guys. Really impressive results, and I know folks are excited about the guide, but I actually wanted to explore a few areas where it seems to me like your guidance could actually be incorporating a nice healthy dose of conservatism. And it's really around ASP volume and the implications of volume on margin. So if you look at your ASP, you guided, I think, for the full year, around 515. Your order ASP has been running at around 556, I think, for the past two quarters. Maybe I'm wrong on that, but just if that's the case, 515 seems kind of low for a closings number, ASP number. And then regarding your volume, I think you said 31,000 closings. And I know the cycle times is an issue out there, but it looks to me like you started over 34,000 in fiscal 2021 and even 8,200-or-so in fourth quarter. So although you're guiding as if there's no improvement in cycle time coming, it would seem that your actual -- what you're doing on the ground and what you did in terms of starts is leaving open the possibility that they will get better. Otherwise, I don't think you would have started that many in 4Q. And then if I'm right, that closings could actually do better than your guidance, won't you have some benefit on SG&A and scrambling cost? So that's like the general framework of my question. Let me ask this SG&A question specifically. If you do better than your guidance on closings, what is the incremental SG&A we should apply to those incremental revenues? Ryan Marshall : Stephen, good morning. Thanks for the question. I think all of these things are related. So I'll do my best to kind of tie them together, and I'll ask for probably a little help from Bob at some point. In terms of ASP, Stephen, we've consciously been starting more spec. Most of the spec that we're starting is in our lower priced communities, specifically in our Centex first-time buyer communities where those price points are significantly lower. They will -- those will sell as specs later in the cycle, and so that's all been factored into the ASP guide that we've given. To your point about orders being at a higher price point over the last couple of quarters, that's largely been because we've been selling more of our Del Webb and our Pulte branded communities that come at a higher price point. So it's a fair question you've asked. I understand why you've asked it, but I think we factored in what we see are what we would expect to be our ultimate brand mix as we move throughout the year. In terms of the closing guide, Stephen, and what we started, as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we've factored in what we've started, and we're very pleased with how much inventory have been able to put into the ground, both for sale and spec inventory. We've updated our delivery guide based on our current cycle time and what we anticipate to happen throughout the year with the supply chain. So I wouldn't probably go down the path of assuming that there's conservatism in that guide. I can tell you that if 2022 is anything like 2021, it was the hardest year of homebuilding that we've ever seen as an organization. And so we're going to stand firm on the 31,000 units that we've guided to. If things can improve, we'll all be thrilled. Stephen Kim : For sure. Bob, what about that incremental SG&A ratio that we should be thinking about? And then just my only other question long term is your land supply in years. At some point, the pandemic will hopefully fade and I'm thinking five years out here, three, four, five years out, what level of land, what's the lower bound, lower range of years of land owned that Pulte can operate at? Is it like two years, because some of your competitors are running that low or approaching low? Could that be a level that you guys get to eventually once things have normalized in three to five years down the road? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Stephen, I think we've talked about the SG&A question before. And honestly, if you were to toggle the volume, which we wouldn't suggest, it is a -- look if we are -- if you're increasing volume, it is accretive to our overhead efficiency. I wouldn't want to put a percentage because it depends on how much volume you're talking about. But certainly, we would if we had more volume levers up the central overheads. Your selling costs don't change as a result of more volume. And then in terms of land supply, we've been consistent, honestly, since Ryan became the CEO that we're targeting three years owned, three years option. If you use a trailing 12-month volume, we're a little bit rich on that. If you look forward, it's more in line. It's hard to say where ultimately optionality could go. I think we would love to see it become a bigger part of our business as long as we can do it in a way that, for us, creates value, and that is, a, to be economically workable; and b, create true market risk. You won't see us creating optionality just to do optionality. So we will be seeking market -- some level of market protection from that, i.e., we can transaction if something changes. Again, I think very consistent from us, whether the developer base can get big enough to support a lower level of year's supply for us, time will tell. Certainly, if you look back over the last 40 or 50 years, there were points where the developers were active enough that the builders could take lots on it on a just-in-time basis, that developer base has not reestablished itself since the downturn in 2007, 2008 and 2009. If that happens, I think you'd see us participating. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from UBS. Your line is open. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. First one, maybe starting at a high level. We've been hearing that demand and foot traffic may have actually inflected positively in January. Just curious if that's consistent with what you guys have seen? Ryan Marshall : Yes, it is, John. We're seeing really strong interest from buyers, and we think it's driven by some of the things we highlighted the desire from -- for a single-family living and the work from home trends continue. I would highlight not all the traffics on foot. I think our digital selling tools have probably advanced seven, eight years over the last 18 months, which I think is overall good for the business. John Lovallo : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe drilling down just on the West region, in particular, deliveries declined slightly year-over-year versus pretty big gains in most other regions. Was this just a timing-related issue or is there something else to be thinking about there? Ryan Marshall : Yes. It's really just community turnover, nothing to note, honestly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. Just I had a couple of follow-ups from prior questions. But on some of the materials and labor supply chain challenges and what it means to cycle times? I'm just hoping to get some clarity. By the end of 2021, call it, November, December, have you actually started to see cycle times stabilize? And the reason I'm asking is outside of the recent flare with Omicron, what we've been hearing that builders largely become more efficient in working with the whack-a-mole environment and some had stabilized cycle times? Ryan Marshall : Well, Truman, I think like any game, if you play it long enough, you certainly get better at it. And whack-a-mole is no different, but its still whack-a-mole for sure. What we've seen in our business, we've actually been able to take -- we've actually seen increased cycle times in the front half of the overall production cycle through kind of frame and windows stage, which has been really related to trust availability, framing labor, some of those kind of things and windows, candidly. We've been able to make up some time in the back half of the schedule. So there have been some pushes and pulls. But overall, it's been a net increase to cycle time. We've assumed that, that doesn't get any better in 2022, and that's all been factored into the guide that we've given. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, you all have mentioned some improvement in your new home inventory in 2022, recognizing all the constraints. But -- in this market, today, orders are really a function of inventory and production capabilities in my mind. I'm hoping that you might be able to give us an update on your expectations for starts in the first quarter? And whether or not your first quarter orders could inflect positive year-over-year on a pretty challenging comp based on your internal inventory capabilities? : Yeah, Truman, we don't guide or haven't guided on either one of those. And so probably, I'll stop short of giving you any additional insight. We do feel very good about what we have in the production pipeline. And I think we've demonstrated, really over the last nine months, a very predictable start cadence where we have been able to get volume into the ground, just taking longer for it to move through the overall production cycle. But again, that's been factored into our deliveries -- delivery guide for the year. The last thing that I'd really highlight on that note, Truman, is that, we\u2019ve got -- I think I said in my prepared -- well, I know I said in my prepared remarks, we've got double the amount of spec inventory. So it's something north of about 4,000 units, and that will certainly benefit us as we move through 2022. Operator : And we have reached our allotted time for questions. Mr. Zeumer, I turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Rob. Appreciate everybody's time this morning. We'll certainly be available over the course of the day for additional questions. Have a good rest of your day, and look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Thanks, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Abby. Good morning. Thanks, everyone, for participating in today\u2019s call to discuss PulteGroup\u2019s first quarter earnings for the period ended May 31, 2022. Q1 represents another quarter of strong financial results and has gotten the year off to a great start for us. I am joined on today\u2019s call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior VP of Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning\u2019s presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of this call later today. Please note that as part of this morning\u2019s call, we will review our prior year results as reported and as adjusted to exclude the impact of a $61 million pretax charge associated with the bond tender and a $10 million pretax insurance benefit recorded in the period. A reconciliation of prior year adjusted results and reported financial results is included in this morning\u2019s release and within today\u2019s webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance. I also want to alert everyone that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. As Bob will detail shortly, PulteGroup delivered outstanding first quarter financial results with year-over-year growth of 18% home sale revenues and 43% in adjusted earnings per share. The significant increase in our Q1 earnings per share reflects gains in a number of areas, including higher selling prices, expanded gross margins, increased overhead leverage and our active share repurchase program. PulteGroup\u2019s first quarter financial results are just the most recent in a string of strong quarters that have raised our return on equity to 29.4% for the trailing 12 months. There is a lot for investors to be excited about in terms of the company\u2019s operating and financial performance. Taking a step back from the specifics of our Q1 financial results, I think, it\u2019s fair to say that, the supply/demand dynamics of the first quarter were consistent with the trends the industry has been experiencing for the past year or more. In short, demand was strong, available inventory was scarce and the incoming supply is limited. Let me take a minute to expand on these thoughts. On the demand side, consumer interest in purchasing a new home remained high throughout the quarter. With few exceptions, demand was strong across all the price points, buyer groups and markets that we serve. The U.S. housing market continues to benefit from favorable demographics, a strong economy, an outstanding job market and a rising wage environment. New home sales are also benefiting from ongoing and significant increases in rental rates for single and multifamily dwellings. According to John Burns Real Estate Consulting, their numbers indicate that rental prices for single-family homes increased by upwards of 5% in 2021, while multifamily lease rates were up by approximately 13% over the prior year. Forecast point to further increases in 2022. Even with today\u2019s higher prices and rising rates, owning a home can still make clear economic sense for many consumers. Not only can homebuyers get a comparable or even lower monthly payment, but that payment is more stable over time. Given this demand strength in the first quarter, we were able to raise prices in effectively all of our communities with sequential price increases in the range of 1% to 5% common across the country. In addition to the fundamental strength in homebuyer demand, home price appreciation is benefiting from a lack of available inventory in both new and resale. Similar to buying a new car these days, people who are shopping for a home understand how competitive the market is. This brings me to the supply side of the equation. As demonstrated by our first quarter results, our teams did an outstanding job advancing our homes through the construction process and even surpassed the high end of our closing guidance. I want to recognize the efforts of our homebuilding operations to manage through the constraints and the availability of people and materials that are impacting everything from land entitlement and development to home construction. Depending on the specific market, the availability of labor and materials has at best remain the same, but in certain areas conditions have gotten a little worse and build cycles have gotten longer. Given these challenging conditions, our production time lines extended by about one week in the first quarter and now stand at 145 days to 150 days in most of our divisions. With only a couple of days remaining in April, unless dynamics change dramatically in the next couple of weeks, which does not look likely any improvement in the supply chain would provide a more meaningful benefit to 2023 production. Bob\u2019s comments will include us reaffirming our guide for expected 2022 deliveries of 31,000 homes and I would highlight that this guidance assumes that the availability of labor and materials does not change for better or worse. With our production cycles remaining extended, we continue to tightly control sales in most of our communities across the country. We appreciate these restrictions can be frustrating for consumers, but it is the right strategic decisions given overall conditions. From both the customer experience and a business risk perspective, it doesn\u2019t make sense to extend our backlog out a year or more just to record another sign up. Even with all of these challenges, I want to highlight that we started almost 9,000 homes in the first quarter and that we now have approximately 5,200 spec homes in production. The majority of these homes are in the initial start and framing stages, but we would expect these houses to deliver in the back half of 2022. As we have noted on prior calls, our spec production is largely focused in our entry level communities. In sum, I think it\u2019s fair to say that housing demand remains strong, home prices continue to rise and the supply of new construction homes coming to market is constrained. That being said, the Federal Reserve has been very clear in signaling that interest rates are going higher as they seek to control inflation that has hit 40-year highs. There are a lot of favorable market dynamics that can support ongoing buyer demand in the face of higher rates, but the Fed is intent on slowing down the economy and this certainly has the potential to impact the housing industry. Given this dynamic, it makes sense for us to take actions to position our business for continued success. For now, this means focusing on our land acquisition practices. Internally, we are committed to increasing our option lot position and have set a goal of having 65% to 70% of our future land pipeline controlled under option. Our disciplined land investment process helped us to place some great land positions under control over the past several years and we will be closing on -- that we will be closing on in 2022. Going forward, we will continue our thoughtful approach to investing in the business and we will be prepared to make adjustments in response to changing market conditions. We certainly expect that our land teams can continue to identify tremendous land opportunities, but we want to make sure that only the best projects ultimately get approved. Now let me turn over to Bob for additional comments on our first quarter. Bob? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. As Ryan highlighted, the year has gotten off to an excellent start as home sale revenues in the first quarter were up 18% over last year to $3.1 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven by an 18% increase in average sales price to $508,000, while closings of 6,039 homes were consistent with last year. The higher ASP for the period was driven by double-digit gains in pricing within our first-time move-up and active adult fire groups. By buyer group, our mix of closings for the first quarter was also consistent with last year, as we made -- we remain well balanced across the primary buyer groups. In the quarter, 35% of buyers were first time, 40% were move-up and 25% were active adult. In the comparable prior year period, the breakdown was 33% first-time, 44%, move-up and 23%, active adult. In the first quarter, we recorded net new orders of 7,971 homes, which is down 19% from last year. Lower orders for the quarter were primarily the 7% decrease in community count, combined with the impact of aggressively controlling sales paces, given ongoing disruptions in the supply chain. As has been the case for the past several quarters, we continue to restrict sales in many communities in order to align sales with current production pace. Looking more closely at our order activity, orders to first-time buyers decreased 13% to 2,710 homes, while orders to move up buyers were lower by 22% to 3,341 homes and active adult orders declined 23% to 1,920 homes. The relative outperformance among first-time buyers is due to the availability of the spec production we started in the back half of 2021 that supported some incremental orders. Between delays in municipal approvals and extended land development time lines, it is taking longer for some communities to open for sale. As a result, in addition to being down from the prior year, our first quarter average community count of 777 was slightly below our previous guidance. We expect the modest drag in the community openings that we experienced in the first quarter to continue for the remainder of the year. As such, we now expect that our average community count in the second quarter will be 780, with growth to 800 in the third quarter and 830 in the fourth quarter. Reflective of the strength -- strong demand conditions we experienced in the quarter, our cancellation rate remained exceptionally low at 9%. In total, we ended the first quarter with a unit backlog of 19,935 homes, which is an increase of 5% over last year. The dollar value of our backlog increased 31% to $11.5 billion, which reflects the 5% unit growth combined with a significant year-over-year increase in our ASP and backlog. As Ryan noted, our teams are doing a great job moving homes through the production cycle in light of the challenges the industry is facing and the availability of labor and materials. As a result, we ended the first quarter with 21,269 homes under construction, which is an increase of 44% over last year. This production number includes 5,181 spec homes that are currently in the pipeline, which is almost triple our spec units at this time last year. At quarter end, specs were 24% of units under production as we continue to make steady progress toward our goal of 25% to 30%. Our overall production pipeline is still early in the construction process as 28% of these homes are at the initial start stage with 43% of the homes at the framing stage. We ended the quarter with only 64 finished specs, which is consistent with our comments that homes made available for sale sell quickly. Based on the universe of homes in production, as well as their stage of construction, we currently expect to deliver between 7,200 and 7,600 homes in the second quarter. Again, assuming no significant improvement or erosion in the availability of labor and/or materials, we still expect to deliver 31,000 homes for the year, which would be an increase of 7% over last year. On our prior earnings call, we noted that, given supply constraints and limited opportunity to meaningfully increase construction pace, we would rely on price as the bigger lever to maximize return. Looking at the dollar value of our backlog and new orders, you can see that this is what has occurred. Based on the average price in backlog and the mix of homes we expect to deliver, we expect our second quarter closings to have an ASP in the range of $525,000 to $535,000. Inclusive of the $508,000 average sales price realized in Q1 and the first-time spec homes we expect to deliver in the back half of the year, we now expect our average sales price for the full year to also be in the range of $525,000 to $535,000. As we always highlight, the final mix of deliveries can influence the average sales price we realized in any given quarter. Given the ongoing strong demand conditions, we have been able to increase sales prices sufficiently to offset rising costs and to further expand our gross margin. In the first quarter, homebuilding gross margin was 29%, which is an increase of 350 basis points over the first quarter of last year and is up 220 basis points sequentially. In addition to the strong demand and pricing environment, our Q1 deliveries also benefited from the flow-through of lower cost lumber, as prices for wood products rolled over in the back half of last year. Until a recent pullback, lumber prices had moved significantly higher since the beginning of the year, which will impact our closings in the back half of this year. Beyond lumber, we are continuing to see meaningful inflation in most materials and labor costs. As such, even with the recent pullback in lumber, we expect house cost inflation exclusive of land cost to be in the range of 10% to 12% for the full year. Based on the strength of recent selling conditions and despite the volatility in the materials and labor market, we now expect our gross margin to be in the range of 29.5% to 30% for each of the remaining three quarters of the year. Given the timing and impact of lumber and other input costs, we expect to be towards the higher end of this range in Q2, but likely toward the end -- lower end of the range in the third and fourth quarters. As always, there are a lot of moving pieces, so we will update you on our gross margin guidance if needed as we move through the year. Our SG&A expense in the first quarter was $329 million or 10.7% of home sale revenues, which is in line with our earlier guidance. In the comparable prior year period, our reported SG&A expense of $272 million or 10.5% of home sale revenues included a pretax insurance benefit of $10 million. Exclusive of that benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $282 million or 10.9% of home sale revenues. Given expected homebuilding revenues for the coming quarters, we currently expect SG&A expense in the second quarter to be in the range of 9.4% to 9.6%, which would be a 30-basis-point improvement over the prior year at the midpoint. For the full year, we now expect SG&A expense to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. First quarter pretax income for our financial services operations was $41 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $66 million. Lower pretax income for the current period is reflective of a much more competitive market conditions which negatively impacted our capture rate and overall profitability per loan. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 81%, down from 88% last year. Our reported tax expense for the first quarter was $145 million for an effective tax rate of 24.2%. Our effective tax rate in the period was lower than our recent guidance. We recorded benefits related to equity compensation in the quarter. Looking ahead, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 25% in each quarter over the balance of the year. Our reported net income for the first quarter was $454 million or $1.83 per share. In the comparable prior year period, our reported net income was $304 million or $1.13 per share, while adjusted net income was $343 million or $1.28 per share. In the first quarter, the company repurchased 10.3 million common shares or approximately 4% of the shares outstanding at the end of 2021 at an average price of $48.59. Relative to the first quarter of last year, our share count is down by almost 10%. In addition to allocating $500 million to share repurchases in the first quarter, we invested $1.1 billion of land acquisition and development. This keeps us on track to achieve our prior guidance of $4.5 billion to $5 billion of land spend for the full year, with more than 50% of that spend being for development of existing land assets. Inclusive of our first quarter spend, we ended the quarter with approximately 235,000 lots under control, of which 52% were held under option. Our strong land pipeline provides us with the lot need to grow our business, while allowing us to focus future investment on projects that meet our underwriting standards. Even after allocating approximately $1.6 billion to investment in the business and share repurchases, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 21.5%. It\u2019s worth mentioning here that as highlighted in this morning\u2019s earnings release, Moody\u2019s Investors Service recently noted the strength of our operations and overall financial position when they upgraded PulteGroup\u2019s senior unsecured ratings from Baa2 -- to Baa2 from Baa3. As Ryan discussed, given the Federal Reserve comments that we were in for a period of rising rates, we are acutely focused on ways to mitigate land related risk. In recent years, we have established a land pipeline that can support the ongoing growth of our operations, but provides optionality should demand conditions change in the future. Going forward, we will continue to emphasize the use of lot options or comparable structures to control rather than own positions and we are actively working to increase our percentage of option lots within our land portfolio. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. We realized continued strong buyer demand in the first quarter and buyer interest has remained high through April. That being said, a 200-basis-point increase in mortgage rates since the start of the year is likely to have an impact on consumers. Even with the potential for changes in demand, I think the limited supply of available homes means prices can remain high and puts the construction industry in an advantageous position to weather future demand volatility. As we sit here today, the bigger challenge by far isn\u2019t getting houses sold, but rather getting them built. That said, it is important that we take actions now to put PulteGroup in the best possible position for continued success. Based on recent field visits and walking numerous job sites, I can personally tell you that our teams are doing an amazing job getting our homes constructed. I want to thank our entire organization for their efforts and I have to highlight the work of our corporate and field-based procurement teams, sourcing even the most basic materials can change from week-to-week, but this group has learned to adapt and find solutions to the most challenging situations. Before opening the call to questions, I would also like to highlight that PulteGroup was again ranked among the 100 Best Companies to Work for by Great Place to Work and Fortune Magazine. We didn\u2019t just rank again this year but jumped up 32 positions to number 43 on the list. Being ranked is certainly a nice acknowledgment, but much more important is actually having an amazing and supportive culture that makes PulteGroup a place where people want to be. This is an important competitive advantage when working to attract and retain the most talented individuals. Now let me turn the call back to Jim. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thanks, Ryan. We are now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Abby, if you will explain the process, we will get started. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Ashley Kim : Hi. This is Ashley Kim on for Matt today. Thanks for all the colors. So, just my first question, understanding that you kind of saw order strength across the business, but just wondering if there\u2019s any reason to think that those communities are specifically thinking entry level buyers may begin to see greater challenges given where rates are going? Ryan Marshall : Well, actually, I think, it\u2019s a fair question. As we highlighted in our prepared remarks, the demand that we saw in the first quarter was exceptionally strong and that\u2019s continued into April. To your point, if there is a buyer group that will be more impacted by rising rates, it\u2019s certainly the first-time buyer. For -- it\u2019s for that reason, among others that we have maintained the importance of our diversified and balanced consumer strategy. We have about 35% of our business that\u2019s specifically targeted to entry level. We do tend to play at the higher price points within the entry-level consumer group. So I think it gives us some room to move around. The other piece that we have done here to help with the kind of buying process is most of those homes were starting to specs and we are not releasing them for sale until they are closer to the delivery window, which I think shortens the amount of time that a buyer will be waiting to take delivery of their home in our backlog. Ashley Kim : Thanks for that. And then have you done any recent stress tests on your backlog to kind of see what the potential risk there as your buyers kind of sit in backlog for a while to lock in rates? Ryan Marshall : We have -- actually, Bob, will give you a little color on that. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. I think we are always obviously in close contact with our backlog. We have seen people taking a longer rate lock position and so we have highlighted that an increase in rates is a single-digit -- 100-basis-point rate increases a single-digit, perhaps, impact on our backlog. It\u2019s interesting, most of the folks that are there have significant equity built up in their house and so they have expressed that they want to close. And so we have lots of different ways that we can help people get there, whether it\u2019s to source additional income, if they have some additional down payment different programs. So the backlog is pretty solid, and obviously, people have changed in circumstances we work with them as best we can to try to get them to closing table. Ashley Kim : Thanks for that and good luck on the quarter. Operator : We will take our next question from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and nice quarter. Ryan Marshall : Thank you. Alan Ratner : So, I guess, a lot we could drill on it. Maybe first just kind of talk a little bit about the land portfolio. Obviously you guys are making an effort there option share higher. If I look at your lot count today, about 235,000 lots, that\u2019s up about 50,000, 60,000 from the end of 2020, and I guess, you have delivered probably 30,000, 35,000 lots over that timeframe or homes over that timeframe as well. So is the right way to think about it that agnostic to the option and own split that roughly 90,000, 100,000, so maybe 40% of your portfolio has been kind of contracted or tied up for over the last 18 months -- 15 months, 18 months or I know there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces there. So I am trying to figure out maybe if you can provide some color on the vintage of your portfolio of land and how much actually has been tied up as of late? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. Alan, it\u2019s -- I think a way to think about it is pre- and post-pandemic, just to be simple and we would tell you that half of it is pre and half of its post. Obviously, we put things under control, oftentimes a fair amount of time in advance of when we actually take the lots down and so owned versus option plays into that. On balance, it\u2019s usually taken us 12 months to 24 months to get from contract to getting communities open. So I don\u2019t know if that gets you there, but roughly 50% is pre-pandemic or two years to three years ago. Ryan Marshall : [Inaudible] Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. Alan Ratner : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And that was, I guess, pretty close to the numbers I was getting to there. So I guess when you think about the land market today and the move towards off-balance sheet and what\u2019s going on in the industry in general. Have you seen any led up over the last few months and the competitiveness of the land market? What\u2019s the inflation rate running at across your portfolio right now? And what\u2019s the outlook going forward, I mean, do you think that some of these deals might get re-traded if things do soften a little bit or is there just so much embedded kind of margin profit in them right now that kind of what\u2019s spoken for is likely going to move forward? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. Alan, it\u2019s Ryan. I would tell you the land market remains competitive. Certainly, we have other new homebuilders that are buying for the prime parcels and there\u2019s other options as well, might it be apartments or other types of users for the land. So I think if you have got a well-located parcel of land, it\u2019s competitive, always has been, I think, always likely will be. In terms of kind of what we have seen with more recent optionality. We have pushed from two years ago or three years ago where we were kind of in the 30%s, 30% range in terms of amount of options. Today, we sit at 52%. As you have heard, we are going to push that higher, we have kind of set a goal and a target for ourselves to be in the 65% to 70% range. In terms of your question about, is there potential for things to be re-traded. We are purchasing this year, Alan, I would tell you there\u2019s likely no need for that. To your point, there\u2019s a lot of embedded value. These are parcels that were put under contract or under control 18 months to 24 months ago and so, they are great deals and we are going to close on them. We are going to be really thoughtful and judicious around what we are underwriting. What we are putting under control now that will be closings in 2023 and 2024. Those are the parcels that, I think, are more susceptible to being tighter in terms of economics that meet our standards and it\u2019s part of the reason that we think it\u2019s so important that you have got optionality in your land portfolio because it gives you the flexibility to maneuver. Alan Ratner : That\u2019s great. I appreciate the color there. And if I could sneak in one just housekeeping question, do you have the share of your orders this quarter that be considered kind of non-primary buyers thinking single-family rental, investors/like homeowners. I am not sure if you track that, but any disclosure you can give there and the trend would be great? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. It\u2019s pretty consistent with history at about 3% to 5%, Alan. Alan Ratner : Great. All right. And that includes the SFR business that you have been involved with? Bob O'Shaughnessy: We don\u2019t have much of that at this point. Those closings are coming next year. Alan Ratner : Okay. Perfect. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ryan, thanks for the balanced commentary. I wanted to press on the strategy of restricting sales a little bit, because I think we are all synthetic to the supply chain issues, and obviously, recent quarters, been very clear that, that\u2019s the right thing to do, but this is a pretty dynamic and rapidly evolving market, especially with rates. You seem to be acknowledging being a little bit more guarded around what may or may not happen with demand at least in the near-term. And so why is it still the strategy to be so restrictive on sales versus, say, you get the buyers signed up, get them into backlog and then be able to work with them on extended rate locks or things like that could give a little bit more certainty and visibility? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. Mike, it\u2019s a great question. I think the biggest reason is inflation. We are in a hyperinflationary environment for all things in the world. And as we had -- as we mentioned in some of our prepared remarks to go out and put another buyer in backlog that\u2019s not going to be able to close on their home for another year, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great experience for anybody. The consumer doesn\u2019t want to wait that long. They are susceptible to all kinds of potential fluctuations in interest rates, which they may or may not be able to handle. And then we have locked in our economics in terms of what we are charging the consumer at the point that we sign the contract. And then we are exposed to a year plus of potential moves in commodity inflation and we just don\u2019t think that makes sense for our customer and their experience and it certainly doesn\u2019t make sense for economics. So we really like the way the production environment moving. We started almost 9,000 homes in the quarter, which I think demonstrates that we are getting units in the ground. We were able to close homes that were at the high end of our guide, which I think also demonstrates the fact that we are -- we have got pretty good control and predictability around what\u2019s in production and so we are actively moving through bringing our backlog down to a level where we can start to release more things for sale and we are certainly looking forward to that. Mike Dahl : Got it. And just as a follow-up to the last one. As you make that progress, I mean, how do you envision the year playing out in terms of the restrictions and your ability to lift those. And then as kind of follow-on to the first one, but if I could add a second different question. Just anything you are seeing around upgrades, options, things that might be more leading edge in terms of highlighting some new buyer sensitivities? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. Mike, we don\u2019t -- I think as you are aware, we don\u2019t guide to new orders. So we will stop short of doing that on this call. We are seeing some minor wins in the supply chain and we are having pretty good luck getting homes in the ground. The first quarter is still a quarter where you deal with a fair amount of weather. So to get 9,000 new starts, I think, demonstrates that the supply -- that our production pipeline has moved. So I think it\u2019s fair to assume if we can continue at that rate, that you will start to see some restrictions lifted on the way we are releasing lots and releasing homes for potential sale over the balance of the year. We are reaffirming our guide or we did reaffirm our guide of 31,000 closings for the year and that assumes that the kind of supply chain environment kind of stays about like it is right now. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. And to your question on option and lot premium spend. It was almost $100,000 a unit in the most -- in this print. That\u2019s up 23%, which I think reflects the strength of the market. And you can -- we don\u2019t provide that level of detail on our -- on the orders we have taken, but you can see from the average sales prices being up, we are not seeing much change on that at all. Mike Dahl : Okay. Great. Thanks, Ryan. Thanks, Bob. Ryan Marshall : Yeah. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Mike Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but wanted to dial in a little bit in terms of intra-quarter trends and I know sometimes you are reticent to get into month to month. But as you have seen, obviously, a tremendous move in rates during the quarter, I was curious if you witnessed any change in terms of either cancellation rates month-to-month or any change in the marketplace, let\u2019s say, not just you, but with regards to incentives or discounts or even rate of price increases that have occurred? Ryan Marshall : Hey, Mike. Good morning. This is Ryan. Good question. And the sales pace throughout the quarter was incredibly consistent, because we were controlling it. So we set a rate that we were willing to sell at and so you saw a very similar performance January to February, February to March. Ordinarily, you would actually, I think, in a -- given it\u2019s the spring selling season, you would see sales orders build through the quarter and we just didn\u2019t let that this year. Discounts are non-existent. We were less than 1% in the quarter, which is down from where it was in the same quarter last year. And price increases remained on a fairly consistent predictable cadence with what we have been over the past six months to nine months. So I think the short answer is, the market is still healthy, demand is still strong, there are more buyers out there than we are able to build homes for right now. Mike Rehaut : Great. Great. Thanks for that. Secondly, just a question on the planned increase to lot option, I was wondering whether or not that\u2019s going to be driven by predominantly just by simply an increase in option lots going forward and perhaps keeping the owned lots flat. You did see your own lots go up, looks like about, I want to say, roughly 15% or so over the last few quarters, wondering if that might reverse even. And with a significantly higher level of lot optioning, if the, with the cash flow generation or reduced cash requirements of running a business like that, how that might change your repurchase or other uses of capital? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. Mike, I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate on actual owned lots at any one point in time. I think we are trying to grow the business to do that. You have to have lots on the ground. You have to develop them. Some of it will depend on whether we are buying raw that we are self-developing or if we have arrangements that provide us finished lots. So there\u2019s a lot of things that will influence that. In terms of what that does ultimately to our capital allocation, I think, you have seen us, as we have driven that option percentage higher, we have been generating a significant amount of cash and we have been using that cash to continue to invest in the business and to buy back stock. You saw that we obviously bought back a lot of stock this quarter. Our lens on that doesn\u2019t change, right? So, if we have excess capital and if that\u2019s being generated by a more efficient balance sheet, we will evaluate the needs for that capital and one of those is going to be share repurchases. So I think at the end of the day, it does a couple of things for us. One, it provides us some flexibility and protection from market risk. It yields higher returns and it yields higher free cash that we would use, again, consistently with what we have done over the past 10 years. Mike Rehaut : Great. Thanks so much guys. Appreciate it. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Mike. Operator : We will take our next question from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America. Rafe Jadrosich : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First I just wanted to ask, compared to prior periods of rising mortgage rates, how quickly would you have seen an impact and then how does that compare to how homebuyers have responded with this most recent spike in rates? Ryan Marshall : Well, I think, it\u2019s difficult to compare periods of rising rates, because of the factors that are driving those rising rates are so different. And we happen to be in an inflationary environment with an economy that is continuing to run pretty hot. We are seeing real wage growth. We are seeing a low unemployment environment and there\u2019s a real shortage of supply. So there -- the other thing that I think its work highlighting, in this rate environment is the impact of the pandemic and so I think trying to compare to rising rate environment, well, I am sure, you can do it. I think the conclusion will drop will likely not be terrible informative. Rafe Jadrosich : Okay. That makes sense. And then, can you just give a little more color on the serve initiatives there shift more towards lot of option, do you have sort of time line for the shift to the 65% to 70%? And then, can you just talk about willingness and ability to work with land developers and bankers to shift more towards option contract? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. So it will take some time. It will be probably the next two plus years that you will see us progressively move there. But history is guide, I think, when we have laid targets like this out for our operating team. And frankly, we shared it with the investment community we have executive against it. We certainly think that we do that here as well, which give us the reason that gives us that we have got confidence to kind of put that target out there. I think it\u2019s very doable. There are number of ways in which will effectuate moving from where we sit today to higher level of optionality, some of that will done with directly with the land sellers. We think that\u2019s arguably the best way to do it. Sometimes we will work with development partners that are actually putting finished lots on the ground for us and there are some other alternative arrangements that you can use to get optionality in the land book as well. So I think you should expect us to probably use a mix of all of those things as we move to more optionality. We think it\u2019s got a lot of benefits in terms of managing risk. But certainly very capital efficient, it helps to drive returns to a better place and we will use that in cash flow for some of the things that Bob highlighted a minute ago, including share repurchases. Rafe Jadrosich : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Truman Patterson : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow-up on that prior question with you all targeting more option land over the next couple of years, I am just hoping, if you look at today maybe versus six months ago, regarding land bankers or landowners, developers that you are optioning from. Have you seen any change in terms of the deals, deposits, interest costs, et cetera or even any sort of change in their appetite to continue doing deals? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. Truman, I don\u2019t -- not really, right? I mean, the market, I think, is pretty efficient. We have not seen a reduction in desire. So if we are talking to folks, there is money available. The question for us has always been, can we make the economics make sense and you have seen things tighten a little bit, which is good. For us, again, the goal is to try and create a transaction that yields us an acceptable return and gives us some flexibility and I don\u2019t think that the market has changed appreciably. We are trying to broaden relationships. We are talking to different folks. We still probably start at if it\u2019s a land seller trying to work out a deal with them first. What we are really doing now is saying, okay, if they are not willing to do some sort of option, does it make sense to put a third party between us and the dirt before we close. More to come on that to Ryan\u2019s point. It will take some time. But we are working through it. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Bob, I believe earlier you mentioned that there\u2019s been some increase in buyer interest and extended rate locks. I am just hoping to understand, have you all proactively gone to the buyers in your back and encourage them to lock, are you introducing rate lock programs? And in a similar light, are you all increasing either deposit escrow requirements given the current market strength in the face of rising rates? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. To the latter one, we always seek a fair deposit and we are continuing to do that today. In terms of working with our consumers, we still enjoy a very robust capture rate. We do offer. We think attractive rate lock programs. We have seen people go out a little bit longer. They are locking a little bit earlier. And we are encouraging them to do that, because the rate environment is going to move, it seems and has moved against them. So we have seen, in particular, the sort of the 60-day rate lock environment, which is when people are getting closing dates typically. We have seen a lot of people participating in that. Truman Patterson : Okay. Got you. But not too much longer than 60 days? Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. That goes to the individual, candidly. We offer it. We have got long rate locks. But it gets expensive, Truman. So they are\u2026 Truman Patterson : Okay. Bob O'Shaughnessy: \u2026 great for the consumer. Truman Patterson : All right. Thank you and good luck in the upcoming year. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Truman. Operator : We will take our next question from John Lovallo with UBS. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. The first one, it sounds like with your community count expectations over the next few quarters and in your current spec production we could see a nice reacceleration in orders in the back half, so just curious your thoughts on that? And then along the lines, the outlook doesn\u2019t seem to include or incorporate any improvement in labor room materials. But if we take a step back, just curious what your view is on that, I mean, how do you assess the probability that we could see some improvement in those areas in the back half and if we could see some potential ramp in production? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. John, good morning. Thanks for the question. On the community count side, we are dragging a little bit from where we would optimally have liked to have been and it\u2019s mostly around entitlement delays with municipalities. It\u2019s always been hard and it\u2019s taken a long time to get through the entitlement process. I would tell you, cities and city councils and planning and zoning boards, while I think most are back and working, it\u2019s just simply taking longer. So really nothing there that I would highlight other than it\u2019s taken us a few months longer than ideal. In terms of kind of the supply environment, we are operating under the assumption that things are going to continue to remain hard for the balance of 2022, which means we are -- that\u2019s why we have reaffirmed the guide that we gave. I will take you back to the commentary that we gave at the end of Q4, our assumption was that 2022 is going to remain a very difficult supply chain year and we are still there. As I highlighted in my prepared remarks, John, if we are to see some improvement and I\u2019d like optimistically, I think, we have got to start turning the corner soon. That\u2019s mostly going to benefit our 2023 production. We are clearly not there yet in terms of kind of giving guidance. And then, finally, in terms of kind of new orders and more communities and less sales restrictions. I think that all can be interpreted as a positive for the future. But we don\u2019t give forward guidance in terms of orders. So we will -- while we are optimistic, we will report the news when we get there. John Lovallo : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Ryan. And then just lastly, on the sequential price increases of 1% to 5%, can you just remind us, how does that compare to the last couple of quarters? Ryan Marshall : It\u2019s very similar. Not a lot of change. It was a strong quarter and pretty similar to what we saw in Q3 and Q4 of last year. John Lovallo : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Yeah. Thanks a lot, guys. My observation is that investors are just really struggling to understand how in the face of such higher rates, the demand is still holding up. And Ryan, I thought you did a good job of clarifying that, it\u2019s really just that the supply is so constrained that the demand can come down, but it will still be greater demand than supply. So just to push on that a little bit more and to clarify, when you talk about rate locks, which is something that we have been hearing builders talk a lot more about in recent days, I just want to confirm that the orders that you are taking and that you have taken, let\u2019s say, over the last month, forgetting about the closings, but the orders, those buyers are -- but today\u2019s buyers are qualifying at today\u2019s rate and if they are locking, they are basically at today\u2019s rate. So there\u2019s nothing about the orders today that reflects an obsolete rate environment. I just wanted to have you confirm that for us? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. Stephen, that\u2019s exactly right. Buyers that are purchasing today or purchased in the first quarter, we qualified them at the rate when they applied for a mortgage. It\u2019s part of the reason that Bob touched on, the comment that we made about stress testing our backlog, those buyers would have qualified at whatever rate was there in a prior period. And largely, those buyers are still able to qualify and for the ones that are maybe a little tighter. We have got programs and things that we can do to help get them over the hump. But to your question, Stephen, and I think the most important thing is, yeah, the buyers that are signing up today are qualifying in today\u2019s rate environment. And the reason that they are locking or doing longer rate locks is because they are making the trade between the cost of that forward longer term rate lock against the volatility that they think might play out in the interest rate environment. Stephen Kim : Yeah. I totally get that and I think that\u2019s super important, because we have been getting some people some conversation, where I think people got a little confused about that. So thanks for clarifying. The second question relates also on the rate situation in incentives. So one of the things that I have been wondering about is that, as you have seen the rates move up and you have seen cycle times extended. In many cases, you might have a situation over the next, let\u2019s say, a couple of quarters where you have buyers who rate lock expired or they didn\u2019t rate lock and the home is closing later than it ordinarily would have exposing them to a higher rate when they close. And so I am wondering, does your -- it sounds like today, rate locks and things like that are being borne by the buyer. But when it comes to the closing table, does your gross margin guidance assume that there may be some increase in sort of last minute incentives, like maybe a rate buy down or something due to this sort of unusual circumstance or is that -- and is that something you envisioned? Just trying to get a sense for how that might be factored or might be an issue as we go forward and to what degree it\u2019s been contemplated in your gross margin guidance? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. Stephen, there are certainly kind of one-off scenarios where we have to work through some kind of a challenging situation with the consumer. We pride ourselves on outstanding customer experience and doing the right thing for the consumer, which by and large, I think, we do always. The buyers that are in backlog have got tremendous backlog -- tremendous equity built up based on when they purchased. They are excited to close and so there\u2019s not really a need for a lot of negotiation at the closing table. They want to be in their homes. They have got tremendous value built up. They are closing. So the -- the gross margin guide that we have given incorporates all of the information that we have, and kind of what we would expect to play out over the coming quarters and the balance of the year and it\u2019s a healthy gross margin, as I think, you can probably appreciate. Stephen Kim : Oh! Yeah. Absolutely. Well, great. Thanks for the help. Just one observation, your comment when you said about half of your land is pre-pandemic. If -- just making sure that, that\u2019s half of your controlled land, which means that basically all of your owned lots, the effective equivalent of all of your owned lots are pre-pandemic. It\u2019s because about -- you have about half of your lots controlled, which are also owned, right, actually a little less than that, right? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. Stephen, that\u2019s fair. Stephen Kim : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa Raghavan : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. There\u2019s a lot of talk on supply chain constrain, how it\u2019s getting better, in fact, a week elongated. But even with all of this, your closings came in above your high end of guide. I am curious was there anything that particularly drove the beat, like did you find additional resources quicker than expected, maybe had better work around or was just maybe things like Omicron or weather were just not as bad as you anticipated when you originally guided? Ryan Marshall : Well, look, we are slightly on the high end and so high end of our guide, which we are thrilled with. I think it\u2019s more a testament to the strength of our operations team, our construction team that really work incredibly hard to deliver homes in a tough environment and it\u2019s hard out there. I think we have done a better job based on being in this environment now for a year, probably, going on almost two years that we have probably got better forecasting methodologies and assuming how and how quickly things are going to move through the cycle. But it continues to be tough out there, but that\u2019s not taking anything away from our construction team that I think really knocked it out of the park. Deepa Raghavan : No. That\u2019s fair. So, yeah, it was good execution. No doubt. But I was just curious if the guide was set a little conservatively to begin with. Anyways, my follow-up is on, again, supply chain issues, but more categories based. Is any of your categories like active levels versus first-time buyer experiencing any tougher supply chain issues versus the other, just given that some products maybe perhaps unique to some categories or is it similar level of constraints? And also, should we -- if and when we go into a market slowdown near-term, can you talk through which of these categories you think you can take the most share in? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : And to your first question on are there particular supplies? No. I think it\u2019s consistent across buyer groups and it\u2019s kind of the same commodities, the same items that continue to see constrained things that involve microchips are hard to come by. There are some commodities, some lumber components that are difficult for sure. So, but in terms of differences between buyer groups, I wouldn\u2019t highlight anything. As for kind of are there consumer segments where we could take share. I would tell you, we are looking to grow our company across the Board. Our mix of business today is exactly where we want it positioned and so as we look to grow the company, we will look to do it equally across all consumer segments. I\u2019d highlight that our Del Webb brand remains the most recognized and powerful brand within the active Adult Consumer Group. And so we like what we are able to do there. Similarly, we like the gains that we have made in the entry level consumer space with our Centex product, which that product is mostly being sold or started as a spec home and sold just prior to the home being finished. Deepa Raghavan : Thanks very much. Good luck. I will pass it on. Operator : We will take our next question from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Deepa actually asked one of my questions, so I just have one. I wanted to ask how traffic trended during the quarter and into April. And then how much does it matter? If interest lists are heavy relative to what you can use and you are using best and final offer pricing more frequently and more Internet marketing, is traffic still the leading indicator of sales that we have all used to think it has been. I am just interested in your perspective on that and that\u2019s all I got. Thanks, guys. Ryan Marshall : Yeah. Carl, I think, to your point, traffic is not as good an indicator of the strength of the market as maybe what it used to be. Most of our communities don\u2019t have available inventory that you can buy off the lot, so to speak. So some of the things that we are really paying attention to today is the traffic to our website, virtual visits, in addition to the customers that actually come into the stores or the model parks physically. So it\u2019s important, trust me, we pay attention to it, it\u2019s something that I watch on a weekly basis, what\u2019s going on with our traffic. But it is a little bit different right now compared to how it used to be. The difference maybe between now and pre-pandemic is the virtual traffic, which is ridiculously strong compared to maybe a prior cycle. Carl Reichardt : And how was walk-in over the course of the quarter, Ryan, and into April? Ryan Marshall : I don\u2019t have those numbers. Does that walk-in, Carl, you were asking... Carl Reichardt : Walk-in. Walk-in. Just what we consider old school traffic, let\u2019s say. Bob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. It\u2019s interesting, because of everything Ryan just said, that is relative to pre-pandemic good, but declining a little bit and mostly because I think people know there\u2019s no inventory to look at. So they are not coming into the stores often but they are still searching for homes and literally and figuratively. Many places have such limited lot releases that there\u2019s not anything to go look at. Carl Reichardt : Okay. Thank you, Bob. Appreciate it. Thanks, Ryan. Ryan Marshall : Yeah. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Mr. Zeumer, I will turn the call back over to you. Jim Zeumer : Great. Appreciate it. Thank you, Abby. Appreciate everybody\u2019s time today. We are certainly available for questions as we go through the remainder of the day and we will look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Chris and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Inc. Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Thank you, Jim Zeumer, you may begin. James Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Chris and good morning. I appreciate everyone joining today to review -- our PulteGroup conference call to review our second quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2022. Joining me to discuss PulteGroup's strong second quarter are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides had accompanied today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post an audio replay of this call later today. I want to highlight that in addition to reviewing our reported Q2 results, we will also be reviewing adjusted results for the second quarter of last year. Adjusted results exclude the impact of a $46 million pre-tax insurance benefit, as well as a tax benefit of $12 million resulting from a change in valuation allowances associated with state net operating loss carryforwards. A reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financials included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance. As always, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Ryan, Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim and good morning. As you read in this morning's press release, PulteGroup delivered another quarter of exceptional and in many cases record setting financial results. Led by price appreciation and a 430 basis point expansion in gross margin, our second quarter earnings of $2.73 per share increased by 44% and 59% respectively over last year's reported and adjusted earnings per share. Our strong earnings performance helped to further reduce our debt-to-capital ratio to below 21% while raising our return on equity for the trailing 12 months to north of 30%. We've talked in the past about wanting to deliver high returns over the housing cycle and building the financial strength to safely navigate changing market conditions. I'm proud to say that we're accomplishing both. I would also note that consistent with our stated plans, we continue to return funds to shareholders having repurchased an additional 3% of our shares during the quarter. As we approach the 10 year anniversary of reinstating our share repurchase program, I think it's worth noting that we have reduced our share count from roughly 387 million shares at the end of 2012 to the current 233 million shares, a decrease of almost 40%. Bob will detail the rest of the quarterly numbers. So let me spend some time reviewing the demand dynamics we experienced during the quarter. Between National Housing Data and Wall Street analysts surveys, I suspect my comments may only serve to reaffirm your understanding of the changing market conditions. It is clear that the 200 basis point increase in interest rates over the past several months finally caught up with consumers. After two years of meaningful home price appreciation, the jump in mortgage rates created sticker shock and pushed affordability out of reach for some first-time buyers. At the same time rising inflation, falling consumer confidence and the drumbeat of a possible recession caused some buyers, some move-up buyers to hit the pause button. As for our active adult consumers, the drop in the stock market combined with the overall uncertainty has created some to slow their home search process as they wait for conditions to settle down. While demand has slowed, it is by no means stopped as we continue to work with buyers to sell homes at the right price where consumers see value, they remain engaged in the home buying process. Consumers who are in the market right now were obviously accepting of and making decisions based on current mortgage rates. What we are experiencing with these customers is that given the volatility in mortgage rates, a higher percentage of these buyers are interested in spec homes that can close in the coming 30 to 60 or even 90 days, rather than building to order. Given the shorter time to close, buyers are using their own funds or available incentives to lock in a mortgage rate or buy the rate down to an acceptable level. In other words, during this period of rate volatility, some buyers are willing to trade the opportunity to personalize the home for greater financial certainty. Reinforcing this point, I can tell you that the majority of incentives in the second quarter took the form of longer-term rate locks or rate buydowns. Many of today's homebuyers can still afford the price of a new home. But some need a little help on the rate or want the mortgage rate certainty for a home that will close later in the year. After 18 months of exceptional demand, we entered the second quarter with only 64 finished specs. And while we have successfully increased spec production to our historic range of 25% to 30% of units, we had a limited supply of quick move in homes available. We have taken actions to improve our inventory position and now have specs that have advanced in the build process and will be available to sell and close in the third and fourth quarters of this year. During this period of interest rate volatility, our strategy is to start specs consistent with buyer demand. As market conditions evolve, we are prepared to continue starting specs, reemphasize build-to-order homes or slow starts entirely as demand conditions warrant. The Fed has been clear in articulating their intention to fight inflation through higher rates and we recognize the housing market has been and will continue to be impacted by these actions. Well, consumers are being understandably cautious, people still desire homeownership. Aging Millennials still need homes and there remains a long-term deficit in U.S. housing stock after years of under building. Let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our second quarter results, Bob? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan and good morning. Following on Ryan's comments, our second quarter financial results demonstrate both the continuation of positive trends as well as some of the newer challenges which are impacting the market. In the second quarter, PulteGroup's home sale revenues totaled $3.8 billion, an increase of 18% over the prior-year. Higher homebuilding revenues in the second quarter were driven by a 19% or $83,000 increase in average sales price to $531,000. Given our construction cycle times, the increase in average selling prices primarily reflects strong demand and pricing conditions across all buyer groups in the back half of last year. In the quarter, we closed 7,177 homes, which is down less than 1% from last year and a few units below our guide. While the overall production environment remains generally challenging, the shortfall in deliveries is primarily attributable to a specific supplier issue that impacted our Florida markets. More broadly, I think it's fair to say that the supply chain remains challenging. While we are seeing areas of improvement, I would use the word fragile to describe overall conditions. Between limited inventory in the system and bottlenecks in distribution, any disruption in production or shipping can set back construction by a couple of days or weeks. In fact during the second quarter, our overall cycle times extended by another two weeks. That being said, we are feeling a little more optimistic about supply chain conditions getting better through the back half of the year, allowing us to begin playing back workdays next year. The mix of deliveries in the second quarter continued to align with our started targets with 35% from first-time buyers, 39% for move-up buyers, and 26% from active adult buyers. In the second quarter last year, the mix was 30% first-time, 43% move-up and 27% active adult. We reported 6,418 net new orders in the second quarter, which is a decrease of 23% from the second quarter of last year. The decrease in orders reflects both slower sales pace, and higher cancellations resulting from the significant increase in mortgage rates over the past several months. The slowdown in signups impacted all buyer groups. Although our first-time buyers fared the best with orders up 1% to 2,454 homes. Move up orders were lower by 37% to 2,172 homes and active adult orders decreased 27% to 1,792 homes. On a relative basis, the stronger orders among first-time buyers reflects current buyer preference for spec homes that can close sooner with that less interest rate risk. By design, our spec production has been heavily weighted toward our first-time communities. Our reported orders for the quarter also reflects an increase in cancellations as some consumers were impacted by the change in consumer confidence and today's higher rates. On a unit basis, we had 1,152 contracts cancelled in the second quarter up from 665 cancellations last year. This pushed up our cancellation rate for the period to 15% compared with 7% last year. We always want our homebuyers to complete the transaction and enjoy their new Pulte Home, but when cancellations do occur, we have been able to resell the home. In the second quarter we operated from an average of 791 communities, which is a decrease of 2% from an average of 808 communities last year. After several quarters operating at a year-over-year deficit on communities Q2 ship market and flagship point, as we begin showing growth in our year-over-year community counts. More specifically, in the third and fourth quarters we expect to operate from an average of 800 and 830 communities respectively. Both numbers would be up over the comparable prior year period as we begin realizing the impact of increased land investment over the last several years. We ended the quarter with a backlog of 19,176 homes, which is down 4% from last year. While units are down slightly strong price appreciation over the past year has raised our backlog value by 18% to a record of $11.6 billion. At quarter end we had 23,349 homes under construction, which is an increase of 35% over last year. Consistent with Ryan's earlier comments about buyers seeking to minimize time to close, we have increased spec starts and ended the quarter with 6,789 spec units under production. While we have been successful in increasing the overall number of homes under construction, longer cycle times mean that 70% of these units are at the start or framing stage. As such, we expect deliveries in the third quarter to be in the range of 7,000 to 7,400 homes. While we have the homes in production, given changing market conditions and ongoing supply chain issues, we now expect full-year deliveries to be in the range of 30,000 to 31,000 homes. Based on the anticipated mix of closings. We expect the average closing price of homes in the third quarter and for the full-year to be in the range of 540,000 to $550,000. Supported by a strong price appreciation we have realized over the past few quarters, PulteGroup generated substantial gains in our home building gross margin, which increased 430 basis points over last year to 30.9%. In addition to higher prices, our Q2 gross margins reflects the flow through of lower cost lumber purchased in the back half of last year. As we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, we've experienced meaningful cost inflation for labor and materials in the current year, led by a significant upswing in lumber cost at the start of this year. Although lumber has decreased again, which will impact our 2023 closings, we've continued to experience incremental house cost inflation as the year has progressed. Based on our most recent internal estimates, we now expect house costs for the year to be up 10% to 12% over last year. Despite the ongoing inflation in materials and labor, including the meaningfully higher lumber costs, we are raising our margin guide for the third quarter and now expect to realize gross margins of approximately 30%. At the present time, we are maintaining our prior guide for fourth quarter gross margins to be in the range of 29.5% to 30%. In the second quarter SG&A expense totaled $351 million, or 9.2% of home sale revenues. In the prior year period our recorded SG&A expense of $272 million, or 8.4% of home sale revenues included a $46 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in that period. Excluding that benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense in the second quarter last year was $390 million, or 9.8% of home sale revenues. Based on the number of homes we expect to close in the third and fourth quarters, we are targeting SG&A expense in the third quarter to be in the range of 9.1% to 9.3% of homebuilding revenues. At the midpoint, this would be a roughly 40 basis point improvement over last year. For the full-year we still anticipate SG&A expense to be 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $40 million in the second quarter, which is down from $51 million in the same period last year. The decrease in pre-tax income reflects the extremely competitive market conditions that continue to pressure profitability and capture rate in the business. In the quarter, our capture rate was 78%, down from 86% last year, as we are unwilling to chase market pricing down to unprofitable levels. Our tax expense in the second quarter was $212 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.5%. In the second quarter of last year, our reported tax expense of $136 million, or an effective tax rate of 21.3% included a tax benefit of $12 million, and the benefit of federal energy efficient home credits, which expired as of December 31 last year. Looking at the bottom-line, PulteGroup's reported net income for the second quarter was $652 million, or $2.73 per share. In the prior year, our reported net income was $503 million, or $1.90 per share with adjusted net income for the period of $456 million, or $1.72 per share. In the second quarter, the company continued its active share repurchase program buying back 7.1 million shares for $294 million, or an average price of $41.44 per share. Through the first six months of the year, we have repurchased 17.4 million shares, or 7% of our shares outstanding for $794 million. Throughout the past 10 years, we have taken a fairly systematic approach to our share repurchases. We plan to maintain a routine presence in the market, but given ongoing stock market volatility, we will incorporate more of an opportunistic approach to share repurchases. Over the near term, we believe this strategy allows us to be more responsive to changing market conditions. We ended the quarter with $732 million of cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 20.8%. We continue to see value and the potential to achieve appropriate risk adjusted returns in many of the land assets we put under control over the last couple of years. As such, we invested $470 million in outright land acquisition during the quarter and invested another $655 million in the development of existing land assets, bringing our total land investment for the second quarter to $1.1 billion. We remain constructive on long-term housing demand, but we appreciate that market conditions are in flux. While we always maintain a disciplined approach to land investment, we are assessing the land positions we have under control to make sure that the underwriting assumptions supporting our investment reflect current market conditions, and that the projected returns still achieve our required return thresholds. At this time, we still expect to invest between $4.5 billion and $5 billion in land acquisition and development for the year with more than half of this spend allocated to developing existing land assets. Given today's changing market dynamics, the optionality of our land book becomes an even more important tool for potentially enhancing returns and controlling risks. We ended the second quarter with 243,000 lots under control, of which 54% were controlled through options. And as we highlighted on our last earnings call, we are assessing ways to meaningfully increase our option lot position to a target range of 65%, 70% of our lots under control. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan. Ryan Marshall : The more challenging demand conditions that developed in the quarter have continued through the month of July as the significant increase in mortgage rates has impacted consumers throughout the country. While all consumers are impacted by higher rates, we are seeing differences across our markets. Lower priced markets in places like Florida, Texas, and the Southeast areas of ongoing high end migration are holding up better. Higher priced markets are those which have realized outsized price appreciation in recent years have incurred a more meaningful slowdown and demand. In tech hubs like Austin or in our Western markets in California and Washington were prices routinely approach or exceed a million dollars. Sales bases have slowed as buyers struggle with the combination of elevated prices and increased mortgage rates. Housing is clearly in the sights of the Federal Reserve and its fight against inflation that the Fed desires depending upon the community. Home price appreciation has slowed, stopped or through the use of incentives is taking a couple of steps back. Through much of the second quarter, incentives were mostly tied to the mortgage, but this is now expanding to include discounts and options and lot premiums. In the end these are variations on a path toward lower price, which is what the Fed needs to see as it assesses when they have moved rates high enough. While we are still early in this process, we are starting to see some impact on the cost side commodities like lumber, copper, and aluminum have rollover. The fallen lumber prices alone could save us upwards of $10,000 per home beginning in 2023. And while land prices are notoriously slow to adjust, deals are getting cancelled and/or renegotiated. We walked away from a handful of deals in the second quarter. And as mentioned earlier, we are reassessing all of the land transactions we currently have under control, given ongoing changes in housing demand dynamics. We remain constructive on the long-term outlook for housing demand. But right now, higher mortgage rates were having an impact. We have to work harder to sell homes. We have to be more nimble in the market to make sure we have the right product available. We have to be responsive to changes in the competitive landscape. This is how homebuilding typically operates. And I am extremely confident in PulteGroup's ability to compete. I would highlight that we operate from a position of strength with an outstanding balance sheet, a strong land pipeline, unmatched product quality, and most importantly, experienced and talented people throughout our organization. So let me end by thanking our entire team for their hard work and commitment. James Zeumer : Great. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time in this call. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, one follow-up. Thank you. And Chris, if you would open the lines, we'll get started with Q&A. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open. Matthew Bouley : Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. First one just on the buyer segments, clearly a wide difference there between first-time buyers, move-up and active adult, just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on what's going on there, clearly with first-time buyers, sort of by definition, potentially more financially constrained into this environment. And as you mentioned, more impacted by the move in rates. And yet you have this significant difference between the Buyer segments. So could you sort of just elaborate a little on what you think is going on there? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Matt. Good morning, it's Ryan. The biggest thing I'd highlight here is the availability of quick move in homes in the first-time buyer segment, what we've seen with all buyers is that there's a real preference toward having a home that can deliver in the near-term. I think the uncertainty around supply chain delays and some of those things have certainly proved to be more predictable and better. But the biggest thing is just this the certainty of being able to lock in the interest rate without a whole bunch of incremental rate lock points, and then they've been able to use incentives to buy down the current rate to something that they can make work from a overall affordability standpoint. So I think that's the biggest difference. As we highlighted in some of our prepared remarks, each of the buyer segments or the consumer groups we target have been impacted in the current environment for different reasons. But it's really the availability and quick movements that allowed the first-time segment to outperform. Matthew Bouley : Got it, thank you for that, Ryan. And then second one on the incentives. I think I heard you say at the end, what was initially more related to or the initial incentives being more related to rate buy downs and such now sort of progressing into option and lock premiums coming down. I guess number one, apologies if I didn't hear you, but if you could actually put some numbers or quantify that statement. And number two just as these incentives has progressed, are you actually starting to see any elasticity there? Are you actually starting to see some buyers sort of react positively to those changes in incentives? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes, so it's a good question. Let me maybe start first with the incentive load that we saw with signups. And this is actually new contracts that we wrote in the second quarter. They were in the range of about 2%, which is still below probably what we would consider to be a normal range of 2% to 3% if you went back to pre-COVID timeframes, and that includes all incentives. So incentives on options, mortgage rate type incentives, financing incentives, et cetera. It gets a little harder to quantify the change in lot premiums, because we're always repricing and always re-leasing new lot option or a lot premium pricing as we release new phases. So that becomes a little bit more subjective. But what we highlighted is accurate. We are starting to see not only in our own business, but in the competitive set, some additional incentives that are starting to go beyond just financing related incentives. Matthew Bouley : All right, much appreciated. Thank you very much. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question is from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First, on your build-to-rent strategy, I believe there have been about 1,400 lots approved through the strategic relationship and I think first closings in '23, you all put out initial kind of five year plan, I'm just trying to understand whether those targets are still good. And really whether you've seen any shift and appetite from any of the build-to-rent operators or your partner in particular? Ryan Marshall : Truman, good morning, we're right on target with our kind of five year run of 7,500 units in terms of kind of moving through that in a very programmatic way. So we feel very good about how the partnership is working and the progress that we're making. We've not changed any targets to this point. And candidly based on our performance and discussions with our partner, if anything, I would tell you maybe the appetite could potentially slightly increase as we go into maybe some choppier time. So, no updates from us yet. We like the way the partnership is working, and we plan to continue kind of moving down the path. Truman Patterson : Okay, okay. Thanks for that. And then you all mentioned your -- to an extent updated land strategy. But have you all started to rework any of the option deals now that demand has softened? And are you making any changes to that strategy to get to the targeted 65% to 70% option land, I'm thinking, are you attempting to walk down the number of owned lots extend the takedown timeline of some of the option deals, et cetera? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes Truman, it's a fair question. In terms of strategically, no, we are not changing where we have been for what is essentially a decade now. We still desire optionality, we still start with individual sellers. What we've offered is that in order to get from where we are today 54% in this most recent print to 65% and 70%, we're likely to be looking at more institutional type relationships. That process is underway, we'll give you updates as we make as transactions occur there, we still think that we can move up from 55% into that 65% to 70% range, take a little bit of time. But in terms of how we're approaching it, not at all, in terms of your question, as it relates to our current attitude and negotiating stance, we've said in the prepared remarks, we've always been, I believe pretty disciplined in how we evaluate our land position and negotiate transactions. That hasn't changed and maybe it's even been heightened. We are taking a close look at everything we are closing on. So as an example, if we put a contract, a parcel under control 18 months ago, that was waiting final entitlements, before we take that down, we are revisiting the underwriting that we had when we approve the transaction to make sure that the absorptions and the pricing and our cost structure because vertical construction costs are up, horizontal development costs are up. So we're looking at it holistically does this transaction makes sense? I will tell you, we have walked away from a couple of transactions where for a number of reasons we just didn't think it made sense whether it was locational or economic, we are also trying to make sure that the timing of takedowns makes sense. And so we have had discussions with sellers that said, hey, our original takedown structure was A, B, and C, and we'd like it to be A, D and E now. I think the sellers, I haven't seen a change in value propositions out there. But the ability to work with time is something that does, and we have taken into account. So long story short, hopefully this is really just continuing to be disciplined in the land buying process. And in a choppy market, yes, you're going to see time become more important to us and in some cases, dollars. So we'll proceed further. Truman Patterson : Perfect, thank you guys. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Truman. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Stephen Kim : Yes, thanks very much guys. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on some of the comments you made with respect to market conditions. In particular, I wanted to ask about your assessment of the alternatives that your customers are evaluating. You mentioned that there's a preference respects, they can move into quickly, you said that they're remaining engaged. We know there's not a lot of standing inventory out in the marketplace, either on the new or existing. And we've also begun to hear that some of the other larger public builders have slowed their role a little bit on production. And so bottom line question is, are you seeing that your customers are finding alternatives out in the market or you continuing to find that they are remaining on your interest list and things of that nature? And have you seen anything specific in terms of your competition doing anything particularly disruptive with respect to their production? In other words, have they -- have you seen an increase in production activity? Or have you actually seen the opposite? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, good morning. There was a lot there. So let me see if I can unpack it one at a time, in terms of our competition, we've actually seen competition pull back slightly in terms of the amount of inventory production that they're putting into the market. And that's specifically for some of our competitors that I think are predominantly spec builders. We haven't seen anything that's been irrational, or widespread, irrational disruptive type behavior, when it comes to incentive, or price drops or things of that nature. Of course, there's the anecdotal builder in a specific market, in a specific submarket that might have a unique or particular challenge that they're working against, but we haven't seen anything that that we would highlight at a national level. In terms of the choices and the opportunities that buyers have, I think it's still the market to find homes that are in the right place at the right price, with the timing that matches up to what buyers want. And more than anything, Stephen, what we've tried to kind of highlight. And Bob and I were just out in the market a couple of weeks ago and we were in multiple sales offices in multiple different cities over the course of two or three days. And spec inventory is definitely preferred. And I think it's all about the financial certainty that a buyer can get by being able to lock in the rate without paying a whole bunch of extra discount points, which you have to pay for a longer-term rate lock, or they're able to take the current market rate and put some incentive dollars against that and buy it down, or do a five year arm or a seven year arm or something of that nature. So I think, what we're seeing with buyers, if they can find the home that meets their needs, and they're able to get certainty around the financing. We're seeing buyers move forward. As part of the reason that we highlighted in our prepared remarks that buyers are remaining engaged in the process. We've been very successful in getting our backlog across the finish line for the most part. As we've looked at the reason for cancellations, they're vary like they always have been. There's not surprisingly been a disproportionate change in financing. So we're still able to get buyers across the finish line and qualified in the cases where buyers are canceling. We've been successful in getting those homes resold pretty quickly. So it's a choppy market out there, Stephen. I think we're doing some really nice things, we continue to emphasize quality of the homes that we're building and customer service, buying land in the right locations. And I think over the long-term in a broad housing environment that we're very constructive on. We think over the next year two, three years, we've positioned ourselves to be very successful with our overall strategy. Stephen Kim : Great. That's really helpful. I mean, particularly your comment about the certainty versus the qualifications. It sounds like for a lot of buyers, it's not math, it's mental. And that's encouraging. I wanted to follow-up regarding your commentary about incentives -- excuse me, still being lower than normal. I think you said 2% on new contracts versus normal is as much as three. And that people are preferring these rate lock, or these buy downs. A couple of things, one, we had heard that rate buy downs have gotten even cheaper that used to be typical 4 :1 ratio. And now we've heard ratios as low as like 2.5:1. So I was wondering if you can comment on that, whether that's been benefiting you? And then secondarily, we were -- it was interesting to see that your order price actually was quite strong, again, despite a pretty heavy mix of entry level buyers. And so I'm curious if you could comment on that. Did you actually see order price increase in all three segments or exactly what was going on there that drove the very nice growth in order price this quarter? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, I'll take the first part of that, and I'll let Bob, give you some details on the order pricing. In terms of kind of incentives that are out there, I think all are speaking for ourselves, but I think our competitive set as well. I think we've been, we've worked to be smart in finding kind of where the market is, and what will move the needle for buyers. You mentioned that just a second ago, I think as much as anything, this is mental versus price. And so we've been cautious not just to cut the bottom of the market out from underneath, what I think we've all work so hard to achieve, because that may not ultimately move the fear that's out there in the minds of a lot of buyers, specifically our move up in our active adult buyers. As far as rate buy downs. I'll let Bob, maybe comment on the ratio, we do have currently advertised on our national website, a 4.25% interest rate, which is on a seven year arm or a seven six arm as I think they're now doing. But we think there, we think there are solutions out there, providers that are ready to move forward. And we're not having to completely give away the farm in order to define some of those interest rates that I think are more like what we saw 90 days ago. Bob, do you want to touch on his question on the pricing? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, it's interesting, if you look at our ASP in the most recent print, were up 19% the highest kind of growth of ASP is in the first time space, which was up 24% move up and active adult were up about 20%. And so the 19% growth for the company is mix adjusted, right? If you look at our backlog, what we've seen is to answer your question, pricing up across all three. So our backlog ASPs are higher for all three of our key demographics first time move up and activate bill. Stephen Kim : Bob was that sequential? Is that a sequential comment or it just yours? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: That is versus the first quarter of this year. Stephen Kim : Great. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: And interestingly, the highest increase on a relative basis among those is the move up. Now mix matters and all that, but that move up buyer space is probably the biggest contributor to that increase. Stephen Kim : Okay, thank you so much. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There's still a lot to dig in on here. Ryan, Bob, I know typically you don't give things like monthly trends, but just in light of this being such a unique and quickly changing environment. Wondering if you could quantify your order trends by month and give us a little more quantification on how July is tracking? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, I think we're going to stick with our previous kind of practice and not get into the monthly detail. I will tell you that we did see a decline as we move through the quarter. April, was still relatively strong, May slowed, and then June slowed again, specifically, after the 75 basis point increase that we saw from the Fed last month. We saw a big change in June. And then that's really kind of continued through July. We have seen an uptick in cans, as we've moved kind of through the period as well. I think, again, all kind of related and tied to the kind of buyer's remorse and the fear of maybe potentially buying at the top of the market, as we potentially go into a recessionary type environment. I think that's weighed heavily on buyers. So we're still, I'll just, I'll leave it at that Mike. Michael Dahl : Okay, maybe just quick kind of part two, before I ask the second question. Just if July is still tracking similar, I don't know, if it's similar or worse than June. We have effectively retraced that entire last 75 basis point move up in rate. So just it doesn't seem like we've seen an order trends improve really across the group based on your comments specifically. So wondering if you can kind of reconcile that? But my second question is around land and following-up on some prior questions and your comments around managing strategy and you've always been disciplined. If we look on a forward basis, based on where you're kind of tracking on orders, your lock position might end up at call it like nine to 10 years, if we were using orders as the denominator, which is obviously quite elevated. So how are you thinking about incremental acquisition dollars, or as I think Truman may have asked paring back your own land position more aggressively looking out? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, I appreciate the question on land. Let me just I'll finish your question about kind of what we've seen from buyers as rates have pulled back over the last call it three to four weeks a little bit. So I think that's certainly been helpful. We have seen a slight up tick in our ability to sell and get new deals done, as I think buyers have kind of come to terms with the current environment. But when you combined the higher rates, along with I think the overhang of low consumer confidence, some combination, it's pretty volatile cocktail that I think we're all dealing with and helping the consumer to make what is the single biggest purchase of their lives. So, there's a lot wrapped up in there, we're going to continue to focus on a lot of the basics, we're going to continue to focus on making sure that our community execution is great that we've got the right product that we've got, that were priced competitively, we're not going to find ourselves in a position where we're giving up market share because we're being too margin proud. We're very -- we're obviously very happy with the work that we've done on the margin side. But I do want the investment community and our investors to know that we're going to continue to be very market competitive. Moving to the land side. Mike, there's a couple of things here that I'd highlight. Number one, we continue to be very focused on through cycle investment, and delivering high return on invested capital. So the way that we have allocated capital, the amount of land that we've put under control, the way that we have structured our purchase transactions has all been toward maximizing return, I think we've done an unbelievable job there. As we move into this period of time where demand is clearly slowing, and we've got lower new orders to your point, you could end up with more years owned or more years controlled than what you realistically probably need. We think that's the beauty of the option strategy that we have undertaken over the last number of years. And so we've got two potential options, yes, you can work to trim the owned land position, but you can certainly also trim the option land percentage as well, or as Bob highlighted, we've got the opportunity to renegotiate some of that on time. So, this is a business where you clearly need forward land, we like what we have under control, but we're not blindly rushing into every contract without given everything a second, third and a fourth look to make sure that it still makes sense, based on current market conditions, but also based on our overall land pipeline, and what we think we need to run a profitable high returning business in the future. Bob, anything else you'd add on land or land pipeline? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: No, maybe the only thing I'd add, if you look at our owned lot position, we own 113,000 lots three months ago, that was 112,000. So despite the investments that we've made in the current quarter as an example, it's not like we're bulking up the owned position. To Ryan's point, we've got flexibility with the option, if you look at our quarterly growth in the balance sheet as an example, we put a lot of money on the balance sheet in this quarter, the majority of that was house, which is going to be quick turning for us. So we put $800 plus million into inventory in the quarter, which is reflective of that $1.1 billion that we spent on land and development. But again, a lot of that is house and it's the cycle time extension that we've talked about. And so we'll get that money back pretty quickly. So hear you loud and clear. We have the ability to influence what our owned lot position looks like, based on the strength of the book we have today. Michael Dahl : All right. Thanks, Ryan. Thanks, Bob. Appreciate the color. Operator : The next question is from Alan Ratner with Zelman and Associates. Your line is open. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for commentary and information so far. Bob, maybe on that last point, just talking about the inventory build and primarily the whip build there. I just wanted to clarify your start pay strategy at this point. Ryan, I think your message is loud and clear that you guys are seeing relatively stronger demand on homes that are closer to delivery, which I think makes a lot of sense. At the same time as bill cycles where they are, you guys do kind of need to make a decision on where you potentially see demand going over the next six, nine, 12 months. So have you actually been maintaining that pace of spec starts assuming that that's where the demand will continue going forward or have you started to dial that back a bit from where you were earlier in the year? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan, the pace of spec starts has been dialed back from where we were in the first part of the year, no question, because we've seen -- we've seen demand subside or pullback for to be built, as well as specs. But on a relative basis, there is more ability to get buyers across the finish line, when we've got homes that are within kind of a 30 to 90 day delivery window. So, proportionately we're starting more specs relative to sales compared to historical norms. That's a mouthful there. So on an absolute basis, it's less across the board. On a relative basis, we're doing more specs compared to dirt sales, when you think about historical norms. So, Alan, I think the best way I can describe is we got one foot on the gas and we got one foot on the brake. We are managing this very aggressively. We want to have inventory that is available. The last thing we want to do is put ourselves into the penalty box by having too many finished stocks. Alan Ratner : Okay, that makes sense. And obviously with cancellations normalizing, there's probably some unintentional specs that come out of that as well. And on that point, you mentioned that you're up to this point have been able to resell those cancellations pretty easily. Curious, what's the margin differential been on those resales compared to what you thought the margin was going to be based on the initial sale and backlog versus where it's likely going to settle out at once you deliver the home, now that's going to result? Ryan Marshall : Yes, it's interesting. Alan, the reality is that most of the cancellations are pretty fresh, right. It's usually in the first 30 or 60 days, where either somebody can't get financing or has buyer remorse. And if you look at the body of cancellations that we had in this quarter, we didn't see a big up tick in the number that were financing related, it was more buyer remorse. And so we haven't seen a big change in the margin profile for the folks that were in the backlog for a long time. So they may have signed their contract late in 2021. Honestly, let's say, they just can't get financing for whatever reason. When we're reselling those homes, we actually see higher prices. And again, that's not the majority, because most of the churn is earlier in the backlog. So not a huge differential, because pricing hasn't moved that much in the 30, 60 days since people signed the contract. Alan Ratner : Got it. That makes sense, I appreciate it guys. Thanks a lot. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Alan. Operator : The next question is from John Lovallo with UBS. Your line is open. John Lovallo : Good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Ryan, I think I heard you say something, what I found very interesting, I just want to make sure I heard it correctly. But I think you said that as rates have sort of settled here a bit, that the ability to sell has improved. So I wanted to make sure that I heard that correctly. And I wanted to kind of get your thoughts on you've been through this many times before. Do you see this being a time of a prolonged sort of slowdown? Or do you think that this is something that's kind of more of a pause? And that once rates do settle, I mean, who knows what they're going to sell higher or lower. But once they do finally settle, I mean do you think that we're going to be back sort of on track again? Ryan Marshall : Yes, John, I'm going to probably stop short of trying to prognosticate and forecast what the future will hold. But I will tell you, and we said it in our prepared remarks, we're long-term very constructive on housing. We have a fundamental shortage of housing in this country. And I believe that as the Fed navigates this tricky situation of 40-year record high inflation and all the stimulus money, and supply chain issues, and all the things that have kind of -- that are going into our current economic environment, I do believe that housing will continue to have a very strong run. So -- it's with that mindset that we're running our company, we're making decisions on how we invest, that we're making decisions on how we allocate capital, et cetera. So I think, as we move forward, maybe in the medium term, the combination of affordability and consumer confidence is going to continue to drive kind of what happens with housing. We are seeing incomes go up. So somewhere in the middle of all of that soup, I would like to believe that over the long pole housing continues to be successful. And then, John, I think I missed maybe the first part of your question, remind me what that was? John Lovallo : Sure. Just that I think that you had mentioned, when rates have settled and pulled back here a bit more recently, then your ability to sell has actually improved? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, it probably a little bit of a dead cat bounce, John, I think it was really tough following the last Fed meeting. I think we saw the consumer react quickly. And then as I think the consumer has come to terms with that, as well as we've seen rates actually come down. I think there's been a positive trend in our sales offices. So there's a lot out there as I think we've said, both financially and psychologically, and I think that consumers trying to deal with all those things. John Lovallo : Got you. And then kind of dovetailing off of what Alan asked, I believe, the strategic decision towards more specs to kind of target the first time buyer in the quick moving, makes a lot of sense in this environment. I guess, how far are you guys willing to shift here? And then how quickly could you actually pivot back if we saw some stabilization? Ryan Marshall : Yes, it's not just the first time buyer, will be starting specs across the spectrum. And in terms of pivoting back, it can be quickly that is a decision as, it's really just how many homes we want to start and how much demand there is. So if there is a leveling out of the market, such that demand is pretty consistent, we can pivot back particularly for that move up an active adult buyer, where we think the real value of the build-to-order model is very quickly. John Lovallo : Okay, thank you guys. Ryan Marshall : Yes. Operator : The next question is from Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate you taking my questions. First, I just wanted to circle back to some earlier comments around the increase in incentives, but also kind of highlighting some of the decrease in some of the input costs, you highlighted. Lumber, obviously, where you said maybe 10,000 a home, copper, some other materials. As you think about the increase of specs today, maybe going up, call it a 150 basis points, lumber itself at 10,000 on a 500,000 plus home, that's also perhaps 150 basis points. As you look out, just kind of considering those factors in and of themselves, because obviously, there are a lot of other variables. Does that kind of point to potentially first half gross margins holding 4Q levels or are there other factors that we should be considering as well? Ryan Marshall : Hey, Mike, I think it's too soon for that, honestly. We've obviously given a Q3 margin guide and a full-year margin guide. We've got a big backlog. And so we've got good visibility and what that margin profile looks like. And then we've certainly made an estimate on the specs that that will sell and close between now and the end of the year, but we'll give our 2023 margin guide later in the year. Michael Rehaut : Okay. All right. Fair enough. Secondly, obviously gotten a few questions about your spec strategy. And I think overall, we would still be fair to consider you guys predominantly a built to order builder. Just wanted to clarify, though, when you talk about, you'd said earlier, that specs are still down on an absolute basis, but you're trying to raise or increase the percentage. If I heard it correctly, I thought that the percentage that you're currently adding that you're trying to increase is more trying to get back to a normalized target even within your build-to-order model, or am I not thinking about that, right. And perhaps you're stretching the limits of where you would normally be in pushing a little bit of a higher level of spec on a relative percent of closing spaces? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, I think that's right. We're at 30% today. So we're at the high side of what our historical ranges, you'll probably see us push a little bit behind that, but beyond that, but it's not as if, we're going to go to 70% spec production. So I think you'll see us predominantly stay a build-to-order builder that's what we believe that's the right way to run a home builder for us, based on the consumers that we target and the way we do communities, but yes, you're going to see a stretch a little beyond maybe what our normal range is. Bob highlighted that by design. We normally have more specs in our Centex communities, which are targeted to the first time buyer. You'll see us put more spec inventory than what we normally do into our move up in our active adult communities. But on a -- it'll be a little bit more than normal. Michael Rehaut : All right. Thank you very much. Ryan Marshall : Yes. Operator : Our final question for today is from Anthony Pettinari with Citi Group. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] in on for Anthony. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just want to know if interest rates stay roughly where they are now, should we expect your sort of elevated cancellation rate to persist into 3Q? Or maybe a drops back down more rapidly as sort of sticker shock wears off? And are you seeing elevated cancellation rates on the homes you're selling in July? Ryan Marshall : Yes, so I think as Bob highlighted, the uptick that we've seen in cancellations has really been in the last 30 to 60 days. And the probably the leading drivers than buyers are more. So I think a big part of that comes from buyers that were caught. They made it a buying decision during the run up and interest rates and as interest rates and talk of recession have increased, their buyer's remorse has also increased or their fears increased with it. So I think as we get to stability and predictability, we'll likely see, we should see that drop. And our expectation would be that cancellation rates ought to more come into a normal range. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. And then I heard it correct on the call, you kind of kept your community count guidance unchanged from last quarter. And so just, if I'm understanding correctly, a slowdown in sales would or would normally saw a community close out, so maybe like a higher community count. So it's just it's the reason for the unchanged guide, maybe a deliberate slowdown in community openings, or maybe some incremental horizontal development challenges, like, for example, permitting? Ryan Marshall : Yes, obviously, we are dealing with the same kind of challenges everybody else's. So it takes things a little bit longer to get open. What we tell you is that close out the impact isn't that great of stuff that didn't close that we thought was going to. So this is pretty much where we thought would be and reflective of as challenging market to get things open. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks. That's very helpful. Thanks for taking my question. Ryan Marshall : Yes. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it over to Jim Zeumer for any closing remarks. James Zeumer : Great. Appreciate everybody's time this morning. We'll certainly be available over the course of the day for follow-up questions. Have a good day and we'll look forward to speaking with you on the next call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, you may begin. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I want to welcome everyone to PulteGroup's earnings call for our third quarter ended September 30, 2022. Joining me to discuss PulteGroup's third quarter results are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the webcast slides that accompany this call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post a replay of today's call later today. As always, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by the comments we make today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying webcast slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I suspect that throughout this morning's call, we will find ourselves delineating between the favorable demand environment that existed earlier this year, which drove PulteGroup's third quarter earnings versus the more challenging market conditions we're encountering today. Stating the obvious, the primary difference between the two periods is that mortgage rates have more than doubled since the start of the year to upwards of 7%. Our Q3 earnings reflect the benefits of the strong demand and pricing conditions that existed at the end of 2021 and into the first few months of 2022. The favorable demand and pricing dynamics, which existed at the time are reflected in the 15% or $71,000 increase in the average sales price of closed homes that we reported for our third quarter. Further, even with tight labor and a difficult supply chain, we were able to leverage this pricing gain into a 360 basis point expansion of gross margin and an almost 50% increase in earnings to $2.69 per share. Bob will provide more details on our third quarter results in a few minutes, but it is important to acknowledge the success and recognize the efforts of the entire PulteGroup organization in delivering these great results. If our income statement demonstrates prior demand strength, third quarter order and cancellation rates show the more challenging market dynamics we are operating under today. As we move throughout the quarter, you could almost see demand ebb and flow with the movement of interest rates. Softness in July's home buying demand eased as mortgage rates fell in August. The positive trend in demand was short-lived, however, as interest rates surged higher in September in response to Federal Reserve actions and hawkish commentary from Chairman Powell. The pullback in demand was widespread across geographies and consumer groups as potential home buyers move to the sidelines, some because they can no longer afford a home and others because they were unsure if now it's truly the best time to buy a home. The impact of consumers dealing with issues of financing or fear also extended to our backlog as cancellation rates increased 24% in the quarter. While there are a number of factors influencing housing demand, the rise in mortgage rates has likely had the most significant impact on today's consumers. Based on their commentary, expectations are that the Federal Reserve will continue to aggressively raise rates to control inflation for at least the remainder of 2022 and then likely hold rates higher for longer. Given these market dynamics, we continue to meaningfully adjust our operating practices as we adapt to today's more challenging market conditions. On the sales side, we are working closely with our divisions on a market-by-market and even community-by-community basis to find pricing or buyers are able and are willing to transact. When demand first begin to slow in response to higher rates, incentives in most of our markets were focused on mortgage rate locks and buy downs, as mortgage rates have moved even higher, incentives have extended to other areas, including more aggressive discounting of standing inventory and price reductions. As we move through the third quarter, absorption paces were choppy, but on average, slowed as the quarter progressed. This trend continued into October, although ongoing adjustments to incentives and pricing are gaining some traction with consumers. We've told our divisions to be strategic in their decision-making, but we need to intelligently find the market and turn our inventory. The reality is that, we can't be margin proud, but rather, we need to protect our share of sales within the markets. Housing this front and center in the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation. As the Fed clearly desires, new home sales rates and selling prices are in the process of adjusting lower in response to higher interest rates. With home sales slowing, we are adjusting how we approach ongoing land investment. At the end of the second quarter, we controlled 130,000 lots under auctions. Given the more challenging demand conditions we face today, we are re-underwriting our land deals using price, pace and cost assumptions based on current market conditions, with a view towards assessing whether expected returns still achieve or exceed our required hurdle rates. As a consequence of these reviews, in the third quarter, we canceled agreements accounting for approximately 19,000 lots or 14% of the lots we held via option at the end of the second quarter. In taking these actions, we walked away from almost $800 million of future land acquisition spend. No one wants to write off $24 million of deposits and pre-acquisition spend, but the flexibility to exit these transactions reaffirms the strategic importance of building more optionality into our land pipeline. Homebuyer demand clearly moved lower as the third quarter progressed, but the dramatic and ongoing rise in interest rates likely being the biggest concern for most consumers. However, there are certainly other factors at play, including inflation, fear of recession or increasing concerns about job loss. Given all of these considerations, it is easy to understand why consumers have moved to the sidelines. Having said that, people still desire homeownership and are prepared to buy when they find a compelling offer. Operationally, we are appropriately taking a more defensive posture for at least the near-term as we work to navigate today's more turbulent conditions. We believe this approach is appropriate today, and appreciate that stability whether talking about mortgage rates, the stock market or inflation, maybe what people will need to move off the sidelines and become homebuyers again. Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a more detailed review of our Q3 operating and financial results. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. There's a lot to review this quarter, so I'll dive right in. Home sale revenues for our third quarter totaled $3.8 billion, which represents an increase of 16% over the same period last year. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven primarily by a 15% increase in our average sales price to $545,000. The year-over-year increase in average sales price of $71,000 was driven by improved pricing across all buyer groups as first time was up 20%, move-up gained 16% and active adult was up 15%. Unit closings in the quarter increased by 1% over last year to 7,047 homes. It's worth noting that approximately 200 closings that were slated for the fourth -- the third quarter were delayed due to Hurricane Ian as we shut down or slowed operations across a number of our Florida and Carolina markets ahead of the storm. On a year-over-year basis, the mix of homes delivered in the third quarter changed slightly as 36% were first-time buyers, 38% were move-up buyers and 26% were active adult buyers. In the prior year, 31% of homes delivered were first-time, 44% were move-up and 25% were active adult. The shift in mix to more first time is in alignment with our strategy of having approximately one-third of our business in the first-time buyer space. Net new orders in the third quarter totaled 4,924 homes, which is a decrease of 28% from last year. The year-over-year decline in orders reflect softer demand, resulting primarily from higher interest rates as our absorption pace fell to 2.0 homes per month, down from three homes per month for the same period last year. Along with a slower pace of sales, our reported net new orders in the third quarter were impacted by a significant increase in cancellations. Our cancellation rate for the third quarter was 24%, which compares with 10% in the third quarter of last year and 15% in the second quarter of this year. In the quarter, orders among first-time buyers increased 3% over the prior year as sales benefited from a double-digit increase in community count and the availability of quick move-in homes as the majority of our spec production is in our Centex communities. Orders for move-up buyers were lower by 45% than the prior year, while active adult orders decreased by 31%. Changes in community accounts did not materially impact -- did not materially impact order rates among either of these buyer groups. During the quarter, we operated from an average of 823 communities, which is up 7% from last year. The increase in community count is consistent with our previous guidance and reflects both new store openings and the slower closeout of existing communities. Average community count for the fourth quarter should increase slightly to 840. At quarter end, our backlog totaled 17,053 homes, which is down 14% from the same period last year. While unit backlog is lower, the dollar value of our backlog increased 3% over the prior year to $10.6 billion due to the rise in our average sales prices. We ended the third quarter with a total of 23,010 homes under construction, which is up 22% over last year. Of the units under construction, 65% were sold and 35% were spec. Consistent with comments made on prior earnings calls; we've been working to increase our inventory of spec homes primarily in our Centex communities to better serve first-time buyers. We continued start expects in the third quarter as we have continued to see buyer preference for homes that can close in 30 to 90 days across all buyer groups. At quarter end, we were still well below our commonly used metric of one finished spec per community. However, with 8,000 specs in production, we believe we are well positioned to meet demand and to compete effectively in our markets. Having achieved our targeted level of spec within our production universe, we have now lowered our spec starts and we'll manage our production to maintain the balance of our spec and dirt inventories, with an emphasis on build-to-order production for move-up and active adult consumers. Based on the homes we have in production and current sales rates, we now expect closings in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8,000 homes. The decrease in expected deliveries relative to our prior guide reflects the challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates and the ongoing impact of Hurricane Ian on our Florida operations. To the last point, while damaged to faulty communities in Florida and the Carolinas was limited, municipal resources are appropriately being diverted to the repair and restoration of services at the expense of getting power to new homes and communities. Based on the mix of homes we expect to deliver in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the average sales price on closings to be in the range of $560,000 to $570,000. At the midpoint of our range, this would be up 15% over last year. Please note that, all of the guidance we provide on this call, including ASP, reflects our current best estimate, but cancellation rates and pricing dynamics as we move through the quarter could impact our actual results. For the third quarter, our homebuilding gross margin was 30.1%, which represents an increase of 360 basis points over the third quarter last year. Referring back to Ryan's opening comments, our third quarter gross margins benefited from the strong demand and pricing conditions that existed at the end of 2021 and into the first half of 2022. These conditions supported the double-digit price increases we show in the quarter and allowed us to cover higher material and labor costs, including elevated lumber prices. The strength of demand in that period can also be seen in our sales discounts, which were only 1% for homes closed in the third quarter. By contrast, discounts on new orders taken in the quarter increased 180 basis points over last year to 2.5%. It's worth noting that, this increase in discounts is in addition to the higher financing incentives we've discussed during our Q2 earnings call. Financing incentives on new orders in the third quarter were 1.9%, which is approximately 80 basis points above last year and our historic average. Given the demand and pricing dynamics we are currently experiencing in the market, in addition to the increase in incentives needed to attract sales, we currently expect our fourth quarter homebuilding gross margin to be approximately 28%. This would represent an increase of 120 basis points over last year, but would be lower sequentially and is down from our previous guide. Given the changing market dynamics, our procurement teams are already having discussions with suppliers and trade partners in an effort to identify opportunities to reduce our land development and house construction costs. However, at this point, any savings we are able to realize would benefit our business in 2023. In the third quarter, our SG&A expense was $350 million or 9.1% of home sale revenues. This compares with prior year SG&A expense of $321 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues. The company remains on track for full year SG&A to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5%. Given the pullback in buyer demand and expectations that market dynamics will remain challenging for summer all of 2023, we are taking needed actions to better align overheads with current demand. For the third quarter, higher gross margin and greater overhead leverage helped PulteGroup generate an operating margin of 21%, which represents an increase of 410 basis points over the prior year. Turning to financial services. Our operations continue to face extremely challenging market conditions. In the third quarter, our reported pre-tax income totaled $28 million, which is down from $49 million last year. In the quarter, lower loan origination volumes driven in part by a lower capture rate and decreased profitability per loan were the primary drivers of the decline in pre-tax income. Capture rate for the quarter was 77% compared with 85% last year as our mortgage business seeks to be competitive but not to chase unprofitable business. Our tax expense for the third quarter was $183 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 22.6%. Our taxes in the third quarter include federal energy-efficient home credits, which were extended as part of the Inflation Reduction Act that was enacted into law in August of this year. In total, PulteGroup's reported net income for the third quarter increased to $628 million or $2.69 per share. The company's prior year net income was $476 million or $1.82 per share. In the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase activity, buying 4.4 million shares or another 2% of our outstanding common shares for $180 million or an average price of $41.20 per share. Through the first nine months of the year, we have repurchased approximately 9% of the shares we had outstanding at the beginning of the year for $975 million. Along with buying back stock, we invested $1.3 billion in land acquisition and development in the quarter, of which 56% was for the development of existing land assets. As Ryan discussed, in response to changing market conditions, we are re-underwriting every land transaction based on current price, pace and cost dynamics. We ended the third quarter with approximately 232,000 lots under control, which is down 11,600 lots from the end of the second quarter of this year due in large part to the deals we elected to terminate. At quarter end, 50% of our total land pipeline was controlled via option and we continue to work toward our long-term goal of getting to 65% to 70%. While we have terminated a number of transactions, there are land positions that we have under control that we still project to achieve or exceed our required rates of return. As a result, we currently expect to close on such transactions and expect our result in full year land investment to be approximately $4.8 billion, which is in line with our prior guide. Given the change in buyer demand and the resulting impact on the turning of our own land inventory, we currently expect that our land spend will drop materially next year. While we are still in the planning process, our preliminary estimate is that land acquisition and development spend in 2023 will drop by $1.5 billion to approximately $3.3 billion. Of this spend, we expect that upwards of two-thirds will be for the development of existing land assets. We will provide more details on next year's planned land acquisition and development spend during our Q4 earnings call. We ended the quarter with $291 million in cash and had $319 million drawn on our revolving credit facility. Our drawings under the revolving credit facility were driven primarily by our land acquisition and development spend, an increase in our house inventories as we move homes through production and the delay in closings related to Hurricane Ian. Our debt-to-capital ratio at quarter end was 22.5%. Wrapping up the higher interest rates being orchestrated by the Federal Reserve are achieving the Fed's objective in terms of slowing demand and negatively impacting price appreciation in the market. While conditions have gotten tougher, I am confident in PulteGroup's competitive position and in our ability to successfully work through this phase of the housing cycle. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Ryan Marshall : Looking at the tables in this morning's press release, you can see that on a year-over-year basis, our net new orders were lower across the country, although we continue to see relative outperformance in Florida, Texas and the Southeast. Generally, we are faring better in markets where buyers can still find affordability. In contrast, conditions in our western markets are clearly more difficult as price appreciation, generally higher selling prices and the spike in mortgage rates have force buyers to pause their buying plans. The softer demand conditions that we experienced in the third quarter continued into October and have likely gotten even more challenging with mortgage rates now pushing 7%. Running a homebuilding company during this part of an economic cycle is complicated, but we are fortunate to have an experienced leadership team that knows how to operate the business. We are taking action to impact the critical areas of the business, including finding price at a community level where we can sell homes. We will do the best we can to protect backlog, but we won't sit on inventory. With the right level of home inventory to meet demand and to compete effectively, we are aligning starts with the ongoing pace of sales and remain committed to our build-to-order model. We remain disciplined in our approach to land acquisition. It's hard to cancel a land deal that you've worked on for months or even years, but if the return is no longer pencil then we will walk away. We will work intelligently with our suppliers and trade partners to adjust costs given the new market pricing dynamics. And we will continue to evaluate and adjust our overhead spending and changes in current \u2013 to changes in current and expected construction volumes. For all the defensive actions we are implementing, I remain constructive on long-term housing demand. While we expect the coming quarters will be difficult for the industry, long-term dynamics for housing remain positive. If the Federal Reserve just pauses, or if the stock market doesn't swing 5% in a single day, or if inflation starts to ease, that might go a long way towards giving consumers enough confidence to get back into the market. While we wait for conditions to stabilize, we will be aggressive in managing our day-to-day business to sell homes, efficiently run our operations intelligently manage land investment and work to deliver high returns. I want to recognize our employees for their tremendous work in delivering a great third quarter. I also want to call out our teams impacted by Hurricane Ian. You have done tremendous work taking care of each other and the communities you serve. Before opening the call to questions, I want to provide a quick comment on the second press release we issued this morning. After a 30-plus year career with our company, John Chadwick, PulteGroup Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, has announced his plans to retire in 2023. John has had an amazing career with our organization, and has been instrumental in its success over the years. I know, I speak for our Board and our entire company in wishing John all the best in retirement. Brandon Jones, Senior Vice President, Field Operations, has been named to replace John effective January 1, 2023, as Chief Operating Officer. Brandon began his Pulte career 18 years ago as the Director of Operations in Arizona and has held a series of field positions of increasing responsibility, including Division President, in several markets and Area President of our Southeast area. Since being named Senior Vice President of Operations in 2021, Brandon has been managing our construction operations throughout the country, so I expect the seamless transition into his new role. John will remain with the company through April of next year to assist with the changeover. We are fortunate to have a deep and talented bench within PulteGroup, and I look forward to advancing the great partnership Brandon and I have built over the years. Now let me turn the call back to Jim. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions so we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. And now, Chris, if you will explain once again how to ask questions, we'll get started with Q&A. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Your line is open. Carl Reichardt : Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody. Ryan, can you talk a little bit -- you mentioned October pricing and it's the -- in October, you saw some pricing and incentives in certain markets are starting to have some traction. Can you expand a little bit on that, sort of, where and what you're doing where you might be seeing at least a little bit of stabilization in absorptions? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Carl. I appreciate the question this morning. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is we've worked through the changing market conditions over the last three to four months, early on our incentives were largely financing-related incentives, things that aimed at buying the rate down, extended rate locks, things of that nature. We felt early on that we were getting traction with consumers, especially when you could provide interest rates that were sub-5%. And in some cases, we were able to even get sub-4% with the incentives. As rates have pushed up into the 7% range, we're finding those things to be less effective. And so we've really focused the majority of our energy on pricing to what we believe current market conditions are. So price rollbacks and price drops. We have been strategic in those, Carl, but as I've talked about, we've worked to protect backlog as best we can, but we really feel it's important to continue to move inventory and to maintain the market share that we've worked so hard to get in the market. It's really those price rollbacks that we've seen get some traction over the last two to three weeks. And so we do feel while it's tough, we are encouraged with the activity that we're seeing. Carl Reichardt : All right. Thanks Ryan. And then can you talk a little bit about can rates by buyer segment and how those might compare currently to what your long-term averages are? Thanks. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah. We typically don't give that level of detail, Carl. What we have seen with cans is a little bit of a change versus where we were three months ago, we were seeing churn in the 30 to 60 days. What we have seen is a little bit more cancellation for folks that have been in backlog a little bit longer, and it's that rapid and substantial rate increase from when they signed. So at the end of the day, I think -- I don't think that we're surprised by that, but we have seen a little bit of movement from people that have been in backlog a little bit longer. Carl Reichardt : Okay. Ryan Marshall : The one comment I would offer to that, Carl, is we have historically seen the lowest can rate out of our active adult consumer that's a buyer that's not as heavily dependent on financing. That's been consistent over the years, and the trends that we're seeing today continue to support that. Carl Reichardt : Great Ryan. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it. Ryan Marshall : Thanks Carl. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Stephen Kim : Yeah. Thanks a lot, guys for all the color and good job in the quarter in a tough market. Wanted to ask you a question related to your strategy going \u2013 your strategy in light of the tremendous mortgage rate volatility that we've seen. I mean, obviously, in the last couple of months, it's just been volatility to the upward direction. But with the spreads over the 10-year treasury being what they are, there's a lot of thought that you might see a drop actually in mortgage rates at some point, tough to predict. You don't want to assume that, but I was curious to what degree you're ready for that, if it were to happen in the next several months. So, do you have a marketing plan to be proactive in the event you do see rates drop, let's say, mortgage rates drop back into the low sixes, let's say? Do you have a list of buyers who couldn't qualify today but could if you had a lower 6% rate? And can you give us a sense for how big that list might be? Ryan Marshall : Well, Stephen, let me maybe just start with saying we've got \u2013 we've got a really outstanding sales and marketing team that has always focused on the basics of working our entire lead funnel. And that hasn't changed in good market times or even these more challenging market times. So our ability to get relevant and timely messages out to our sales funnel, I'm very confident in our ability to do that. So if we're so fortunate to see rates drop. I know that, we can get the right messaging out to let folks know are \u2013 we really emphasize and push with our local sales professionals as well to maintain the relationships with our lead banks and with our interested buyers at a very local and personal level. So I think there's multiple ways using kind of the big bullhorn of the corporate marketing platform, but you've also got the grassroots local relationships with our sales professionals. Maybe just the last thing is I think the market itself, if we were so fortunate to see rates come back I think we'll probably be the greatest marketing machine of any of them. Stephen Kim : Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully, people have their ear to the ground. Great. Secondly, can we talk about production, could you give us your sticks and bricks figure to start with? And then when I look at your level of homes under construction, your inventory homes \u2013 or I'm sorry, your spec levels per community, the number of total specs you have per community. You were at 9.8%, if I \u2013 if my math is right, that's pretty significantly higher than what you were running at pre-pandemic, but you're also intentionally doing more specs. So I'm curious, what is the level of specs per community that \u2013 this is total specs, by the way, that we could expect by the end of the year? Ryan Marshall : Stephen, Jim will give you the sticks and bricks, and then I'll take the second piece of the question. Jim Ossowski : Under production, we've got $3.164 billion, and then we have another $328 million in models for sticks and bricks. Ryan Marshall : And then, Stephen, as to your question on our level of spec inventory, we're \u2013 we've been talking for the better part of the last two to three quarters about our desire to have more spec inventory in the system. Over the last three to four months as the market has slowed we've seen a real preference for homes that are able to deliver in the next 30 to 90 days, and that continues to this very moment. In terms of the inventory we have in our system, 35% of our leap [ph] is spec, and that is right where we want to be. So we feel very comfortable with respect to that. Looking at the finished inventory, we continue to have less than one finished home per active community, which has always been our historical benchmark. So we also feel comfortable that we're not under any pressure with finished inventory. We continue to see good flow-through of our sales rate of specs that are being sold and that are delivering in the near term, which is a real positive for us. And then maybe just the last thing, Stephen, and you've seen this transition over the last couple of years, as we've moved more of our business to the first-time entry-level product, we've intentionally put more spec inventory into those first-time entry level communities. And certainly, that's where the higher percentage of our spec inventory resides. So we feel comfortable with that. The last thing and I highlighted in my prepared remarks, as it relates to forward starts of new inventory, we've significantly slowed that, and we're matching that to what our sales rate is. So we think we've done exactly what we said we were going to do and we've made additional adjustments based on how we see market conditions at the moment. Stephen Kim : Great. Thanks very much guys. Operator : The next question is from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start, and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but just what as a percent of price or sales price, what were incentives running during the quarter and where did you end, and if that includes price adjustments as well? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah. So in the most recently printed quarter today, third quarter, our incentive load was 1% on closing. And that is a little bit better than last year, 30 basis points better than closings during the third quarter of last year. What we did highlight was on the sales in this quarter, so not the closings, but the sales that rate ran up to about 2.5%. So running higher and also that financing incentives, and we talked about this in the second quarter, we're up over sales in the third quarter of last year, so that the total load of incentive is up on current sales, by a couple of hundred basis points versus the closings that we had in this quarter. So then that will influence our business over that couple of quarters as those homes close. Ryan Marshall : Mike, the only -- in addition to Bob's comments, I'd just highlight that as we make price adjustments, those adjustments are made to base price. And so those adjustments aren't going to necessarily show up in the incentives that Bob just described. And we've talked about it for the last several quarters as well as we're opening new communities, which there are a fair number of those. We've been very intentional in pricing to the current market such that you have -- what we believe is a more normal incentive load. Michael Rehaut : Right. That's -- I appreciate that. I mean that's exactly what I was trying to get at in terms of where you are today. You kind of mentioned that, as the quarter progressed, you took perhaps a little bit more of an aggressive posture and as I said, trying to meet the market with price reductions and I'm sure price adjustments. So just trying to get a sense, I guess, as you've taken those actions maybe over the last 30, 45 days, if you could give us any sense in terms of what percent of ASP, those price adjustments or reductions might have amounted to at this point? And I would assume that that's something that we wouldn't see in the gross margin until the first half of next year? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah, Mike, it's \u2013 there's so much detail behind that, where \u2013 what the price points are. You can see, though, our sign-up \u2013 average price for sign-ups is down by about 6%. That certainly reflects some of the current pricing. You have to be a little bit careful because our sign-ups were a little bit more skewed towards first time, and so mix matters in that. So I wouldn't want to put a number on x percent down, because it really varies by market, by community. But again, you can see that ASP is likely to come down and there will be some margin consequence. And you can see it in the guide that we gave, where we at 28%. Ryan Marshall : And then Mike, to your margin question, yes, a lot of that will certainly be next year for homes that are on a build-to-order model. If it was a spec home, then those will show up more likely than not in the fourth quarter, and that is incorporated into the margin guide that Bob gave for the fourth quarter. Depending on kind of the nature of the adjustments we've made, some of those incentives also have flown into backlog as we work to protect the backlog and get those homes closed as well. That's also incorporated into the guide for the fourth quarter. Michael Rehaut : Great. One last quick one, if I could. Order trends by month, sometimes you were able to give that out. Just you kind of mentioned that, there was few differences a little bit as rates kind of fluctuated a little bit during the quarter. Just trying to get a sense of year-over-year trends and as you say that October kind of remained a little soft, if any sense of that type of number as well? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah. Without getting into the detail month by month, I think you heard it in Ryan's prepared comments. The demand equation followed the rate movements. And so you saw a little bit of a dip in rates in August. We saw some activity around that, where people came off the fence as rates progressed higher after that, we saw a relative decrease in demand. Operator : Next question is from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open. Matthew Bouley : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask on this $24 million write-down, obviously, small kind of in and of itself. But can you kind of speak or sort of how do you think about the risk of maybe larger write-downs occurring in that particular bucket where you saw it in the deposits bucket? And then ultimately, as this market evolves from here, what's the risk of write-down spreading to sort of the owned land portfolio? Thank you. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah. It's interesting. The market will tell us that. I don't want to predict. We've got obviously call it, $400 million, $450 million of total money at risk around option deals. So that's going to be pre-acquisition spend, legal, et cetera, as well as deposits. You heard us say and we've been doing this for a while now, we're reevaluating every land transaction. And it's interesting because we made the point in the prepared remarks we have been closing on a lot of transactions. And our expectation is that we will for the balance of the year, there will be some stuff that we walk away from. I wouldn't want to try and quantify it. But part of the reason our land spend is projected to go down next year is because it's getting harder to make stuff work, especially in things that were negotiated more recently. So as that stuff comes to the table, I think we're going to have some questions to answer internally as to whether it still meets our return requirements. The good news is, and again, it was in Ryan's prepared remarks, the 11,600 lots that we walked away from had a land act spend of $800 million. And if we had bought all that land at a point in time, that might have been some tough markets that we would have had to work through. So we feel -- and Ryan said it, we don't feel good about a $24 million charge. Having said that, having to work through $800 million of land with, oh, by the way, a lot of development spend on top of that. So we feel like it's actually operating the way we are as we look at the market, we're trying to get more of that optionality into our book. We've targeted 65% to 70%. We're pushing our teams to look for optionality, whether it be in time or take down. So I think -- I don't want to guess at what the market is going to bring to us. We'll work through each transaction as we go. Matthew Bouley : Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for that Bob. And then I guess the second one zooming into the margin guide. I think the Q4 guide is for -- margin is down 200 basis points sequentially. I know you mentioned everything around incentives and the change in price, perhaps more impactful to 2023. I think, Ryan, you just said that there's certainly some spec impact there in the Q4 guide. But just given a lot of these changes won't flow through into 2023, I'm just curious if you can bridge us to that 200 basis points decline in Q4 and why this margin decline is happening this quickly? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Matt, it was really wrapped up and I think the prior answer that I gave. As we looked at what we'll close in the fourth quarter, it incorporates specs that have been sold, some specs that still need to be sold, as well as some adjustments that flowed through the backlog based on pricing adjustments that we made in active communities. Those are the big drivers that are influencing the Q4 guide. The only other piece that I would add is there's a little bit of continued labor pressure with back-end trades, specifically the finished trades for what is still a pretty heavy load of inventory that's moving not only through our production machine, but the industry's production machine. We are starting to see some of that subside on the front end of things as starts have started to come down, and it's given us better ability to have productive conversations with front-end trades, as we work to pull costs back that are responsive to the dynamic environment that we're seeing. Matthew Bouley : Got it. Thanks, Ryan. Operator : The next question is from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. As demand has slowed and you've pulled the price lever to maintain volumes, is there a base level of absorptions we should think about as being a floor before you start to maybe see some diseconomies of scale? And is it possible to talk about what you see as maybe an ideal absorption pace, understanding it's a very dynamic market? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Anthony, it's a fair question, and I'll go back to what I think we've talked about for years. We really look to maximize return and so we're focused on both the pace and the price kind of levers. I would tell you, we'd like to see more volume than what we're currently seeing. But as I highlighted in our prepared remarks, we're trying to be strategic and take a long-term view of that's really underpinned by what we still see as a very positive housing market. Unfortunately, we've had a doubling of interest rates in 10 months, which we've never seen in this country, at least not in the last four years. And that's coming on the heels of an unprecedented global pandemic. It's created certainly some dynamics that we're being responsive to, but we're not going to overreact. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just following up on your comment on trades and some of those discussions becoming more constructive, can you quantify the extent to which your cycle times increased in the quarter or decreased, if at all? And would you expect a shortening of cycle times maybe in 4Q or early next year? Ryan Marshall : Anthony, we're \u2013 as I highlighted in maybe my previous question, we're continuing to see some back-end labor pressure with the finished trades. And then at the current environment, we haven't seen a bunch of progress with cycle times. We're still running right around six months, which is kind of unchanged from where we were in the prior quarter. I wouldn't expect to see any improvement in Q4. There's just too much production still on the machine. I am very focused with our production teams to claw back cycle time in 2023. So my hope would be by the time we hit Q2, Q3, Q4 of next year, we're starting to see some meaningful kind of quarter-over-quarter improvement as we get back to more typical cycle times. So I'm confident based on the drop in volume, but also just the healing of the supply chain, which continues to get better and better \u2013 that, that can become a reality in 2023 and beyond. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : The next question is from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Ivy Zelman : Thank you. Good morning, guys. I appreciate all the information. Maybe, Ryan, you could just speak to sort of broadly the consumer that has already put an order in \u2013 in backlog and the cancellations that you're seeing. Is this a function of how much of a function of not being able to afford the monthly payment versus how many people are just getting cold feet and walking away from built in equity? And then just more broadly, I get a lot of questions from clients, if you look at where rates are today, approaching 7%, what has that done in general to prospective buyer pool? Like where do you see? Is it now 25% of prospective buyers can't afford you more? I mean we see affordability as probably the most stretch it's been going back several decades. So maybe you can help us understand what needs to happen with respect to getting buyers more comfortable given such elevated pricing and the dynamics that led us here? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Ivy, thanks for the questions. I appreciate it. In terms of the cancellations that we're seeing, it's both. We're absolutely seeing buyers that can no longer afford, we're also seeing buyers that still can't afford, but they've gotten cold feet for whatever reasons. And in many cases, they're walking away from pretty sizable earnest money deposits that economically don't make a ton of sense, but that's where you really get into the psychology. They're just not confident in making a purchase. I'd tell you, as we look at the trends over the last couple of quarters, we haven't seen a noticeable or a significant change in the mix of reasons why folks are canceling. That's been pretty consistent. In terms of the buyer pool, Ivy, it's understandably less, and I'll specifically focus on who can afford as the industry is going through some pricing adjustments, I think we are working to get more people into that pool. The pool that's harder to quantify, and I'm not even going to attempt to guess is how many people are on the sideline because of psychological fear. Those folks just aren't engaging with us. They're waiting. And as I highlighted in some of my prepared remarks, I think the only way we get that buyer back into the market is through stability and those are unfortunately things that we don't directly control. So -- and we've highlighted what we think they are. Ivy Zelman : No, that's helpful, Ryan. And just if I could just follow-up on my second question as it relates to underwriting land right now and appreciating that you've taken some option on abandonments. Given the returns that are currently forecasted with the new pricing on communities that have not been yet open, but are slotted to be open? Are we talking gross margins that would hit the return requirements because you have always been underwriting to a much lower gross margin than you're currently, obviously, achieving? So should we expect margins to be more normalized on whatever you're moving forward with new communities given the pricing environment, or is there a risk that could even be below normal at this point? Maybe you could just qualitatively give us some direction? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Ivy. What I'd highlight is we underwrite return, we've never underwritten the margin. And so the screen that we're using in the current environment is we're using current pace and price against the historical return on invested capital screen and risk grid that we've always used. And we have not compromised on that. The -- so the deals that we've elected to walk away from simply don't meet that screen. The ones that we've elected to move forward with, by and large, continue to meet our return-based screen and that includes margins that are all over the board in terms of the historical range that we've typically operated. And Bob, anything you'd add in terms of underwriting? So hopefully, Ivy, that helps in terms of your question. Operator : The next question is from John Lovallo with UBS. Your line is open. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. The first one is just given the more cautious near-term stance, pulling back on land spend, which is clearly prudent in our view. I mean, where do you intend to allocate the capital? I mean, could you be more aggressive on buybacks or continue to be aggressive on buybacks? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah. We'll go through the same exact exercise we always have. It's interesting we highlighted in this call. We are out on our revolver, which is \u2013 we started borrowing a little bit last quarter. We're actually out on the line today first and foremost, we'll pay that off. Our expectation is that we'll be able to do that in short order. Then what we always do is look at what the next several years. So it's not a point in time, capital generation and usages and we'll consider investment in land. We've highlighted that we think spend is going to be down, we'll be building and monetizing our backlog. So we think we're going to be cash flow positive. And so we'll look at the capital base that we've got and what to do. And we'll have choices. We can \u2013 we will obviously continue our dividend. We can look at share repurchases. We will also be looking at our leverage. Obviously, the run-up in rates makes our debt a little more attractive on a pricing basis. Not suggesting, we're going to do anything, but it's \u2013 and we look at these things consistently through time, and we'll consider all those things. But I think you can \u2013 should expect to see us in market for equity, and we'll look at any other use of cash at the same time. John Lovallo : Okay. That's helpful. And then just kind of thinking about your overall land spend strategy now and just land in general, are you actually pulling back on community openings \u2013 communities that were slated to open? Are you holding back those given the demand environment? Ryan Marshall : Not at all. We're continuing to move forward with it and open those communities. And in fact, some of the communities that we've recently opened have been some of our brightest and best performers, which is really encouraging. I think there's two reasons for that, John. One, these are good communities and good locations that have got great interest lists that we've been working for a long time referencing back to the marketing comment that was asked a little bit ago. We've also been very deliberate in making sure that we're pricing the current market. Now, we do that all the time when we open up new communities, but especially in light of the current environment, when we're opening, we're making sure that we're opening at a value, and we've seen traction there. So communities that are opening today have been in our pipeline for a long time. They were bought right. They were arguably developed at a pretty attractive cost basis as well. And so we can continue to deliver nice margins and more importantly, good returns out of those communities. John Lovallo : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question is from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question, just maybe a follow-up on Ivy's questions around cancellations and maybe it's \u2013 I don't know if it's a terminology issue in terms of talking affordability versus outright qualification \u2013 challenges, but Ryan or Bob, could you address what percentage of your cancellations or as you're kind of hearing from the field around prospective buyers, how you're seeing outright inability to qualify impact versus just a, hey, maybe I can qualify, but I can't actually afford the x dollars a month in incremental payments. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Looking. I don't -- we're going to have to get back to you on that. What I could tell you is that it is again, running at a consistent percentage. We haven't seen a run up in the percentage of people who just don't outright qualify or rejections. So -- but what the relative percentage of that is, I don't know off the top of my head. Mike Dahl : Okay, got it. And then in terms of thinking through as are, obviously, pretty diversified in your market exposures in past cycles, you've seen builders of exiting markets during contraction periods. When you look at your land positions, when you look at some of the relative results across some of these markets, obviously, everything is getting hit, but some things harder than others. Are you at the point where you're evaluating whether or not certain markets makes sense, or maybe if there's any other regional color you can provide around something like that? Ryan Marshall : No, Mike, we actually feel really good about our geographic footprint. We've entered into several new markets over the last three to four years, and we're as confident in those today as we were when we made the decision to go there. A lot of the places that we've entered into in recent years have been places that have had really attractive job growth and really nothing's changed along those lines. There are also places that are attractive climates. They generally tend to be more affordable places and there are locations that are predominantly in the Sunbelt. So we think our new market expansion strategy still makes a ton of sense. In terms of our existing markets, we're really happy with them. I wouldn't -- I don't know that I have any real additional color to add in terms of the geographies that are doing well versus not other than what I highlighted in my prepared remarks. The Western markets are the toughest for sure. I think that's been widely reported by -- for many sources. We're also seeing relative softness in the Northeast, some of the more expensive locales. The Southeast, Florida, Texas, relatively or performing better for a lot of the reasons that I just touched on as with my comments on expansion markets. Mike Dahl : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Final question today is from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Truman Patterson : Hey good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. First, we've had a nice run of lower realtor and broker commissions throughout 2021 and the first part of 2022. I'm just seeing if you all started to pull that lever to help augment sales, especially with quick move-in homes are generally preferred by realtors. So just seeing if you're increasing commissions there? And if so, what impact that could be to SG&A? Ryan Marshall : Truman, the view that we've had on realtor commissions through time is to be balanced with it. We certainly appreciate when relators are the procuring cause or our \u2013 truly bring kind of a buyer into our sales office and help with that process. We've paid, I think, a market competitive broker commission. We're still in the same position today. So there's certainly cases here and there where you may have an above average broker commission, as an incentive to move a particular property that's got a unique set of circumstances, but broadly, you won't see us as a strategy employ above average broker commissions. Truman Patterson : Got you. Okay. But for the industry, has it generally kind of ticked up across the board or specific bonuses, et cetera? Ryan Marshall : I think it depends on the market and it depends on the builder. I think there are certain builders that part of their strategy \u2013 their marketing strategy is largely directed toward outsized or above average broker commissions. So as the market gets tougher, you're seeing certain competitors that use that as maybe their primary marketing tool, you're starting to see those bigger numbers come into play. Truman Patterson : Okay. Okay. Got you. And then could you all discuss \u2013 Ryan, you mentioned earlier about negotiations with trades and building products. But \u2013 could you discuss if you're getting any early traction on the price negotiations of any specific trades like framers or materials, building product categories \u2013 really outside of lumber? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Truman, it's really the \u2013 we've been talking with all of our trades, but I would tell you the more kind of recent and impactful conversations have been with the front-end trades \u2013 so underground plumbing foundation up through shell, exterior shell, those conversations have been frequent and helpful. Those are the trades that are feeling the slowdown in the industry right now. And so as they evaluate their kind of business situation and kind of the volume that they would like to be doing and what efficiencies look like. We're engaged in what I would tell you, are productive conversations. We need to pull cost out of housing generally. That's our organization, and that's our trades as well. I think we can all appreciate that we've seen unprecedented inflation, both in materials and labor. And those costs are real. And so I think we're trying to take a pragmatic but very intentful approach in how we try to pull cost out of the system. Truman Patterson : Okay. Got you. Thank you. And good luck in the upcoming quarter. Ryan Marshall : Thank you, Truman. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it over to Jim Zeumer for any closing remarks. End of Q&A: Jim Zeumer : I appreciate everybody's time today. So we could not get through all the questions, but we'll be available over the remainder of the day. Certainly, feel free to call or e-mail. Outside of that, we will look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We ended 2022 on a high note as we closed almost 8,900 homes and delivered all-time fourth quarter records with homebuilding revenues of $5.1 billion and earnings of $3.85 per share. These results, in turn, helped PulteGroup finish the year with over $1 billion in cash and a net debt-to-capital ratio below10%. Bob will detail the rest of our Q4 results in a few minutes. Driven by the company's exceptional fourth quarter performance, PulteGroup delivered another year of great financial results. For 2022, our home sale revenues increased 18% over the prior year to $15.8 billion, our reported pre-tax earnings increased by 37% to $3.4 billion and our reported earnings increased 48% to $11.01 per share. These results provided us the flexibility to invest $4.5 billion into the business, while returning over$1.2 billion to shareholders, dividends and share repurchases. Let me just pause right here and thank our entire organization for their efforts in delivering such a great operating and financial results under some challenging market conditions. We are truly fortunate to have such an outstanding team. In assessing our 2022 financial results, we fully appreciate that gains in volume, pricing, gross margin and earnings reflect the stronger demand environment that existed earlier in 2022. As we all know, the Federal Reserve decision to hike rate 7x in 2022 and its fight against inflation is successfully slowing the economy, including housing. For the full year, national new and existing home sales across the country fell 16% and 18%, respectively from 2021. Consistent with the trend of these national numbers, our 2022 net new orders were down roughly 27% from 2021. The softer demand we've experienced as a result of consumers priced out of the market by higher prices and higher mortgage rates, along with those individuals who have moved to the sidelines given market uncertainties and risks. Despite the higher rate environment dominating the national conversation, we saw buyer demand improve as the fourth quarter progressed and can confirm this strength continued through the month of January. We will have to see how things progress from here, but I think this improvement attests to the ongoing desire for homeownership that exists in this country. Net signups both in absolute number and absorption pace increased as we move through each month of the fourth quarter and through the month of January. While seasonal trends have been distorted over the past few years, monthly sales moving higher as the fourth quarter progressed is atypical. In short, we're encouraged by the recent improvement in our new home sales. Based on feedback from our sales offices, buyers have been responding to the decline in mortgage rates. Consistent with this idea, I would add that rate buydowns remain among the top incentives for our customers. Along with the decline in mortgage rates, actions we've taken to help improve overall affordability appear to be gaining traction. In alignment with our strategy to find price and turn our assets, we continue to implement programs that enable consumers to buy homes in today's higher rate environment. The cost of these programs which might include rate buydowns, lower lot premiums, or even price reductions can be seen in our higher Q4 incentives. In the fourth quarter, incentives increased to 4.3% of sales price. On a sequential basis, this is up from 2.2% on closings in the third quarter of 2022. Beyond just adjusting incentives in many of our active communities, we have already introduced smaller floor plans to help lower future prices and associated costs. The introduction of smaller floor plans is just part of a comprehensive effort to lower overall construction costs to help offset the pressure on sales price. The obvious question now is will this strengthening of demand continue? Like all of us on this call, I've heard strong arguments on both sides. But the honest answer is that no one really knows. Home Builders are optimist by nature. And I want to believe that the Fed can orchestrate a soft landing, but the risk of a recession is real. We're currently seeing buyers respond to lower rates, and better pricing. But what happens is fed actions weaken the employment picture is uncertain. With today's volatile market dynamics, one of our frequent conversations with investors is around how Pulte plans to operate its business over the near-term. Given the long timelines associated with land development and home construction, we need to set a plan, but be prepared to adjust as market dynamics require. At a high-level, I'd like to share how we plan to operate the business for the foreseeable future. At our core, we remain a build order builder, but our system operates best with a steady volume of production. As such, our plan for the -- our plan is for a consistent cadence of new starts. This would include starting spec homes on a pace consistent with spec sales. We've shared on prior calls that in the current environment, buyers are showing a preference for homes that have near-term delivery dates. As an example, in the fourth quarter, spec sales represented over 60% of our new orders. Our recent sales show that we are finding the market clearing price using our strategic pricing tools to set price and incentives. Within today's sales environment, we will be intelligent about the process as we optimize our production machine and turn through our land assets. As always, our primary focus will be to deliver strong relative returns on invested capital through the cycle. In planning for 2023, we have assumed our current cycle time of 6-plus months will remain the reality for the next several months. Combining our planned starts, with our 18,000 homes currently in production, we expect to have a production universe that will allow us to close approximately 25,000 homes in 2023. We have goals in place to reduce cycle time, and our procurement and construction teams are already realizing success in cutting production days, but a lot of work remains to be done. Buyer demand will ultimately determine what the coming year looks like, but this is our operating plan. We see this as a prudent, balanced approach that checks key strategic boxes, namely; we maintain a level of production in our communities, which is critical when negotiating with local trades and suppliers. We keep an appropriate level of specs in production while seeking to control finished inventory, and we continue to turn our assets, generate cash and position the business for the next leg of the housing cycle. Given today's market dynamics, at this time, we will be providing guidance for our first quarter, but not the full year. In sharing our operational approach for 2023, we have hopefully conveyed a thoughtful process and conceptualize the opportunity we see for our business. Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. PulteGroup completed the year by delivering a strong fourth quarter results, the benefits of which can be seen throughout our financial statements. In my analysis of the company's operating and financial performance, I will review our reported numbers as well as our financials adjusted for the specific items Jim noted at the start of this call. PulteGroup's fourth quarter home sale revenues increased 20% over last year to $5.1 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 3% increase in closings to 8,848 homes in combination with a 17% increase in average sales price to $571,000. The increase in average sales price in the quarter was driven by double-digit gains in pricing across all buyer groups. Our closings for the quarter came in above our Q4 guide as we benefited from higher spec sales that closed in the quarter and a faster-than-anticipated recovery in our Florida operations following the impact of Hurricane Ian. The mix of closings in the fourth quarter was 36% first-time buyers, 39% move-up buyers and 25% active adult. This compares with last year's closings, which were comprised of 33% first time, 42% move-up and 25% active adult. The increase in first-time closings is consistent with changes in our mix of communities and the greater availability of spec homes in our first-time buyer neighborhoods. Our spec strategy emphasizes production within our Centex brand as almost 60% of spec units are in communities targeting first-time buyers. In the quarter, we recorded net new orders of 3,964 homes, which is a decrease of 41% from the same period last year. The decline in orders for the period reflects the ongoing softness in buyer demand caused by the significant increase in interest rates realized in '22 in combination with higher cancellations experienced in the period. As a percentage of sign-ups, the cancellation rate in the fourth quarter was 32% compared with 11% last year. Cancellations as a percentage of backlog at the beginning of the quarter totaled 11% in the fourth quarter this year compared with 4% in the fourth quarter last year. I would note that in the 4 years prior to the pandemic, quarterly cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog averaged 10%, so Q4 cancellations in relation to backlog were in line with historic norms. In the fourth quarter, our average community count was 850, which is up 8% from an average of 785 last year. Community count growth reflects new community openings as well as the slower closeout of certain neighborhoods. Based on planned community openings and closings, we expect our average community count in the first quarter of '23 to be flat sequentially or approximately 850 communities. For the remainder of '23, we expect quarterly community count to be up 5% to 10% over the comparable prior year quarter. By buyer group, fourth quarter orders to first-time buyers decreased 28% to 1,574, while move-up demand was lower by 56% to 1,241 homes and active adult declined 36% to 1,149 homes. As has been widely discussed, housing demand remains under pressure as higher interest rates and years of price appreciation have stretched affordability for buyers. We ended the quarter with a backlog of 12,169 homes with a value of $7.7 billion. This compares to the prior year backlog of 18,003 homes with a value of $9.9 billion. As Ryan discussed, our objective is to keep turning -- keep inventory turning, which requires that we start an appropriate number of homes. In the fourth quarter, we started approximately 4,000 homes, which is down 50% from the fourth quarter of last year, and, on a sequential basis, down about 40% from the third quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with a total of 18,103 homes in production, of which 10% were finished. Of our total homes under construction, 43% were spec. This is slightly above our target of having specs comprised approximately 35% of our work in process, but given buyer preference for a quicker close, we are comfortable having a few more homes in production. Based on our production pipeline, we currently expect to deliver between 5,400 and 5,700 homes in the first quarter of the year. As Ryan indicated, for the full year, we will have the production potential to close approximately 25,000 homes. These production numbers assume a continuation of current construction cycle times. Given the price of homes in backlog, the mix of homes we expect to close and the anticipated level of spec closings in Q1, we expect the average sales price for Q1 closings to be between $565,000 to $575,000. At the midpoint, this would be an increase of 12% over the first quarter of '22. In the period, we reported gross margins of 28.8%, which remain near historic highs for the company. This represents an increase of 200 basis points over the comparable prior year period, although down sequentially from the 30.1% gross margin we delivered in the third quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to deliver another strong quarter with Q1 gross margins of 27%, which includes the benefit of lower lumber costs due to the fall in lumber prices in the back half of '22. Any savings from ongoing renegotiation of labor and material contracts will be realized in future quarters, and we will have to see how much of this work benefits our '23 versus our '24 closings. Our reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $351 million, or 6.9% of home sale revenues, includes a net pre-tax benefit of $65 million from adjustments to insurance-related reserves recorded in the period. Exclusive of this benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $415 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues. In Q4 of last year, our reported SG&A expense of $344 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues included a net pre-tax benefit of $23million from insurance-related reserve adjustments [ph]. Exclusive of that benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $367 million or 8.7% of home sale revenues. With the pullback in overall housing demand, we\u2019ve worked hard to ensure our overheads are properly aligned with today's tougher operating conditions. As such, we expect SG&A expense in Q1 to be in the range of 10.5%to 11% compared with 10.7% last year. In other words, even with lower closing volumes, we are in a position to realize overhead leverage that is comparable to '22. Reported fourth quarter pre-tax income from our financial services operations was $24 million, down from $55million last year. The decline in pre-tax income reflects both lower profitability per loan and an overall decrease in loan origination volumes as mortgage capture rate declined by 10 percentage points to 75%. In the fourth quarter, we walked away from 21,000 option lots and an associated $900 million in future land acquisition spend. As a result of these actions, we incurred a pre-tax charge of $31 million for the write-off of related pre-acquisition costs and deposits. This charge was offset by a pretax gain of $49 million in JV income associated with the sale of commercial property completed in the quarter. Our reported tax expense for the fourth quarter was $282 million, which represents an effective tax rate of24.2%. Our Q4 taxes included a $12 million charge associated with deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period. We expect our tax rate in the first quarter and for the full year in '23 to be 25%. On the bottom line, our reported net income for the fourth quarter was $882 million or $3.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, the company's net income was $832 million or $3.63 per share. These results compared with prior year reported net income of $663 million or $2.61 per share, and adjusted net income of $637 million or$2.51 per share. Moving past the income statement, we invested $1.1 billion in land acquisition and development in the fourth quarter, with almost 65% of this spend for development of existing land assets. For the full year, we invested a total of $4.5 billion in land, including $1.9 billion of acquisition and $2.6 billion of development spend. Given recent decisions to exit certain option land positions, we ended the year with 211,000 lots under control, which is down 8% from last year and down 13% from the recent Q2 peak of 243,000 lots. With the decision to drop option lot deals over the past two quarters, owned lots currently represent 52% of lots under control. As we\u2019ve discussed on prior earnings calls, given the slowdown in overall housing activity, we plan to dramatically lower our land spend in 2023. At this time, we expect our total land investment to be approximately$3.3 billion, with an estimated 65% of these dollars going toward development of owned land positions. Along with investing in the business, we continue to allocate capital back to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million common shares at a cost of $100 million for an average price of $41.81 per share. PulteGroup continues to maintain one of the most active share repurchase programs in the industry, having repurchased 24.2 million shares of common stock in 2022, or almost 10% of our shares outstanding, for $1.1billion at an average cost of $44.48 per share. In 2022, we returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. After allocating capital to the business and our shareholders, we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and a net debt to capital ratio of 9.6%. On a gross basis, our debt to capital ratio was 18.7%, which is down from 21.3% last year. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. For all the financial success that we realized in 2022, I can tell you it was a hard year to navigate. When the year started out, we had almost unlimited demand, but supply chain disruptions resulted in countless bottlenecks and extended build cycles. As the year progressed and rising interest rates push more and more consumers to the sidelines, we initiated a series of operational changes as we quickly adapted to the more competitive market conditions. If there is a silver lining in today's challenging demand environment, I think we have what can be viewed as favorable supply -- as a favorable supply dynamic. Recent figures from the National Association of Relators show the inventory of existing homes for sale at 970,000, or only 2.9 months of supply. Existing homes are our industry's biggest source of competition, so such limited supply is certainly advantageous. As we sit here today, I\u2019m incrementally more optimistic about the year ahead, but as the expression goes, hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. I think what we\u2019ve done -- well, I think that we\u2019ve done that in terms of how we've setup our business. We head into 2023 with enough units in production to meet demand and with production plans will allow us to continue turning assets. At the same time, we don't have an excess of spec homes in the system that will cause incremental self-inflicted pressures. We are in a strong competitive position within the markets that we serve. We are typically among the biggest builders in our markets, and our ability to serve all price points provides opportunities with land sellers and municipalities. And finally, we are in exceptional financial position with plenty of liquidity, no debt maturities for 3 years and expectations for another year of strong cash flow. There are opportunities to be seized upon even in challenging market conditions. When the time comes, PulteGroup will have the flexibility to take advantage of those opportunities. I will close by again thanking the entire PulteGroup organization for their work this past year to build outstanding homes and to provide an exceptional customer experience. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim Zeumer : Thanks, Ryan. We are now prepared to open the call for questions so we can get through as many questions as possible during the time remaining. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Devin, if you will open it up for questions, we are all set. Operator : Our first question comes from John Lovallo with UBS. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is, can you just give us an idea of the margin on quick move-in homes compared to the company average? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. It's interesting. It depends, and I hate to give you the mix, but geographically, it makes a difference. Obviously, we are going to see stronger performance in markets where we are seeing stronger sales activity, I think the Southeast of Florida, specs out West are a little bit more challenged. So it really does matter where. On balance, we've seen -- interestingly, if you think about our Q4 guide for margins, we outperformed it. Part of that was that geographic mix. We've talked about getting more volume out of Florida which is one of our better margin performances, but also because of the relative strength of spec sales, we did a little bit better on those than we anticipated when we gave the guide. John Lovallo : Got you. Okay. And then it was the commentary on demand getting better through the quarter and into January was interesting and encouraging. Can you just give us an idea of how broad based that demand was? I mean, was it limited to certain markets? Or was it pretty much across your footprint? Ryan Marshall : John, the improvement really came across the footprint on a relative basis. Speaking geographically, we continue to see strength in Florida and the Southeast. As Bob just highlighted in the last answer, we continue to see great performance out of the Texas markets. And probably one of the more encouraging signs that we've seen as we started to see our Western markets, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Southern California, Northern California, we started to see those markets come back to life. So kind of broad based improvement across the footprint. John Lovallo : Great. Thanks a lot guys. Jim Zeumer : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First question, you have lower lumber costs beginning to flow through the P&L and perhaps some other stick and brick cost savings. We also have likely higher land costs and perhaps some uncertainty around pricing. I'm hoping you can help us think through first quarter gross margins. Do you think it will be likely the low point for the year given the kind of sequential improvement in demand that you've seen? Ryan Marshall : Truman, I think you've highlighted the variables that are out there. And at this point in time, we've given a guide for Q1. And as I mentioned in my comments, that's the extent of kind of what we are going to provide at this point. Truman Patterson : Okay. Got you. Understood on that. And how are tertiary submarkets within metros performing relative to closer end communities maybe in entry-level move-up segments? I'm thinking that the prior remote worker or work-from-home tailwinds might be leveling off here, which might negatively impact the tertiary markets, but at the same time, affordability is a bit squeezed and the tertiary markets provide a better value proposition. Ryan Marshall : Well, Truman, I think, as we've talked about with our land acquisition strategy over the years, we've attempted to stay closer into the core, closer to the job market in some of the retail sectors. We certainly have a sizable first time entry-level buyer business and affordability there matters. So we do have communities that are more in the growth rings and on the -- in the tertiary areas, but I don't believe that our land footprint goes out quite as far as maybe some of our competitors. So what I'd tell you is it kind of depends on -- it's a community-by-community situation that is, as much as anything, from a margin standpoint, dependent on the structure of the land deal. And like, I think, you've heard from us in a lot of situations, we don't underwrite the gross margin, we really focus on underwriting to return. But going back to the question that John asked, we've seen relative strength and improvement in kind of sales across the board, that's not just geographically speaking, but that's community by community as well. Truman Patterson : Perfect. Thank you all for the time. Jim Zeumer : Thanks, Truman. Operator : Our next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice execution, and thanks for the time here. Ryan, just on the margin, I know you're not guiding beyond 1Q, but I'm just curious if you could talk through a little bit. When I compare you guys to some of your larger competitors, your margins right now are outperforming by a pretty wide level 400, 500 basis points. And while I understand there might be a little bit of a lag there given they're maybe more spec focused than you are, it's still a little bit surprising to see the outperformance. So could you talk a little bit about my understanding you're not going to give guidance, is that just a timing issue? Or is there something you guys are doing that is resulting in that outperformance, in your opinion? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan, thanks for the question. I appreciate it, and I think, for those that have followed us for years, yourself in that category, I think everybody is aware that we've implemented a number of really important kind of changes in the way that we operate our business that has driven higher returns over the housing cycle, and certainly, higher margins have been part of that. Those initiatives have touched everything from the way that we design our homes and communities to how we price and sell homes. And a really big part of it is the quality of the dirt that we're buying. A little bit back to the question that Truman announced a minute ago. And the way that we have evaluated and underwritten risk and the associated requisite returns that we ask for as part of the risk associated with those communities. So I think you're seeing -- I think you're certainly seeing that pay off. We have highlighted on this call, in my prepared remarks, the way that we are going to run the business in this environment, which is a tougher operating environment. And we really feel it's important to turn our inventory to get good flow-through and to sell and define kind of a market clearing price. So while we believe that the operating model that we have is a great one, and we are really reaping the rewards from it, we won't be immune to some of the market pressures that are certainly out there. But we think that we are an efficient homebuilder, and we are going to continue to be very disciplined and prudent in the way that we are making pricing decisions. Alan Ratner : Great. I appreciate all the thoughts there. Second question on the cost side. I think, over the last few months, we've heard a lot of optimism from homebuilders about their ability to renegotiate costs lower, especially as starts have pulled back as much as they have and what was shaping up to be a pretty volume outlook in '23. And your comments are similar to what we've heard from others that the market seems to be showing some improvement here. I can't help but look at lumber costs up 40% year-to-date and imagining that perhaps that might be filtering through to some other inputs as well. So what's your current thinking on the cost side? Are you feeling a little bit less bullish about your ability to kind of push back on costs now given what seems to be a strengthening marketplace? Or do you still feel like you can find some relief there as the year goes on? Ryan Marshall : Well, Alan, it's going to be tricky, and I will break down a couple of components that we are looking at on the cost side. We've talked a lot about affordability being the biggest challenge that we've had over the last several quarters. And I think affordability is going to continue to be the theme as we move through kind of 2023, not just in housing, but I think in all consumer spending, consumers are feeling the affordability pinch, and it's part of the reason that we've worked so hard to find prices that we believe help to address some of that affordability pinch. With that comes the cost side that you're appropriately highlighting. We have certainly seen and we've gotten very positive reception from our trade partners around the front end of the house as they've started to see a slowdown in new starts and kind of permits pulled. We've been collaborative in talking about what we're seeing and hearing from consumers. And they really -- they've worked to help reduce costs kind of as we've reduced our prices as well. We've seen a lot of progress with lumber. That's certainly a commodity and those things can kind of change. So we'll keep an eye on that. Probably the thing that I would tell you is going to be hardest on the cost side is the labor side of things. And that's the piece that I think will be sticky. Those wage increases have been real, and I think once those wage increases have been provided or given, they're hard to get back. Not impossible, but the material side -- not saying the material side will be easy, but I think we will likely have more success or easier success on the material side than we will labor. So time will tell as the year plays out. As I highlighted in some of my remarks, we've got some really aggressive goals that our procurement teams are working on to reduce overall costs. Alan Ratner : Got it. Just if I could squeeze in one last one there. So on the lumber side, I just want to make sure I understand the timing of this. You mentioned that you're benefiting now on 1Q deliveries from the pullback we saw last year. Assuming this 40% increase kind of holds here or maybe even goes a little bit higher, when would that eventually be a headwind to your margins? Would that be kind of a second half of this year type impact? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. Alan Ratner : Thank you, Bob. Appreciate it. Ryan Marshall : Efficient, very efficient answer. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ryan Marshall : Hi, Mike. Michael Rehaut : I wanted to circle back to the gross margins in the fourth quarter and the first quarter guide. And as Alan referenced, you\u2019ve a significant gap positively in your favor, obviously relative to the rest of the industry at this point. And it's interesting that, obviously, one or two quarters doesn't make a trend, but when you look back in prior years, the historical gap of gross margins was in the 200 to 250 bps range, and now we are talking double that, if not more. I just wanted to make sure because I think it would be helpful for investors to kind of understand. If there isn't any type of kind of short-term actions or things within the mix or relative to what you have in backlog that if there's any reason that there's some unusual short-term items that are helping the gross margins. Because we all kind of remember the comments you made last quarter of not being margin proud, and you didn't have a significantly lower order growth number than we were looking for, but just wanted to understand kind of some of the puts and takes there, and if you're doing anything significantly different in the industry in the marketplace that might allow this larger gap to continue. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, I think I understand your question. Hopefully, you appreciate, when we provide commentary on our results, if there are unusual things happening, we tell you about them, whether it's in the form of an adjustment or when we present adjusted data. And to answer your question as directly as I can, there's nothing unusual happening in our margin in the fourth quarter. We are not projecting anything unusual to happen in our margin in the first quarter other than the homes that we are closing. I think if you reflect on the answer that Ryan gave, and I can't comment on the relativity to other people's margins, what they're doing pricing lines, what we're doing pricing wise. We can only comment on what we are doing, which is trying to run a thoughtful business, get to a point where we can offer affordability to the consumer where we can earn a return. So I don't know if that gets where you need to be, but there's nothing unusual happening in our margins. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, and let me maybe just pick up on the comment you made about the comment I made last quarter about not being margin proud, that's still 100% accurate. And we've tried to reflect that in the way I laid out, we are going to be operating our business, which is to find a market price that will allow us to maintain a predictable and consistent turn of our inventory. It's the way that we can keep this business running efficiently and deliver the high returns that Bob talked about. So while we are -- we would certainly endeavor to do much better from a comparable sales standpoint than what we had in the fourth quarter. I think relative to our peer set, you can see that we are selling homes. And we are going to continue to make sure that we are priced competitively with our market offerings. Michael Rehaut : Yes. No, I appreciate that. I mean, I guess, I was trying to get to something you don't want to give, which is second quarter guidance, and we understand that. But I think people would kind of think, okay, you have a significant positive gap here as there were [indiscernible] drop maybe in the backlog that might allow that gap to revert to normal, but it doesn't sound like that's the case. I guess secondly, the SG&A guidance was pretty encouraging as well given the decline in closings yet the midpoint being similar to a year ago. So just wanted to delve into that a little bit. If you could kind of talk about what you're doing on the cost side there in terms of either headcount or other cost management? And if we were to expect a similar type of percentage decline in the coming quarters, given what you've been able to do in the first quarter, is that something where we could see a similar SG&A in spite of a 5%, 10% or, let's say, 10%-ish decline in closings? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, hopefully, you can appreciate we -- on our most recent call, had highlighted we would be looking at our overheads to make sure that they are efficient given the scale of the business that we are operating today. We have taken actions on costs, and they are varied by market depending on how that particular market is performing. I think you can and should expect us to always do that, right? I mean we are always looking at it. Are we running an efficient business? As it relates to beyond the first quarter, like everything else, there's -- it's a volatile -- not a volatile, but it's a market in flux. We haven't provided a guide on that. But I can tell you, we will be looking at our overheads as part of -- as we see the business develop, we will develop our plans around overhead spend as well. Michael Rehaut : Right. Just one last quick one, if I could. It's actually kind of also in response to clarification on a prior sneaking question. When you talk about the lumber costs being up year-to-date and that impacting maybe the back half of the year, just wanted to get a sense from you. I mean, on a dollar basis, it's significantly lower than it -- the percentage is kind of obfuscates the dollar amount, which is somewhat lower on an absolute basis when you think about where lumber was. And secondly, I would presume there's also some amount of potential labor savings that might come through in the back half just given where the market has gone over the last 6 months and a 40% increase in lumber, all else equal sounds one way, but, to me, there's potential offsets to that. Just wanted to know what you thought if that makes to you? Ryan Marshall : Yes. So in real math, our lumber load was down about $10,000 in the deliveries. Q1 will have that benefit in it. That obviously impacts the margin guide that we gave. I think you heard Ryan say that labor is actually likely to be a little bit stickier so we don't really know if we're going to be able to drive those costs down. So -- and Ryan, I think, said it well. Lumber is a commodity. We typically have the pricing of the lumber impact our closings two quarters in the future, right, because when we order then build the house so the pricing we feel in the market, we feel in our income statement two or three quarters later. And that's true for most of our commodity pricing. And I would tell you, other than lumber, it's been an inflationary market, so we've seen pressure on pricing. Again, Ryan talked about labor being a little bit sticky. Obviously, we are working with our trades, and it's how we build, where we build, can we help them be more efficient in order to offer us a better price, and that's what our procurement teams are working on right now. And as we highlighted in the prepared commentary, that process, whatever it yields, will impact our margin profile likely late in '23 or even into early '24 by the time those price changes get negotiated and then start flowing into houses that would close with a 6-month build time, again, two, three quarters from now. Michael Rehaut : Perfect. Thank you so much Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. [Indiscernible] you mentioned, Ryan or Bob, the mix of deliveries 36% first time, 39% move up, 25 active adult. Is your expectation for '25 -- or '23 on that 25,000 unit guide to be much different than that mix or shift in any meaningful way? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: It's interesting, Carl. I don't know that meaningful, but certainly, you heard a couple of things hopefully from us. 60% of our sales have been spec. They are -- our spec inventory is largely in our first-time communities. Our community count, which was up 8% year-over-year, the preponderance of that is in first-time communities. The mix of our lots looking forward is a little bit richer towards first time. So I wouldn't call it a big shift. But yes, I would tell you that first-time has been -- even if you think about the sales paces in the quarter, the decline was the lowest in that first-time space. So that's where the activity is today. Carl Reichardt : Okay. Thanks for confirming that, Bob. And then just on active adult, I'm curious how that business has trended. Has it been over the course of the last four months or so given that customer is more likely to pay cash, less worried about rates? We had a thin existing home sales environment, but the stock market has been tough. Could you just maybe chat a little bit about how that customer seems to be faring in an environment like this and contrast them with what you're seeing in the first time in the move-up market just attitudinally? Thanks. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Carl, it's a great question. And as I think you're aware, we are really proud of our Delaware business and what it adds to kind of the overall mix of our portfolio. You highlighted that buyer tends to be probably most reactive, positive and negative, to volatility within the broader market. And there's certainly been a fair amount of kind of volatility lately. That tends to cause that buyer to maybe pause as opposed to stop. On the positive side, you highlighted it's a thin resale inventory market. And so I certainly think that buyer has been able to sell their home. They've been able to sell their home, but I think at pretty good price. And on the buy side, they're not necessarily looking for a mortgage or the mortgage they're looking for is pretty small. So there are some puts and takes. A couple of other things that I'd highlight, relative to the other two buyer groups that we serve, they were -- the active adult was in the middle. They weren't quite as strong as the first-time buyer. Again, I think because they don't have to move, they've got options, they can be a little more patient. They were certainly more strong -- or did better than the move-up buyer, I think, mostly driven by the fact that they're not as rate sensitive. So on balance, Carl, we feel pretty good about the active adult space, kind of all things considered. And I think it will continue to be a strong benefit to the overall enterprise. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Q - Anthony Pettinari :  Good morning. Just following up on affordability, when we look at net order ASP, I guess, down 5% quarter-over-quarter, is it possible to break that out between incentives based price reductions and kind of any mix shift that you saw? Ryan Marshall : Anthony, we haven't provided that, and so we're not going to reluctantly. Q - Anthony Pettinari : Yes. I mean, directionally, is there a way to think about mix shift as being significant or not significant? I don't know if there's any kind of parameters you can put there? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Anthony, I think what I would tell you is that it's fluid. And sometimes things that start as kind of discounts off of a price or adjustments to lot premiums, sometimes those are rolled into kind of base price changes or base price reductions. And so the discount gets embedded over time into kind of what the new market price is. So, to Bob's point, we are not going to probably break it out at this point. But you can see, based on the incentive load that I talked about as well as the kind of reduction of base price, we are finding what we think is the market-clearing price to continue to sell homes. Q - Anthony Pettinari : Okay, okay. Understood. And then just I think your selling homes on land that was partially or maybe even largely put under control prior to the pandemic. Just how long kind of roughly before you sort of exhaust that cost basis? And then can you just touch on impairment risk? I mean what kind of -- what level of margin or price pressure would you need to see before a community would come under review for impairment? Ryan Marshall : Yes. So in answer to the first question, I think we, on average, been buying 3 to 4 years of land. When you add in development time lines, land is going to be hanging around 4 -- in the neighborhood of 4 years. And so if you think of that, pre-pandemic land would be kind of working its way through the system now. In response to the impairment question, obviously, we do impairment reviews every quarter. We are coming from a pretty strong margin position, but we always look and, for instance, in this most recent quarter, we actually looked at 16communities for impairments and impaired 4 of them for about -- it was about $2 million in costs that flow through the quarter, the other 12 did not. And so I think, absent some real structural shift in the market, I wouldn't anticipate a widespread kind of remark of our book. I think you will continue to see us as we look at this, evaluate communities one by one. And depending on the market conditions for that community, if we are in a position like we were with these four communities in the quarter, we'll adjust. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Ryan, Bob, appreciate the color so far. A couple of follow-ups here. In terms of the incentives, I think -- and maybe I'm mistaken, but I think the incentives, given we are on closings, the increase to 4%. Can you just help us understand, you talked about the improvement in demand, but also making further adjustments on price incentives. What's your current incentive load on orders, if you can give us that? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, we haven't. And to the comment that Ryan just made, I think he said it well. Pricing is dynamic in the market, right? And so if you adjust base pricing, it doesn't show as an incentive, it's just a lower sales price. And so on a relative basis, over time, we are in a position where we haven't given a guide on margin. We have given you what the incentive load went to, which was 4.3%, which is almost double, but there were price changes embedded in that, too, right? So all those things factor in, so the guide we've given for Q1 margin reflects everything that we've done to this point, and I think we will leave it there. Mike Dahl : Got it. And then in terms of the improvement through the quarter, I appreciate, like to get into the specifics here, but since you gave the commentary about orders progressing through the quarter in January, can you just enlighten us on a year-on-year basis? Where did you -- where have you stood month-to-date in January? Help us understand the magnitude of improvement versus what you saw through the fourth quarter? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, we don't -- we've never kind of given that type of kind of inter-quarter trajectory. So we are going to leave it probably where we're at, which is we are optimistic and encouraged, not only based on what we saw things kind of progressed through the fourth quarter, which, as I mentioned, is pretty atypical to see the fourth quarter build strength, but we've certainly seen that strength also continue into January. So cautiously optimistic and rates in that period have certainly been lower. So we think that has contributed. We will see kind of what the Fed does here in the next meeting. But all things considered, the operating environment, which we've -- I think we've talked at [indiscernible] is going to be more difficult. We are pretty pleased with what we are seeing in the sales for [ph]. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Yes. Thanks very much, guys. Encouraging stuff regarding your comments on the market, and that certainly aligns with what we're hearing as well. I wanted to follow-up on your comment about rates being a major driver to the improvement that you've been seeing. At this point, what share of would you say prospective buyers that you're seeing are having their mortgage application rejected? So you're actually not seeing them able to qualify compared with, let's say, what you would have seen in 2019. And when you think longer term about your business, I think you said 25,000 starts or something like that. How much of that production do you expect to be used for rental purposes relative to, again, a normal time, let's say, 2019. Ryan Marshall : So, Stephen, let me grab the first piece of that. I will let Bob take the mortgage side. I would tell you rate -- the first, your comment on rate, rate is part of it. What's really driving kind of the sales trajectory right now is affordability, and rate is part of that equation. We've also done things in the way we've repriced, the way we've created incentive loans that have helped so affordability as well. So I think that's a big part of it. I will skip to a couple of things that you said about production. Just to clarify so everybody is on the same page, we've got enough production based on what was already in production, plus what we intend to start that will deliver in this year such that our universe -- our production universe will be big enough such that we'd expect to have enough homes to close, approximately 25,000 homes. So -- and then from a rental -- your rental question, we've targeted -- if you go back to the announcement we made a few years ago that we want to do -- have roughly 7,500 homes over a 5-year period, kind of works out to be about 1,500 homes a year once we get fully kind of ramped up. So fairly small piece of our business, which is kind of how we strategically designed that. And I'll flip it to Bob, and he can talk about the mortgage piece. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. I guess the good news is, Stephen, we haven't seen a change really in people's ability to qualify, or we haven't seen people not being able to qualify increasing in a disproportionate way because of the rising rates. And I think more often than not, people know what they can spend. They're prequalifying as they go through the process. So over the -- I won't say that I know that versus 2019, but if you look back over the last year or 2 we have seen a pretty consistent cadence of the percentage of people that are canceling contracts because they can't qualify. It has not moved materially with the change in rates. Stephen Kim : Yes. That's really -- that's interesting and encouraging. I guess, Ryan, you just mentioned you sort of were more specific about your comment about that 25,000 unit mark, and that's helpful. And what I gathered from your comment is that you may actually start fewer than 25,000, correct me if I'm wrong, and so you're addressing sort of your ability to sort of scale down your starts as you have because you actually, I think, peaked at like 35,000 starts in 2021, I think it was. And so I guess my question regarding how you're thinking about the size of your business when things sort of normalize whenever that happens. How quickly could you reattain that level of35,000 starts? What would it take? Is that something that you think that you could do relatively quickly if market conditions permitted it? And then along with that, your lot count, owned lot count declined again this quarter. And I'm curious, do you expect it to decline further into the first half of 2023? Ryan Marshall : Well, Stephen, so there's a lot to unpack there. I will try and touch on as many as I can, and I will ask Bob for a little bit of help here. I'll maybe start with your starts question. We've got 211,000 lots that we control, half of those are owned. We've highlighted with the amount of land that our land spend for the year, which is going to be down substantially from 2022 with the lion's share of kind of what we're going to spend in 2023 be in development. Soon stuff that we've owned and we've purchased and we've underwritten and we're -- and we've got it in the kind of entitlement pipeline, we are going to spend the money to get those communities developed and open. So assuming the market cooperates and we see continued strength, I think that we've got the land pipeline such that we can ramp our production in concert with the consumer behavior. So I feel pretty good about that. And then there are a couple of other pieces there that you asked, Bob, -- maybe help me out here if there is anything that is the answer. Jim Zeumer : [Indiscernible] lots and what we are going to see in Q1, if there would be further decline. I think it was the \u2026 Ryan Marshall : In lots owned, yes, decline in lots owned this year or next quarter. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, like anything else, it depends on the demand environment, how many homes we close for lots, as an example, part of it will be things that are under option today. Are we able to negotiate? If we so desire a deferral of that. So it's hard to give you an answer on that, Stephen, because we are negotiating contracts all the time. Stephen Kim : Okay. All right. And what I was also asking, Ryan, was how quickly could you reattain a level of 35,000 starts? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Stephen, that's what I was trying to address with my commentary around land. We have the land pipeline such that we can do it. So really to be dependent on how deep -- how deep is the consumer demand, and can we get the trades back on our job site? It's part of the reason that you've also heard us say that we are going to continue to maintain a level of production that allows us to retain those trades on our job sites. So I think they're linked. It's a hard question to answer because I don't know the answer on when demand is going to return to that level. But suffice it to say, I think we've got a production machine that's capable of delivering that if demand is there. Operator : Our final question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. This is actually Charles [indiscernible] for Susan. I guess my first question is looking at the improvement in activity that you've seen through January, is it fair at this time to expect to sell space in Q1 to be in line with the pre-pandemic historical seasonality kind of a 30% to 40% improvement sequentially from 4Q to Q1? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: We haven't provided any commentary on the sales environment. And what we've highlighted is that it's variable. So I wouldn't want to try and answer that question for you. That's -- you can decide that? Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Okay. And second, you highlighted the potential to improve cycle times through the year. What are some of the key factors that could lead you to improvements in 2023, maybe between the material supply chain issues versus addressing labor availability challenges in the production? Ryan Marshall : Well, there's less production overall in the supply chain. So I think we can be more efficient with the labor that's there. And then the biggest issue that contributed to an elongation of cycle times over the last couple of years was impacts to the pandemic. A big part of that was supply chain related. There was also a decent sized piece of it in terms of the work environment, work-from-home, safe work environment, less inspectors in the job sites -- on the job sites, less permit reviewers in municipal offices. I mean it was really a combination of things, but probably the biggest variable that is really -- I don't want to declare victory, but it's probably better than it's been over the last couple of years as the supply chain environment is healing. Operator : That concludes the Q&A of today's call. I now turn the call over to Mr. Zeumer for closing remarks. Jim Zeumer : Appreciate everybody's time today. We are certainly around for the remainder of the day if you've got any questions. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Q1 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thank you, Audra. Good morning. I want to thank everyone for joining today\u2019s call. As you read in this morning\u2019s press release, PulteGroup had an exceptional first quarter and we are excited to discuss our operating and financial results. Participating on today\u2019s call are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; and Pablo Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning\u2019s presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will post an audio replay of this call later today. As noted in this morning\u2019s earnings release, to be more consistent with industry reporting practices, effective with our first quarter 2023 reporting, the company has reclassified closing cost incentives and cost of sales to net revenues for all periods presented. This reclassification impacted the company\u2019s reported home sale revenues and associated average sales price as well as home sale gross margin and SG&A percentages, but had no impact on reported earnings. An analysis of the impacts on the current quarter in comparable prior year period is included in this morning\u2019s press release and can be found in our webcast slides associated with today\u2019s call. Our comments today reflect these changes for all periods referenced. Also, I want to inform everyone that today\u2019s discussion includes forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim and good morning. Based on the improving demand dynamics we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year, we were cautiously optimistic heading into 2023. I am extremely pleased to report that the market momentum that began building in Q4 continued to expand into the first quarter of 2023. Today\u2019s stronger market conditions, combined with actions implemented by our outstanding field teams to enhance our competitive position helped drive our first \u2013 strong first quarter results that included a 15% growth in home sale revenues, a 100 basis point increase in operating margin and a 28% increase in earnings per share. Among the actions we have taken has been to increase our production of spec homes, a strategy we began implementing in the back half of 2022. As discussed on previous earnings calls, we made the decision to increase spec starts as we saw the opportunity to realize a number of strategic benefits within our homebuilding operations. With more units in production, we can better meet buyer demand as more consumers are seeking quick move-in homes as a hedge against rising mortgage rates. By maintaining the level of spec starts, we can commit to a more consistent start cadence. This is particularly valuable in today\u2019s environment when negotiating with our trades and suppliers. Keeping units in production allows us to turn assets more efficiently which is critical to delivering high returns over the housing cycle. The importance of having an appropriate inventory of spec homes available can be seen in our first quarter sign-ups, which on a gross basis increased 1% over last year to 8,900 homes. Of these sign-ups, almost 60% were spec sales, so the decision to increase spec starts was the right one. That said I want to be clear that our strategy is to keep starts directionally in alignment with market demand. We believe this balanced approach is consistent with both these historic business practices and allows us to turn our assets while maintaining a better margin profile. Our first quarter results show that we are successfully executing against this strategy as we realized strong sales while still delivering exceptional gross margins of 29.1%. You have heard me say that we won\u2019t be margin proud, but we also won\u2019t sacrifice profits if we don\u2019t have to. By being more measured in our starts cadence, we can meet buyer demand while not oversupplying the market. Case in point, we ended the first quarter with 1,500 fewer specs in production than we started the quarter. This gives us flexibility to maintain or increase production volumes, which in today\u2019s market is an important lever when working with trades and suppliers. As it relates to overall housing demand, home sales are benefiting from recent declines in mortgage rates, but I also think just having a general sense of stability in rates is important to consumer confidence. Given improvements in demand conditions in the broader interest rate environment as well as a generally limited inventory of existing homes, we are starting to see the pressure on selling prices ease in many of our markets. In fact, and well over half of our markets, we have found opportunities to pull back on incentives and/or move prices higher in many of our communities. While the price changes are modest, it demonstrates the point that people desire home ownership and are willing to buy when they see value. Earlier this month, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal that looked at the housing shortage in this country. The article raised the point that depending upon which expert you ask, the housing shortage ranges from 2 million to 7 million houses. While there are certainly debates about the number, I think there is broad agreement that we have a housing shortage. I believe this is one of the reasons homebuyers are quick to respond when affordability pressures can be eased. Before turning the call over to Bob, let me take a minute to address impacts on credit availability given recent disruptions in the banking industry, particularly among the regional banks. The short answer is that we have not experienced any disruptions. On the mortgage side, we are advantaged by having a captive financial services operation that routinely originates mortgages for between 75% to 80% of Pulte homebuyers that require financing. On the project side, big builders such as PulteGroup, self-fund or have access to capital that smaller builders typically cannot match. In the end, it maybe that recent disturbances in the banking sector may create opportunities for PulteGroup to put its more than $2 billion in total liquidity to work. I am very proud of our team as PulteGroup delivered exceptional operating and financial results in the quarter. I am also highly encouraged by the improving demand conditions we have been experiencing over the past two quarters. And I would add that buyer demand has remained strong through the first few weeks of April. While we have and will continue to take steps to best position PulteGroup for success within today\u2019s changing market dynamics, we remain measured and disciplined in our actions. From production rates and land spends to overheads and share repurchases, we remain focused on delivering performance over the long-term. Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Pablo Shaughnessy : Thanks, Ryan and good morning. As Jim noted at the beginning of the call, we have reclassified closing cost incentives from cost of sales to net revenues for all periods presented. The total incentive reclassified amounts is $81 million in the first quarter of this year and $38 million in the first quarter of last year. This reclassification impacted our reported home sales revenue and associated average sales prices as well as our reported home sale gross margin and SG&A percentages. An analysis of the impact of this reclassification in the current quarter and prior year periods is included in today\u2019s webcast slides. Where appropriate, any numbers referenced in my comments, current, past or future are inclusive of this reclass. Let me now get started with a review of our first quarter results. Home sale revenues in the first quarter increased 15% over the prior year to a first quarter record of $3.5 billion. Higher revenues for the period reflect a 6% increase in closings to 6,394 homes and a 9% increase in average sales price to $545,000. On a year-over-year basis, we realized higher average sales prices across all buyer groups, led by double-digit gains in both move-up and active adult. In the quarter, we reported 6,394 closings, which represents a 6% increase over the comparable prior year period. Our closings for the quarter came in above our guide as we capitalized on stronger demand for spec homes, an improvement in select areas of our supply chain that allowed us to close additional homes in the period. I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank our procurement and construction teams working in partnership with our trades and suppliers for their contributions over the last several quarters. Their efforts during a time of extraordinary market volatility were instrumental to the operating success we have achieved. Looking at the mix of our closings in the quarter, our results included 39% from first-time buyers, 35% for move-up buyers and 26% from active adult. In the first quarter of last year, the closing mix was 34% first-time, 40% move-up and 26% active adult. The higher percentage of closings from first-time buyers reflects our increased investment in that part of our business over the last several years as well as an increase in the availability of spec homes in our first-time communities, resulting from our decision to increase spec production to the back half of 2022. Looking at our orders in the quarter, our net new orders totaled 7,354 homes, which is down 8% from the prior year. Our cancellation rate as a percentage of beginning backlog was 13% in the first quarter, which is up from 4% last year. On a sequential basis, the 13% cancellation rate is up less than 200 basis points from the fourth quarter. So cancellations are beginning to stabilize. In fact, on a unit basis, cancellations in this quarter amounted to 1,544 homes, which is down sequentially from 1,871 homes in the fourth quarter. By buyer group, net new orders to first-time buyers increased 18% over the prior year to 3,177 homes, while move-up orders decreased by 20% to 2,645 homes, and active adult orders were lower by 22% to 1,532 homes. Our average community count in the first quarter increased 13% over last year to $879. Based on the communities opened in the period, our absorption pace of 2.8 homes per month was down from the prior year, but in line with our pre-pandemic sales rate, which averaged 2.7 for the 5-year period from 2016 to 2020. Based on land investments we made in prior years, we expect to operate out of approximately 900 communities in the second quarter, which would represent an increase of 14% over the second quarter of last year. Looking over the balance of the year, we continue to expect community count growth of 5% to 10% over the comparable prior year quarter. Given our expanding community count, PulteGroup is well positioned to increase its market share within the improving demand environment. We ended the first quarter with a backlog of 13,129 homes with a value of $8 billion. This compares with last year\u2019s Q1 record backlog of 19,935 homes valued at $11.5 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had a total of 16,872 homes under construction, of which 15% were finished. Spec units represented 38% of our production, which is up from last year and consistent with our strategy to have specs available to meet buyer demand for homes that can close sooner. Over the course of the first quarter, we started production on approximately 5,200 homes. This start rate was down about 40% from the first quarter of last year, but up on a sequential basis from the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to drive an appropriate start cadence as we focus on turning our assets. Based on the roughly 17,000 homes we have under construction and their stage of production, we expect to deliver between 7,000 and 7,400 homes in the second quarter. Given the ongoing improvement in the overall operating environment, we are pleased by the level of production we have been able to realize, thanks to the efforts of our outstanding operating teams. In addition to these higher unit volumes, we are also seeing the beginning stages of a shortening in our production cycle. At this point, depending upon the market, the gains range from just a few days to a few weeks, but the trends are generally positive. Based on our strong Q1 results and the potential for cycle times to gradually improve, the production potential of homes will have available to close in 2023 has increased to 27,000, 28,000 homes. This is up from our initial guide of 25,000 loans. Obviously, the strength of sign-ups in the second quarter will go a long way in determining how much of this production universe actually converts into 2023 closings. While the average sales price in our backlog is $608,000, we currently expect the average sales price to our second quarter closings to be in the range of $525,000 to $535,000. That estimate reflects both the mix of homes scheduled to close as well as the impact of anticipated spec closings, which are primarily first-time homes that have a lower average sales price. We reported first quarter gross margins of 29.1% which was 20 basis points below last year. Please note that our reported gross margins in the first quarter benefited by approximately 70 basis points from the reclass of closing incentives and cost of sales to net revenue. The benefit to our first quarter 2022 gross margin was 40 basis points. I would highlight that in the current quarter, our margins benefited from our move-up and active adult business where pressures on our selling prices have been relatively less impactful compared with entry level homes. After several years of gross margin parity across buyer groups, we are seeing a reversion to the historic trend of higher margins in our move-up and active adult business. Based on the mix of homes we plan to close in the second quarter, we expect gross margins to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%. As with our closings and reported margins in the first quarter, deliveries in the second quarter will reflect the benefit of lower lumber costs that are flowing through our operations. In the first quarter, we reported SG&A expense of $337 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues. In the comparable prior year period, our SG&A expense was $329 million or 10.9% of home sale revenues. Higher closings and associated revenues in this year\u2019s first quarter drove the improved overhead leverage relative to last year and our guide. With expected 2023 production volumes moving higher, we are carefully adding sales and construction staff, but still expect to maintain overhead leverage. As such, we expect second quarter SG&A to be in the range of 9.0% to 9.5%. In the first quarter, our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $14 million, which is down from $41 million in the prior year. Pre-tax income in the period was impacted by lower loan volumes, competitive pricing dynamics and higher mortgage incentives being used throughout the industry. In Q1, our capture rate was 78% compared with 81% last year. Market conditions have clearly improved, but as we do under all market conditions, we continue to routinely reassess our own planned positions and pending land transactions. Based on this review process, in the first quarter, we walked away from 5,300 lots that were previously held under option and wrote off approximately $6 million in associated deposits and pre-acquisition costs. In the first quarter, our reported tax expense was $170 million or an effective tax rate of 24.2%. We expect our tax rate in the second quarter to be 24.5%. Our net income for the first quarter was $532 million or $2.35 per share, which is up from prior year net income of $455 million or $1.83 per share. In addition to significantly higher net income, our earnings per share benefited from the company\u2019s share repurchase program. In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.8 billion common shares at a cost of $150 million or an average price of $54.30 per share. Consistent with our plans to continue returning excess funds to our shareholders, our Board has approved an additional $1 billion of share repurchase authorization, bringing the total available under the program to $1.2 billion. Along with returning funds to our shareholders, we continue to strategically invest in our business. In the first quarter, we invested $906 million of land acquisition and development, down from $1.1 billion in Q1 of last year. Given the stronger demand environment and the increase in our overall construction activities, we now expect to invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in land acquisition development in 2023. We ended the period with 210,000 lots under control. This is consistent with year-end and down 10% from last year. Based on our activity over the past several quarters, 61% of those lots are owned and 49% are options. We will continue to seek increased optionality of our land bank with a target of up to 70% of our lots being controlled via option. Reflecting the strength of our first quarter financial results and associated cash flows, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash, which lowered our net debt to capital ratio of 7.2%. On a gross basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 18.1%, down from 21.5% at the end of the first quarter last year. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. I think there are a lot of positives to be taken out of our first quarter results, including we delivered record first quarter earnings, driven by higher closings, continued strong gross margins and improved overhead leverage. Overall market conditions continue to improve as we experienced strong demands and are finding opportunities to reduce incentives and/or increase prices in many communities. Supply chain conditions are stabilizing, and we have seen at least an initial turn towards shorter cycle times. At this point, the gains have been market-specific but we are optimistic that we\u2019ve seen a high watermark in terms of construction cycle times. Our national and local teams are making strides and climb back construction days, which is critical because shortening our cycle time is an important driver to expanding our 2023 production universe. PulteGroup\u2019s Board approved another $1 billion increase due to the company\u2019s share repurchase authorization. We\u2019ve bought over \u2013 we have bought back over 40% of our shares and clearly remain committed to the systemic return of bonds to our shareholders. One other positive I would highlight is that PulteGroup was once again ranked among the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work for. This is our third year on this prestigious list and we again moved higher, climbing from number 43 last year to number 36 in the most recent ranking. We take fry and being included on this list because it is based on what our employees say about their experience as part of the PulteGroup team. Our success in delivering quality homes and delighting our customers starts and ends with our 6,100 employees dedicated to doing the right thing, taking care of our customers, focusing on quality and lifting the teammates around them. The amazing culture resident of PulteGroup doesn\u2019t happen by chance, but rather it comes from a committed effort by every employee to create a world-class culture. I am extremely proud of our team and I want to thank all of our employees, along with our trade partners and suppliers for their tremendous work in helping to deliver another outstanding quarter of operating and financial results. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim Zeumer : Thanks, Ryan. We\u2019re now prepared to open the call for questions so that we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of the call. [Operator Instructions] Andre, do you want to get the process started. We\u2019re prepared for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from John Lovallo at UBS. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is you guys talked about some of the pressure on selling prices easing and the ability to pull back on incentives or even maybe raise prices in some markets. I think 50% of the markets you said \u2013 can you just help us maybe frame which markets you\u2019re seeing the greatest opportunity to kind of pull back on the incentives and maybe the markets where it\u2019s a little bit more challenging at this point? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Sure, John. We\u2019re seeing continued strength in the Florida markets, the Southeast markets in Texas would be the three kind of regions that I would highlight with strength. Our Midwest business continues to be a steady performer. And then in terms of markets that are more challenging, it would really be the western markets, particularly the ones in the \u2013 the high-priced coastal areas Northern California and Seattle, probably being the two that I would highlight. John Lovallo : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then recognizing that you guys are not a spec builder, I mean, the move-in effort has been \u2013 it\u2019s been helpful, and it\u2019s been meaningful. Maybe could you just help us outline sort of your thoughts on that today? Where do you see this going? And will this be perhaps a slightly bigger piece of the Pulte business than it has historically? Ryan Marshall : Yes, John, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated exactly that. And I think it shows that when we started really talking about this middle of last year, that specifically with the first-time entry-level business, there was an opportunity to have more homes that were sooner deliveries, which help to alleviate \u2013 it really helped to alleviate pressure around interest rate, rising interest rates. It helped to alleviate pressure around certainty of when things we\u2019re going to deliver and we made the strategic decision to put more spec in the ground. To your point, we\u2019ve historically not been a spec builder, but it\u2019s never been a 0% of our business. We\u2019ve always had specs as part of our business, but we made the decision to make it a bigger piece. It got as much as high as about 45% of our total work in process inventory with spec. And I highlight that number, John, because that matches up pretty well with our Centex business, which is about 40% of our overall business, which is catered towards the entry-level first-time buyer. So in terms of where it goes in the future, we\u2019re going to continue to \u2013 as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, match our spec production with what we think the market demand is. And right now, that\u2019s certainly higher spec production than maybe what we\u2019ve historically done. It\u2019s working for us. And I think this most recent quarter\u2019s results are a great example of how that strategy is working. John Lovallo : Great. Thanks, Ryan. Operator : We will go next to Alan Ratner at Zelman. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice quarter and thanks for the time. Following on that last question, I guess, obviously, it seems like you saw a strong demand for the spec inventory you have on the ground. Would you say the momentum you saw in the market overall was similar in your BTO business as well and the skew towards more spec was just a function of where you had the inventory or do you still see kind of currently more of a desire for those quick moving homes versus build-to-order? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan, it\u2019s a good question. I would tell you, broadly, we saw strength in all price points. That being said, there is a higher likelihood of the entry-level buyer transacting at this point in time because they don\u2019t have a home to sell. And so they are not hampered by the low interest rate that they may be hanging on to with their existing home. But look, as we\u2019ve talked in prior calls, life continues to happen for buyers, marriages, more kids, relocations, job promotions all the things that I think create a need for a family and a potential buyer to move into a different home for whatever reason, our move up in our active adult business, they are certainly benefiting from that as well. We are seeing easing of sales price pressure in both the move-up and the active adult segment, which is allowing us to moderately raise prices and moderately pull back on incentives. And I think that demonstrates some of the strength we\u2019re seeing. We intentionally don\u2019t build a lot of spec in those price points. We find the debt buyer group. They prefer to have the build-to-order model. But when it comes to our entry-level first-time SendTech business, we\u2019re leaning in more with the spec first strategy, and it\u2019s working for us. Alan Ratner : Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And I guess on that note, if we think about the price point segmentation and entry level seemingly a bit stronger in the near-term. You kind of alluded to this when you talked about the margin differential reverting back to more historical norms where end level is a bit of a lower margin but higher turn business for you. How should we think about the margin going forward, assuming the mix of the business kind of continues on this current trajectory? You guided for margins to be down about 100 bps sequentially, which probably is some of that mix impact there. But can you quantify exactly what that mix looks like today and what it would look like if this mix holds steady here overall for the business? Pablo Shaughnessy : Yes, Alan, it\u2019s Bob. We haven\u2019t given a guide. There is a lot of moving pieces out in the market. So we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility based on our backlog and the sales activity we\u2019re seeing. The commentary was \u2013 if you think about the last several years, there is been sort of a compression in margins. And you saw it both in our results and our peers where some of the folks that were selling entry-level had higher margins than they historically would have \u2013 that was based on availability, pricing dynamics, a lot of different things. What we\u2019ve now seen is sort of in our book of business, and I think you see it more broadly in the market, that differentiation in margins between first-time move-up and active adult for us, pretty consistent in the most recent quarter with what I would characterize as the norm from several years ago, obviously, still very strong margins. You can see it both in our results and in our guide. So as you go forward, you heard Ryan say about 40% of our business is targeted at that entry level. That\u2019s a little bit richer than it was 4, 5 years ago for us. That was conscious on our part. And so if you think about mix adjusted over time, we will see a little bit more contribution from a margin perspective, worthing to always highlight we don\u2019t underwrite the margin. We are focused on return. And you made the point, I agree with you. That\u2019s a business that typically spins a little faster. So we\u2019re able to get the returns out of that business by virtue of that velocity coupled with the margins that we\u2019re able to generate. Alan Ratner : Understood. Appreciate that. Thanks a lot, guys. Pablo Shaughnessy : Thanks, Alan. Operator : We will go next to Stephen Kim at Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much, guys. Yes, lots of interesting stuff here, encouraging news. Let me \u2013 let\u2019s start with the \u2013 with your orders. I\u2019m kind of curious as to whether or not we whether you think that absorptions per community over the course of the next year or so, can be higher than the roughly $2.4 billion per month over the course of the year that you did pre-pandemic. And you talked about a production capacity of $27 to 28,000, up from what you said last time. But I\u2019m curious, does this assume any continued improvement in cycle times or is this literally if things just stayed exactly the way they are right now? Ryan Marshall : So Stephen, let me start with absorptions per community. Going back over the last several quarters, you\u2019ve heard me talk about, we\u2019re not going to be margin proud and that we are going to work and take market share and turn our assets. And I think you\u2019ve seen us do that. I highlighted in my prepared remarks today, that we\u2019re very pleased with the absorptions that we turned out \u2013 the absorbent for a community that we turned out of the first quarter. And we were able to do it at outstanding margins as well. So I think we were successful on both fronts there. Going forward, we are going to continue to follow that same approach. We think it\u2019s really important to continue to turn the assets and to continue to have high \u2013 reasonably high absorptions per community. And we will combine that with what has been historically best-in-class margin profile. And so we think we\u2019ve got a lot of the elements of our playbook and our strategy working well. In terms of the second part of your question, remind \u2013 cycle times. So Stephen, for our total year delivery, what we\u2019ve highlighted is that we\u2019ve got a production universe in process with \u2013 what\u2019s in process and what we expect to start, it will give us a universe that will allow us to potentially close up to 27,000 to 28,000 homes. We have assumed the cycle times that we are currently seeing. So we have not incorporated any improvement. We have seen improvement, and we\u2019ve incorporated that. We haven\u2019t incorporated further improvement. And certainly, we\u2019ve got lofty goals that we\u2019re endeavoring to claw back even more cycle time, but that\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work by our teams and our trades and suppliers. Stephen Kim : Great. And if I could sort of just follow-up on that last point, that production capacity of $27,000 to $28,000 is an encouraging number, obviously. And yet, your starts this quarter were a little on the lighter side relative to what we had been thinking. And certainly much lower than what you\u2019re expecting to close next quarter. So can you talk a little bit about why the start number was kind of where it was? And what gives you confidence that, that number can rise from here? That would be very helpful. Thanks. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, it\u2019s a multi-month kind of program that we look at in terms of the \u2013 our starts cadence and what we put into the ground I think it\u2019s widely well known that the first 3 months of the quarter tend to be more difficult on the weather side, especially for our businesses in the Midwest and the Northeast. So probably a little bit of an impact on the number being a tad lower, but our forward plans in terms of our starts cadence, that\u2019s all wrapped up into the 27,000 to 28,000 unit range kind of production guide. So I\u2019d probably look at everything in its entirety, not just what we started in Q1, but what was in backlog, what was in production, what we started in Q1, plus the kind of implied Q2 start rate. I think that all that all works into the way that we\u2019re running the business. Stephen Kim : Okay. So I\u2019m hearing there that you expect 2Q starts to increase. I don\u2019t remember \u2013 Bob, did you actually give a starts forecast for 2Q, because that would be helpful if you had it? Ryan Marshall : That\u2019s not a number we provided, Stephen. Stephen Kim : Okay. Okay, that\u2019s all I have. Okay, thanks, guys. Operator : We will go next to Anthony Pettinari at Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Hi, good morning. Cancellation rate came down pretty sharply quarter-over-quarter. I\u2019m just wondering, was there a particular month where that step down was most significant or was it pretty smooth throughout the quarter? Just wondering if the kind of normalization in cancellation rates is maybe more of a change in overall biopsychology or maybe just reflects kind of the backlog working itself through, any thoughts there? Pablo Shaughnessy : Yes. There wasn\u2019t \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a cliff. It was a pretty consistent cadence. And I think your point is a good one. The consumer has I think, largely now oriented themselves around the stability and rates that Brian talked about, they are moving, but they are not moving anywhere near as much as they were in the back half of last year. Couple that with the fact that most of the backlog and folks that signed contracts back when rates were much lower and got to a much higher rate at the closing table and the kind of the shock and cancellation impact from that has largely worked through the system. So I think the combination of those two things has the current contracted customer base and people signing contracts today are less sensitive to those rate movements than we saw in the back half of this year. And I think that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen the can rates. And candidly, the reason we provided it, we had less total cancellations in the first quarter than we did in the fourth, I think for all those reasons. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just from a big picture perspective, when you look at the quarter and think about the drivers of your gross margin beat versus your expectations. Was it primarily stronger pricing or executing on the cost side, maybe without cutting it too finally, I\u2019m just wondering what sort of surprised you the most around the quarter? Pablo Shaughnessy : Yes, I\u2019d like to tell you it\u2019s cost, but it really wasn\u2019t. I mean that was for the stuff that we closed in the quarter, those costs were baked in. We\u2019re working with our trades to find efficiencies going forward. Lumber was obviously a benefit, but we knew that. So that was in our guide. I think it really \u2013 and we highlighted this in our remarks, it was reflective of the sales environment. It was the relatively strong demand. It was our ability to manage our incentive load. So we\u2019ve had a national mortgage rate buydown program in effect since the beginning of the year. And what we\u2019ve been able to do is use that as another selling tool. And so for some people, it\u2019s, hey, get my rate as low as you can get it. For others, I want my rate down a little bit, and I want you to help you with closing costs. The nice part is that, that incentive replaced the incentives that we were offering before as opposed to added to it. And then you couple that with the fact that we highlighted that we were able to stop reducing prices and actually started to increase prices in more than half of our communities. Now these aren\u2019t massive increases, but it\u2019s the psychology of sales that relative strength was better than we had forecast in our guide for the quarter and showed up in the margin for the quarter. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. I will turn it over. Pablo Shaughnessy : Thanks, Anthony. Operator : We will move next to Michael Rehaut at JPMorgan. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, I just wanted to zero in a little bit, if possible, on the pricing trends. As you mentioned before, you said that you had increased prices maybe in about 50% of your markets. Just wanted to get a sense between the reduction or moderation in incentives that you\u2019ve seen so far year-to-date as well as maybe between that and some of the base price increases. If you could give us a sense of how much pricing \u2013 net pricing has improved from 4Q end to 1Q end? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, we haven\u2019t given that level of granularity. I think the previous question that Bob just answered really highlighted what we\u2019ve seen, which has been a build of kind of sales momentum if you remember going back to November, December of last year. The market was still pretty tough, but we did comment on our year-end report that we had in January that we are starting to see some momentum building in the back half of January or December and into January, we\u2019ve seen that continue, and that\u2019s allowed us to pull back on incentives. It\u2019s allowed us to take some very moderate price increases, but it\u2019s definitely a change in kind of the sentiment that we\u2019re seeing from buyers. I think some of that is interest rates stabilizing. I think some of that is the interest rate incentives that we have done, I think a lot of that is kind of buyer psychology. And then the biggest thing as I go back to, we\u2019ve got a housing shortage in this country, and that hasn\u2019t changed. And so in the places where we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate value, which we\u2019ve worked very hard to do, we\u2019re seeing some nice momentum on the sales floor. And I think you\u2019ve heard from us, we\u2019ve seen that continue into April. And that\u2019s allowed us to be optimistic and bullish with our forward start projections and some of the things that we\u2019re anticipating to be able to do for the balance of the year. Michael Rehaut : Great. I appreciate that, Ryan. I guess secondly, looking at the gross margins for the second quarter, you\u2019re expecting about 100 to 150 bps of potential contraction, just wanted to get a sense of if that is just due to the lagged impact of higher incentives from the back half of last year. And if that \u2013 because I believe you also mentioned that \u2013 if I heard right, and apologies, if I didn\u2019t, but that you are also going to see the benefit of lower lumber costs in the second quarter. But if the driver is that lagged impact of higher incentives from back half of \u201822, do you feel that that\u2019s mostly \u2013 will have mostly played itself out by the second quarter, or could there be incremental negative impact in the back half of \u201823? Pablo Shaughnessy : Well, we haven\u2019t given a guide beyond Q2. And there is a lot of moving parts in the market. The reason I mentioned that we are only going to go out one quarter, we have got lumber. It\u2019s ticking up again. That will be later in the year or into next year. It\u2019s worth that while looking at the cost environment, we still see inflation. We think that it\u2019s a little bit lower in rate than we probably projected at the beginning of the year, but we are still feeling cost increases and labor in particular is pretty sticky. We have talked about that. And obviously, if you look at the production cycle, our land is typically more expensive as we move through time. So, we have got incremental cost against a relatively flat at some points during the last two quarters, decreasing pricing. So, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s actually resulting in the margin decline year-over-year. The strength in the market that we saw last year produced largest we had never seen before, Mike. And this is just a reflection of the reality that costs are up, and we haven\u2019t been able to offset all of those to-date. Michael Rehaut : Okay. Great. Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Bouley at Barclays. Matthew Bouley : Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. So, just thinking about kind of the strength of sales pace during the quarter, kind of look back on the quarter, obviously there was a period where mortgage rates reached over 7% again. We had the sort of regional banking crisis where perhaps there was some impact on housing activity for a few weeks. I am curious from Pulte\u2019s perspective, did you see kind of impacts to your own sales pace during those periods, any kind of color on sort of the cadence through the quarter? And as we have kind of moved past that, how is sales pace trending to sort of exit March and into April relative to some of those uncertain periods during the quarter? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes. Matt, what we saw in the quarter was a strengthening of sales pace as we move January to February, February to March. Sequentially, sales paces got stronger. And then we have seen April continue to the first 3.5 weeks, three weeks of April continue to perform at a really strong level. So, we are pleased with what we are seeing. To your point, I think in certain markets, particularly on the West Coast during the banking, regional banking crisis, I think certain buyer groups in certain cities were probably more impacted psychologically than others. I think most of the things that we were seeing resulting from that have dissipated and we are continuing to see good momentum on the sales force. Matthew Bouley : Got it. Thank you for that. And then secondly, you mentioned at the top, some eventual opportunities to sort of put your liquidity to work if credit constraints with smaller builders amount. I guess I am curious how that might take shape from your perspective, kind of what are you seeing and hearing on the ground today from a competitive perspective versus these smaller builders? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Nothing necessarily on the ground yet, Matt. I think we are more being responsive to some of the things that have been widely written about and talked about that the smaller banks that provide operating lines and project-specific financing, that credit has gotten tighter. We are not in a position where we use project-specific financing. We are self-funded for almost everything that we do, and we have the ability to given our size to tap into the public capital markets, if so needed. So, I think when it comes to land development, land acquisition, the desire or the decision to put more spec into the ground, we have got tremendous flexibility because of the way that we are capitalized. And I do think that could potentially give us the opportunity to take advantage of any kind of dislocation that might appear. It\u2019s an always-on mindset, which we have always had, not trying to send any kind of a message there other than there was a banking crisis, credit has gotten tighter, and we have got our ears open to any opportunities that that might create for us. Matthew Bouley : Got it. Thanks Ryan. Good luck guys. Operator : And we will move next to Mike Dahl at RBC Capital Markets. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on the land dynamics and market [ph] dynamics, you did raise your land spend on the top end is up quite a bit versus last quarter. So, I wanted to just ask, is that incorporating any potential flex in acquisition spend and as you look to take advantage of potential disruptions later this year, or is that more of kind of a core something changed, either more deals kind of penciling that you thought you would walk away from or something else going on with either development or acq spend that you care to highlight in terms of that increase in the forecast spend? Pablo Shaughnessy : Yes. Fair question. That is just our projection of what we see on the ground. And so the increase in absorptions that we have seen, the relative stability in pricing gives us a little bit more confidence as we are looking at some of the deal flow that we \u2013 for land transactions, it does not anticipate or incorporate any M&A or anything of that sort that would happen separate from that, and we would evaluate it. But we haven\u2019t projected that in the overall increase. Mike Dahl : Got it. Okay. Thanks Bob. And then my follow-up, you called out the order trends by buyer segment, which was pretty interesting. Could you help us understand maybe the community count or absorption by our segment first time move up active adult? I think you said that the total was maybe up 18% in first time, but then down in the 20s on the other two segments. Pablo Shaughnessy : We haven\u2019t given that level of detail in a while. I think from a community count perspective, you have heard us say, we are investing in the entry level. So, our \u2013 a lot of the growth that you saw, we had growth across all three buyer segments in our community count. It was more oriented towards the first time. And interestingly, then next to the move-up and the active adult is those are bigger positions, so they don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have quite as much flexibility in those over time. But the 13% was spread across all, but it was largely in the first time. Mike Dahl : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Thanks Mike. Operator : We will move next to Susan Maklari at Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning everyone. First question is talking a bit about the SG&A. You mentioned that you are cautiously adding some headcount there. Can you just give some sense of how that\u2019s trending? And where do you expect that, that can go over time as you think about the level of deliveries you are targeting? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Susan, I think Bob highlighted in his prepared remarks, just with the increased potential for production in the year. We have raised our production potential by 2,000 to 3,000. So, we have added sales and construction headcount in the right locations that matches up where we have been able to kind of turn up the volume there just a little bit. We will \u2013 I think Bob highlighted, we will continue to maintain SG&A leverage as a percentage of revenue, so no hidden message there, nor should there be an expectation that you would see dilution to our leverage rates. Susan Maklari : Okay. And you increased the authorization on the buybacks this quarter as well. Can you talk a bit about your appetite to buyback the stock here? And any thoughts on how you are thinking of the cadence of that going forward? Ryan Marshall : Yes. We don\u2019t provide forward guidance, Susan. But in terms of appetite, I think the increased authorization, which we are very pleased our Board made the decision to increase the authorization by $1 billion. I think it shows that we have got a continued appetite for this to be a part of our capital allocation philosophy, which has been a consistent part for going on nearly 10 years. So, if consistency is a virtue, if it\u2019s not, we should make consistency of virtue, I think we are demonstrating that we are living up to the capital allocation philosophy that we have articulated for our shareholders. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thank you and good luck. Operator : We will go next to Dan Oppenheim at Credit Suisse. Dan Oppenheim : Hi. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can just talk about the West where you talked about some of the tougher conditions, how are you thinking about spec at higher price points and where it\u2019s more challenging? Are you doing \u2013 do you have much less in terms of spec per community in the West than you have in other regions? I am just curious how you are handling that? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Dan, in terms of the West, for us, it encompasses the coastal markets, California and Seattle, but also includes Las Vegas, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico. So, there is a mix of different cities and geographies and product types in the West. When we get into the coastal markets, we build a lot of multifamily three and four-story product. And so those buildings actually generally start as spec just by the nature. So, there is spec there and there is not anything that we are necessarily concerned about. We have \u2013 I would highlight in the West, we have seen some strengthening in Las Vegas and particularly \u2013 and Phoenix over the last two months to three months, we have actually started to see those markets firm up and start to get back on to some pretty positive sales trends and positive footing. So, the two places that we are continuing to kind of pay attention to Northern California and Seattle, those are markets that I think are pretty tech-heavy. The price points are generally higher. Affordability is more challenged. Also a couple of the areas that are probably more directly impacted by some of the regional bank crisis, so \u2013 but on the whole, we are still very optimistic about the way our West business is positioned just relative to Texas, the Southeast and Florida, those markets have done exceptionally well. Dan Oppenheim : Sure. It makes sense. And I guess you talked about cycle times coming down. How much \u2013 if we think about the conversion, how much would you say is driven by some improvement in cycle times versus just the specs and the shorter time from contract to closing on those specs? Ryan Marshall : Well, Dan, the way we are really looking at is, we are looking at it from start to final. And certainly, we pay attention to overall cycle time from start to close which has improved by a quicker flow-through on the spec side. But when we talk about cycle time, it\u2019s separate and independent from anything related to a buyer. It\u2019s purely within how long does it take us to build a home, and that\u2019s where we are starting to see some gains being made, particularly on the front end. So, for homes that are going into the ground now we measure it from slab to kind of frame as an example, frank stage. We are starting to see some pretty meaningful gains out of that front end of construction. The back end of the homes that are finishing now, they are still \u2013 those homes are still on longer cycle times, but we would expect to extend the gains that we were recognizing currently on the front end. As those homes get into the back end trades, we would expect to pick up time there as well. Dan Oppenheim : Great. Yes. I was thinking about in terms of the backlog conversion from those two issues. Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Next, we will move to Truman Patterson at Wolfe Research. Truman Patterson : Thanks for taking my questions. First on the entry-level orders, I believe you all said were up like 18% year-over-year. That\u2019s quite a bit stronger than where we think underlying entry-level spec demand is. Could you help us understand that a little bit? Is it easier comps, community location? Have you all early in 1Q \u2013 did you bring incentives more in line with the market, etcetera, just trying to understand that result a little bit better. And then could you help us understand just where overall absorption stood exiting the quarter in March? Pablo Shaughnessy : I was going to say it\u2019s hard to react to that. I think what we have seen reflected in our results is that we started fair number of homes that were speculative last year. They were available, and we have been able to sell them. We \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as a huge incentive. I have mentioned earlier, we have a national rate buy-down, and it is probably most appealing to that buyer group. But it probably is only a relatively small percentage of our total population of signups that actually took that. They may have other things that are more important to some buyers. Ryan Marshall : The one thing Truman, that I think I would probably highlight is that our entry-level product tends to be on the higher side of the price \u2013 the entry level price band, the locations are excellent. And so I think we have got a well-located product that\u2019s still within the affordable range that appeals to a first-time entry level buyer. And so if our performance exceeds maybe kind of what you are expecting, my guess is on a relative basis, that\u2019s probably some of the strength as we have got excellent locations for those entry-level communities. And then as far as kind of the exit rate for the quarter, that\u2019s not a number that we have quoted. I did highlight though on one of the previous questions, we saw absorption strength progress as we move through the quarter. So, March was our highest sales and the highest absorption rate of the quarter. We have seen strength continue as we have moved into April. Truman Patterson : Perfect. Thanks guys. And then can you provide an update on the strategic relationship with Invitation? I am just wondering if that might have been pushed back a little bit in the current environment with higher rates and higher cap rates. Ryan Marshall : Yes. We are very happy with the relationship that we have with Invitation. And I would probably answer the question more broadly about single-family rental. We have made it a small part of our overall production environment. We are looking at opportunities where we can provide a very, very small number of our total deliveries to the build-for-rent operators, Invitation being a big part of that. So, we are happy with how it\u2019s performing. We talked about it being something in the range once we get to full capacity of about 5% of our annual deliveries. We are still on track as we get this ramped up that that\u2019s about what it will be, and we are pretty comfortable with that. Truman Patterson : Alright. Thank you. Operator : We will take our final question from Rafe Jadrosich at Bank of America. Rafe Jadrosich : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments on the tighter credit. Can you talk about the potential impact to your land developers? Are you seeing any stress out there? And could that have any impact on your ability to option, or would you have to support your partners or take on more lots for yourself? Pablo Shaughnessy : Yes. Candidly, no, most of the folks that we work with are pretty well capitalized. They are big developers in their market. And the truth is that we self-develop a great deal of the land that we control anyway. We are not \u2013 the vast majority of our business is actually self-funded. So \u2013 but for those deals where we have got partners, they are typically pretty well capitalized. Rafe Jadrosich : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned earlier that the improving sales environment contributed to the gross margin upside versus your expectation, was the stronger sales improving traffic or better conversion or like a combination of both? Any color you can give on sort of quantifying which one of those drove upside to your initial expectation? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Traffic, I think was pretty consistent with what we expected. Conversion was better and the incentives that we had to provide to get that conversion were better than our expectations, which is what really contributed to the margin outperformance. Rafe Jadrosich : Alright. Great. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will turn the conference back over to Jim for any closing remarks. Jim Zeumer : I appreciate everybody\u2019s time today. We are certainly available for the remainder of the day for any follow-up questions. Otherwise, we look forward to meeting with you in the next quarter. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Abby, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Incorporated, Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute, to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And I will now turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Jim Zeumer : Good morning. And thank you for joining today\u2019s call, to discuss PulteGroup\u2019s exceptional second quarter operating and financial results. Along with affirming the ongoing desire for home ownership and the strength of overall buyer demand, our second quarter numbers demonstrate the strategic value of PulteGroup's balanced and disciplined approach to the business.  Joining me on today's call to discuss our Q2 results, are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Pablo Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior VP of Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning\u2019s presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will post an audio replay of this call later today. I want to inform everyone on today's call that today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.  Let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim. Good morning. As you read in this morning's press release, Q2 was an outstanding quarter for PulteGroup, as we posted strong financial results throughout our P&L, balance sheet and cash flow statement. In fact, our second quarter revenues, gross and operating margins and net income were at or are approaching all-time highs for our second quarter.  Our record financial performance in turn drove strong cash flows that helped to raise our cash position to $1.8 billion, while dropping our net debt to capital ratio to almost zero.  I am really proud of our homebuilding and financial services teams, for delivering these great results which are even more impressive given the variable market conditions we've operated in for the past 12 months. Within these complicated market dynamics, I believe PulteGroup's operating and financial success reflects the balanced and disciplined approach we take in running our homebuilding business.  We continue to successfully implement both a build-to-order model that serves our move-up and active adult buyers. In combination with a spec based model primarily within our first-time buyer communities. Our spec production is most heavily weighted toward our Centex branded communities, which operate under a managed spec production model. In other words, homes are started spec, that we have aligned to starts cadence with our sales pace. Given Centex is focused on serving the needs of first-time buyers, our long-term plan is to maintain a spec build model in these communities.  By being more balanced across build-to-order and spec production, we maintain a more consistent cadence of home starts, meet buyer demand more effectively, and we achieve the critical objective of turning our assets in support of higher returns. You can see the practical application of this managed approach in our Q2 numbers, as specs total 36% of units under production at quarter end. Of these units, we averaged just over one finish spec per community, which is in line with our stated goal.  Along with being balanced between our build-to-order and spec production, we were appropriately diversified across all the buyer groups consistent with our long-term goal of having 40% first time 35% move-up and 25% active adult. Why is this important? The different financial profiles associated with each buyer group can mean different responses to changing market dynamics, such as today's rising rate environment, which may hinder first time buyers, but be less of a headwind among active adult consumers. Being balanced across build-to-order, spec and buyer groups is also an important underpinning to the extremely high gross margins we've been able to maintain. More directly, we have enough production to meet buyer demand, but not so much that we are no longer selling from a position of strength.  I think we've achieved the right mix as we increased orders and closings, all while two-thirds of our divisions are still able to raise prices in the quarter. Along these same lines, we continue to see pricing opportunities within our core build-to-order business that primarily serves our move up and active adult buyers. In our most recent quarter options in law premiums exceeded $100,000 per home. These are high margin dollars that are not as prevalent among first time buyers and certainly were an important driver of the strong 29.6% gross margin we reported in Q2.  When the market started slowing in 2022, I said that we couldn't be margin proud, but rather we had to find price and turn our assets, delivering 24% growth in Q2 orders. And as Bob will detail guiding the margins of 29% or better for the remainder of the year, we are achieving both high margins and high asset turns, which drove our 32% return on equity.  Beyond the company's specific benefits, we're realizing from how we run our business, we appreciate the favorable supply and demand dynamics resulting from the limited stock of existing houses available for sale. National Association of Realtors data for June showed seasonally adjusted existing home sales of 4.2 million, which is down a staggering 1 million homes from June of last year.  As has been well reported, there are millions of existing homeowners who are sitting on low rate mortgages established before the most recent cycle of Fed rate hikes. I recently saw an FHA graph that showed that more than 50% of current mortgage holders have a rate below 4%. I haven't seen any rate forecasts that show the country getting back to 4% mortgages anytime soon.  So it's likely that existing homes remain in short supply for the foreseeable future. FHA data, along with mortgage rate forecasts suggests that there may be an extended period during which mortgage rates stay above 5%, which likely prevents an oversupply of existing homes being released into the market.  Through the first six months of 2023, we generated $1.3 billion of net income and $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations. As a result, we increased our cash position by almost $700 million, while returning almost $500 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. I think these numbers clearly demonstrate the powerful results our company is delivering. With a backlog of $8.2 billion worth of homes to be built, improving cycle times and a solid land supply, we are well positioned to deliver even stronger performance over the remainder of 2023. Now let me turn the call over to Bob, for a detailed review of the quarter, Bob? Pablo Shaughnessy : Thanks, Ryan and good morning. Our second quarter numbers speak for themselves in terms of demonstrating the strength of our operations, and in turn overall housing demand, so I'll just dive right in.  Our second quarter wholesale revenues totaled $4.1 billion, an increase of 8% over last year. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven by a 5% increase in closings to 7,518 homes, in combination with a 3% increase in average sales price to $540,000. Our ability to meet stronger demand in the period with available spec inventory allowed us to slightly exceed our prior closing guidance. For the quarter our mix of closings was comprised of 41% first time buyers, 34% move-up buyers and 25% active adult buyers. The breakdown of our business remains in line with our stated targets of 40% first time, 35% move-up and 25% active adult. In the second quarter of last year, our closing mix was 36% first time, 38% move-up and 26% active adult.  Our net new orders in the second quarter increased 24% over last year to 7,947 homes. The double-digit increase in our orders benefited from the overall strength of market demand in the period along with our ability to capture this demand through a 14% increase in our average community count to 903 neighborhoods. The strength of consumer demand is also evident in our cancellation rate. Cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog was 9% in this quarter, which is down almost 350 basis points on a sequential basis from the first quarter.  The 24% increase in our second quarter net new orders reflects an increase in our absorption pace of 2.9 homes per month, up from 2.7 homes per month last year and resulted in higher net new orders across all buyer groups. In the period net new orders from first time buyers increased 28% over the prior year to 3,150 home. Orders for move-up buyers increased 33% to 2,897 homes and orders from active adult buyers increased 7% to 1900 homes. The year-over-year increase in first time buyer orders shows that our homes continue to offer a compelling value and meet the affordability requirements of this buyer group. At the same time, our higher net new orders in move-up and active adult buyers is a positive development and test to the broad mix strength of housing demand.  Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect year-over-year community count growth of 5% to 10% in the third and fourth quarters, each month compared to the comparable prior year period. Our backlog at the end of the second quarter was 13,588 homes with a value of $8.2 billion. In the second quarter of last year, our backlog stood at 19,176 homes, valued at a record peak of $11.6 billion. We ended the second quarter with a total of 16,740 homes under construction, of which approximately 6000 or 36% were spec. We continue to closely manage spec production as total specs under construction at quarter end were down 11% from last year. Finished specs are also consistent with our historical carry rate as we ended the quarter with about one finished spec per community.  In the second quarter, we started approximately 7,400 homes, which is up 41% compared to the first quarter of this year. Given the strength of PulteGroup's year intake orders and deliveries coupled with the status of our backlog and production universe, we're establishing a full year 2023 delivery target of 29,500 homes. Of this total we would expect to deliver between 7000 and 7,400 homes in the third quarter.  Our third quarter and full year delivery targets are benefiting from improved home construction cycle times, as our operations are realizing meaningful improvements in cycle times of homes they are starting today. Based on the mix of backlog homes we expect to deliver in the third and fourth quarters coupled with anticipated spec closings we are projecting in those periods, we expect the average sales price on third and fourth quarter closing to be approximately $540,000.  Turning to margins, our reported gross margin in the second quarter was 29.6%. The improvement in our margins as compared to our previous guide was due to improve pricing on spec sales and increased closings from our higher margin markets, features compared to our prior estimates. In addition, as we discussed in our prior earnings call, our aggregate gross margins are benefiting from our move-up and active adult business, where profitability is holding up better.  Based on current market dynamics, we expect to maintain the strong margin position throughout the remainder of '23. And expect our gross margin to be in the range of 29.0% to 29.5%, in both the third and fourth quarter of this year. As we experienced for the second quarter the actual mix of deliveries, both in terms of geography and buyer groups may impact our reported numbers.  Our reported SG&A expense in the second quarter was $315 million, or 7.8% of home sale revenues, and included a $65 million pretax insurance benefit recorded in the period. In the second quarter of last year, our SG&A expense was $351 million, or 9.3% of home sale revenues. Based on our delivery targets for the remainder of the year, we expect SG&A expense to be in the range of 9.0% to 9.5% of home sale revenues in the third quarter in the range of 8% to 8.5% of home sale revenues in the fourth quarter.  Second quarter pretax income generated by our financial services operations increased 16% over last year to $46 million. Pricing conditions remain highly competitive in the mortgage industry, but quarterly earnings benefited from improved profitability within our title and insurance operations. Capture rate in the second quarter improved to 80% compared with 78% last year. Our reported tax expense in the second quarter was $233 million for an effective tax rate of 24.4%. We expect our tax rate for the remainder of '23 to be 24.5%. On the bottom line, our reported second quarter net income was a record $740 million or $3.21 per share. This was up from last year's reported net income of $652 million or $2.73 per share. Capitalizing on our outstanding financial results and resulting cash flows, we\u2019ve repurchased 3.7 million common shares in the quarter at a cost of $250 million, at an average price of $68.31 per share. Through the first six months of '23, we have used $400 million to repurchase 6.4 million shares or 2.8% of our common shares outstanding. We also invested $370 million in land acquisition and $523 million in related development during the quarter. In total, our land sale in the period was $893 million, which is down from $1.1 billion through the second quarter of last year. On a year-to-date basis, this year, we have invested $1.8 billion in land acquisition development, which keeps us on track to invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion for the full year. At the end of the second quarter, we had 214,000 lots under control, of which 51% were held via option. The total number of lots we control and the percentage of lots we controlled via option both increased from Q1 of this year as we are working to rebuild our option lot supply after exiting positions in the back half of 2022.  We also ended the second quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 17.3%. Given our large cash position, our net debt to capital ratio is now below 3%. Looking briefly at our full year results, on a year-to-date basis, we have generated net income of $1.3 billion, drove the book value of our stock by 12% and returned $472 million to shareholders. At the same time, our financial performance has permitted us to reduce our financial leverage to historic lows, and we have generated a return on equity for the trailing 12 months of 32%. Thank you, and I'll turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. As we've commented, homebuyer demand in the second quarter was strong and continued to exceed the expectation we had coming into the year. In the overwhelming majority of our markets, local pricing dynamics are stable to positive, and we continue to find opportunities to modestly increase net pricing in many of our communities. Further, at an absorption pace of 2.9 homes per month for the period, sales pace for the second quarter was above last year and generally above our pre-COVID averages. Demand in the second quarter was fairly consistent from month to month. And as you would anticipate, with a 24% increase in orders, we generally saw positive demand across our markets, which has continued into the month of July. That being said, on a relative basis, there are communities in our Western markets where we are still having to adjust pricing and/or incentives to entice buyers into our communities and ensure we continue to turn our assets. Given the higher interest rate environment, one of the changes we have seen is the slight increase in the number of cash buyers, particularly among our active adult customers. As this buyer group moves into our plans for retirement, they are making the decision to carry less mortgage debt given today's higher rates. At the other end of the price spectrum, final purchase decisions among first-time buyers are also being impacted by higher rates. As data suggests, some first-time buyers are opting to go with less square footage or fewer options and upgrades as buyers need to purchase a home in today's dynamic market environment is why our ability to offer a significant mortgage incentive nationally is such an effective sales tool. With that said, our first-time buyers remain financially resilient as personal savings remain the primary source of down payment. At the same time, we continue to see millennials are getting self-support from parents if they need help making the move into homeownership. One final note as to buyer sentiment, recent feedback from our first-time buyers indicate that an overwhelming majority bought a new construction Pulte home rather than an existing home because they felt it offered the best overall value. We've been extremely thoughtful about the home designs we are putting on the ground and the incentives we are offering to help ensure we are offering a compelling value to our customers. These comments in combination with our 28% increase in second quarter orders within the first-time buyer group indicate our efforts are meeting with success.  In closing, I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for their efforts in delivering such outstanding operating and financial results. Beyond the numbers we show in our financial statements, and continue to provide exceptional homes and home buying experiences to our customers. I will now turn the call back to Jim. Jim Zeumer : Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the time remaining. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. And I'll now ask Abby to explain the process and open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from John Lovallo with UBS. Your line is open. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is the 29% to 29.5% gross margins that you're expecting in the third quarter and the fourth quarter are clearly well above what we were forecasting. Just curious, are there any unusual items in there that we should think about? It sounds like mix is going to be a benefit. And what I'm really trying to get at is, what do you view as sort of the sustainable rate of margin? Is -- are we there? Is this sustainable? And if not, how quickly would you expect a reversion towards that more normalized rate? Ryan Marshall : John, good morning. It's Ryan. Thanks for the question. We're really pleased with how all of our consumer groups have been performing and certainly, how we saw the strength of sign-ups by consumer group in the most recent quarter. The mix of business, I think, is very consistent with what you've seen from us over the past 12 months. And as we mentioned in some of our prepared remarks, it's totally in line with kind of our stated goals. So really nothing there that I would highlight of note. And then in terms of kind of the forward kind of margin profile, we've given both a guide for Q3 and Q4, which I think what you want to read into that is that's where we see the business for the balance of the year, we're clearly not giving anything kind of beyond that at this point. John Lovallo : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one more question on margin. I think last quarter, you guys talked about the spread between active adult, move-up an entry level sort of reverting back to historical norms and I think that was a quick move-in portion kind of going back a little bit on the lower end. Given where housing demand is today and the desire for many folks to move in quickly, are you expecting that sort of quick move-in portion to actually trend higher again? Ryan Marshall : Yes, John, we've actually seen that be pretty stable in terms of the number of orders that are coming from our spec production, which is part of the reason we spent quite a bit of time talking about that today. We like the investment community to understand that the way we're running our production machine is very specific and intentional by buyer group.  Specifically, to your point with the first-time buyer group, that business is predominantly a spec business for us. The margins are lower to your point, which is a reversion to what we saw in pre-COVID kind of times that our first-time business was our lowest margin. We typically get a couple of hundred basis points higher out of our move-up and family business. And then our highest margin will come out of our active adult communities. We're definitely seeing that today. That's the other point that I would really highlight for you in kind of the guide that we've given for margins for the balance of the year. A big part of our business or a big chunk of our business is from our first time entry-level business, which is all incorporated into that guide. John Lovallo : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Great. Thanks so much. I guess, first question, just kind of asking the gross margins from a different perspective, and then I have a question on demand. When you think about the more challenged backdrop that the industry faced in the back half of '22, for builders that were more spec oriented, you saw the more immediate impact of that higher promotional, not promotional, but incentives and pricing adjustments that many builders made. You saw that run through the income statement much more immediately. We were estimating for build-to-order builders that, that would have a more of a lag effect. So, can you kind of walk through the dynamics of how you've been able to maintain since the fourth quarter? You had some pullback from 2Q '22, but nothing to the extent of the more spec-oriented, perhaps first-time heavy builders. Perhaps the product mix is a factor, but how that higher promotional environment has impacted the financials and if there's offsets to that, that have allowed a much more modest decline as well as for a build-to-order builder, a pretty nice element of stability going into the back half. So sorry for the long-winded, but just trying to understand perhaps what are the offsets to the higher incentive backdrop in the back half and the pluses and minuses there? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike. I'll let Bob maybe give you a little more detail on kind of the discounts in the quarter, which we actually -- we've seen kind of come down just a tab sequentially. So, in terms of the discounts, we are effectively using our discount money toward mortgage rate buydowns. It's particularly affected with that first-time buyer.  I think the reports and some of the data that's out there on mortgage rate environment, which suggests the sweet spot for most buyers is somewhere around 5.5%. So for us, it's really been to reallocating incentive dollars away from things that buyers may have previously used those incentives toward we're finding a lot of those incentives are being used in the mortgage rate environment. Michael Rehaut : And if, Bob, you can kind of weigh in on any of the pluses and minuses there, it would seem that to the extent that you had any impact from the higher discounting or price adjustment, it would be in the back half of full year guide. And so just making sure there's no other \u201cshoe to drop here\u201d or we've kind of worked through some of the more challenging backdrop there. I guess yes... Pablo Shaughnessy : Sorry, yes, there's no shoe, right? We have provided a guide. And so if you're focused on sales activity from the back half of '22, it has either closed or somewhat limited circumstances will close over the next three to six months. So it's in our P&L already or reflected in the guide that we have given. The relativity of our markets to the space, if you think about it, our margins didn't go up quite as much in '21 and into the beginning half of '22. And part of the reason for that was we didn't have as much spec production as others did.  And so they were pricing product at the time it was completed, getting full value for it whereas we were contracting often times three and six and nine months ahead of time. And so some of the price appreciation that went on in the market during the time we were constructing the home, we didn't feel the full benefit of that in our margin profile then. And so you saw kind of the really spec-heavy builders capturing every dollar of value. Now against the next -- if you think about the back half of '23-- sorry, of '22 and into '23, they were once again pricing at market. They had the full cost of a heavy lumber load, honestly, and an inflationary environment influencing their cost structure and prices weren't running quite as quickly, particularly in that entry level. So I think their reversion reflected the underwriting of land that they bought and the timing of their construction. Ours, again, for that spec business, we are fully engaged now on that. Again, that is -- you're seeing that in our margins today. It's always worth it to highlight we typically play at a little bit higher price point in that entry-level business, a little bit closer in. And so it's not quite apples-to-apples with some of our competitive set. So I don't want to sound defensive, but there's nothing really unique in this quarter's margin or we would have called it out. There's nothing unique that's coming in the next couple of quarters and the margin is going to stay pretty strong. Operator : We'll take our next question from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Your line is open. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, guys. Ryan, you mentioned that two-thirds of your divisions had raised prices over the course of the quarter. Could you expand on that a little bit? Does that mean net average order prices were up? And then can you talk about how that mix and price change was that reduction in incentives, increasing base prices, options upgrades, lot premium? Just want to get a little more color on the price increase activity you're actually putting into the mix right now. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Carl. Two things there. We did see price increases in some of our communities in two-thirds of the division. So it wasn't every division, it wasn't every single community. But we are seeing pockets of strength where we're able to, to your question, I'll answer the affirmative, it is a net increase in net pricing and it's coming through all of the options that you listed. So there are modest increases. And those are -- I would note that those are off of what we would consider adjusted kind of current cycle floor pricing. So we feel like we've seen a bit of strengthening in the overall sales environment, which allowed us to modestly increase pricing. Carl Reichardt : Okay, thank you, Ryan. And then to drill down on the first-time buyer Centex spec business, what kind of backlog conversion rate do you sort of target in that business specifically? And then can you mention maybe a little bit more color on cycle time improvement, where you have been, where you are now and where you think you can go with sort of normalized supply chain over the course of the next couple of three quarters? Thanks. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Carl. I don't have a specific number for you on backlog conversion of that specific buyer group. We could follow up with you offline on that. The things that we're really monitoring there, we're running a -- with that spec business, specifically, we're running a predictable and consistent monthly with start rate. And we've worked to match that start rate to what we believe our monthly sales rate has been, is and will be. And so it's part of what you heard me talk about in my prepared remarks around getting our start rate matched to the sales rate, which we think we've effectively done. And then the second question cycle times, Carl, yes, we're starting to see those come down very much in line with our anticipated improvements throughout the year. It's not been easy, it's been a lot of hard work by our procurement teams, our construction managers and certainly our trade partners that have helped us to reduce those cycle times. So we're seeing at least a couple of weeks come out of the cycle times and certainly starts that are going in the ground today. We'd expect to maybe even get a little bit more by the time that those deliver. That's been a big contributor to our success, not only in Q2, but to the updated and increased guide for full year closings that we've provided today. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : We will take our next question from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Stephen Kim : Great. Thanks very much, guys. Great job. Beats go on. Nice to see. I guess I had a question about, just to touch on the volume side of the story. Can you give us a sense for what kind of rate of growth in community count, the current level of land spend that you're allocating here? What kind of growth in community count can that support? It's a general question, looking out not specific to 3Q necessarily. And can you also regarding volume. Can you give us a sense for what the absorption rates? What the dispersion looks like across your three major segments? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen. I'm reluctant to answer your first question because we haven't provided any view beyond the third and fourth quarters. And so I'm going to pass on that. And then in terms of the absorption paces, we haven't provided that level of detail. What I can tell you is that in the current operating environment, the quickest-growing part of the business is move-up right now, interestingly enough. So absorptions there grew faster. We had absorption growth across all three demographics. And so we had highlighted 28% growth in the first time, 33% in the move-up and 7% in the active adult. But on a per store basis, all of them were up. The richest contributor to that actually was the move-up space. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open. Matthew Bouley : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess I'll just go back to the gross margin side. Maybe just to put a finer point on it. I think I heard you say that the, I guess, mix of sort of incentivized build-to-order product from end of '22 sales has largely worked through at this point. So what exactly would be, I guess, a worse headwind in the gross margin in the third quarter relative to the second quarter? Is it entirely mix of entry level -- or excuse me, first-time buyer spec? Or what exactly is the greater headwind to cause that sequential step down in margins? Thank you. Pablo Shaughnessy : Yes, it's a couple of things. One, we are an inflationary environment. Our land is more expensive, labor is more expensive, materials more expensive. You can see lumbers trending up given the faster cycle some of that is going to come into our production in the back half of the year. And then certainly, the mix on a geographic basis matters. And so we'll see some contributions from some margin communities that we've had to adjust as we've gone through the year. It's normal. So I know it's a non-answer, but mix always matters in that conversation. Matthew Bouley : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that Bob. And then, I guess, secondly, just back on that last point around the improvement in move-up, obviously, looking at the second quarter of last year, I mean, the comp is a little bit easier, but clearly, a nice step-up there. Any finer detail? I mean you gave a lot of color at the top around just what's kind of locking in existing home sellers at this point, but you are seeing this nice tick up in your move-up business. So kind of what do you think is sort of driving that? And do you expect it to continue relative to entry level? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes. Matthew, I think that's the biggest driver is there's just such a shortage of supply and fewer options for that move-up buyer to choose from. So as a percentage of the available choices that are out there, new homes have become a much bigger piece of that. And I think you're seeing our move-up business benefit from that. I would share that we've got great communities, we've got excellent designs. The quality of the homes that we're building, I think, are really speaking to that move-up buyer that's looking to add more space or get a newer, more energy-efficient, more technological advanced homes.  So I think those things are working to our advantage as well. And in this higher interest rate environment, our ability to offer our national mortgage rate incentive program to the move-up buyer is meaningful as well. That's a tool that we're able to effectively leverage that the resale market is not at the same degree. So I think a number of factors there with the headline being there's just less inventory out there. Matthew Bouley : Got it. Thanks, Ryan. Thanks, Bob. Good luck, guys. Operator : And we'll take our next question Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Alan Ratner : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I'd love to drill in a little bit on the topic from Steve's question about land spend. If you look at your closing guide, it's gone up about 20% for this year since the start of the year. And your land spend guide hasn't really changed, still kind of in that $3.5 billion to $4 billion range. And I know that's a big range, so maybe the answer is you're coming in closer to the high end versus the low end. But I'm just curious, as you think about the next few years, I mean, $3.5 billion to $4 billion, probably is pretty close to a replacement level of land, maybe a bit below, but as you think about the land market today and what you're seeing there, is that an area where you feel like at some point, you're going to have to put pedal to the metal and get more aggressive on land spend to drive future growth? And I guess, alternatively, is there a risk of a similar dynamic unfolding from a few years ago, where if demand stays at these levels and you don't see the opportunities in the land market, do you start to limit sales again and do things to kind of keep a lid on that to prevent gap-outs? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan, thanks for the questions. Ryan. A couple of things. Maybe I'd start with there. For starters, we actually did increase our projected land spend number about a quarter ago. So when we went into the year, I think we were right around $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. We've moved that up with the high end and as high as $4 billion, certainly down from last year, and that was intentional. When we look at our controlled lot supply, we've got 215,000 lots, plus or minus, under control. Over half of those are controlled via options. So we feel pretty good about kind of what's in the pipeline and what that will mean for the business. Market share and growth are certainly part of our story and part of the things that we're trying to do with our strategy.  To your question, Alan, around what are we seeing in the land market, I'd tell you that we're able to get deals done. It is a competitive market, and there certainly isn't anything that's being liquidated or fire sold, but we are to -- our land teams are doing a nice job finding good opportunities, and we've stayed consistent with our disciplined underwriting process, which has yielded the types of results and quarters that we've delivered over the last several years. So our plan is to stick with that to continue, to stay very balanced and disciplined and running a good business and being really laser focused on picking our spots with where we're investing more capital.  So to this point, I don't think we need to do anything along the lines of put the pedal to the metal. I think we're going to continue to be foot on the gas, but we're going to continue to focus on monetizing the 214,000 lots that we have, which we'll see what the market holds, but I think that will give us an opportunity to continue to run a very nice business that will grow in the market. Alan Ratner : Got it. I really appreciate that. That's helpful. Second, I do have a question about Florida. You guys are pretty as large in Florida, and there's been a lot written of late about the issues with property insurance in the state and some pretty staggering increases there. And I know some of that can be certainly sensationalized. But I'm curious, A, are you seeing that become more of a concern among homeowners or potential home buyers today in the state? And B, are you aware of anything that the industry might be doing to kind of deal with this issue, because it seems like it could have some long-term ramifications? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan. We haven't seen it become a problem for buyers to make the decision to move into our Florida communities. And in fact, our Florida business has been one of our strongest best-performing regions. And we've got a very diversified business in Florida that ranges from entry level to a heavy move-up business in Tampa and Orlando. And then when you get into South Florida, our active adult consumer and second home buyers are very prevalent. We've got great businesses there. Part of our financial services operation, we have an insurance company. We aggregate and we talk about the numbers and the business that they generate as part of our overall financial service portfolio. But we find that our captive insurance agency does a nice job helping to solve some of those problems.  Florida is one of those places, Alan, and I think over the years. There's been an ebb and flow of insurers that are in the market, they leave, they come back, having lived in Florida personally for a long time. I saw that happened over the last 15 years with my own insurance companies, but they wouldn't renew, they'd leave for a few years and then inevitably, they come back and they want the business again. So we'll keep an eye on it. California is the other state that there's been a lot in the news media recently about a lot of insurance companies that have left the state due to large losses. So certainly, things that we want to keep an eye on. I would highlight that there are -- there is a view that new homes performed better. They're in -- from a flood standpoint, they're up to spec out of the flood plain, higher than homes that have been developed in recent past. The drainage systems are more prevalent. They're built to current code. You've got new electrical, they're more energy efficient. So there's an argument to say there's potentially less risk with newer constructed homes. Alan Ratner : Thanks for the time. Appreciated. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. One more follow-up on the land side. Ryan, you mentioned you're not necessarily seeing like liquidation opportunities. The market is competitive. There were some thoughts or hopes that some of the regional banking fallout might shake some land to lose. Maybe you can comment on that.  But then also in terms of classes that your land teams are having, given the competition out there, has it been more that you're getting to your underwriting box because your current pace and price has improved? Or has it been a buyer as have also adjusted downward? I'm sure there's some blend, but kind of on average, what do you think is helping more at this point? Is it that buyers-- that sellers have actually adjusted? Or is it more that at current pace and price, more things hit the box? Pablo Shaughnessy : Yes. As always, as Ryan said, land is not on sale. We have not seen opportunities on large-scale things for banks or private market transactions of any substance. And in terms of the current activity levels, I think it's a combination of both and it probably depends on where you are in the country.  There are parts of the country where we have seen some willingness to negotiate on land because the market is a little stickier than it was 18 or 24 months ago. But by and large, no, the market is pretty firm. And we are -- we have not changed our underwriting screen at all. Based on activity levels that we see and can project, we're able to make them underwrite, but they're not on sale. Michael Dahl : Okay. That makes sense, Bob. And then just as a follow-up, maybe I'll broaden that out. Slightly when we think about some of these dynamics, could you just touch on more specifically your sticks and bricks cost, both in the quarter? How we should be thinking about that in the second half? I know you alluded to lumber -- some lumber increases maybe creeping in, but maybe any more quantification of sticks and bricks? And then on the lot side, how should we be thinking about inflationary dynamics in your way at cost here over the next, say, four quarters? Pablo Shaughnessy : Yes. I think on the land side, and we always answer it this way, we don't have any ramp up or ramp down in our land portfolio. And so the normal inflationary aspect we see comes if we buy land in three-year increments. We develop it. We then build on it and cost it off. And so we've seen a pretty steady increase. I wouldn't want to put a particular percentage on it because it varies on when we are in the -- if you think over the last five years, the way pricing has moved. On the vertical side and even on the horizontal development side to get outside of the acquisition side of the dirt, we came into the year projecting, call it, 12% to 14% increase in costs. We've been able to dial that down. We highlighted on the last call, we were 8% to 9%. We're still there. So our total house cost is up about that year-over-year, and that's going to be inclusive of lumber save earlier in the year. It started to pick back up, materials and labor is the real driver of that. We've been able to work with our trades to try and find efficiencies. Ryan talked about it.  We want to be a production consistent cadence of starts, consistency in the production cycle that makes it easier for the trades. And now that the supply chain is healthier, we've been able to reduce some of the cost increases through efficiency, not on the purchasing side for materials because, again, that inflationary aspect is there. And when you kind of wash all that together, we're seeing costs up, like I said, 8% to 9%. Michael Dahl : Very helpful. Thanks, Bob. Operator : We will take our next question from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Truman Patterson : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First, you all generated almost $1.5 billion in operating cash flow in the first half of the year. Clearly, you've been rebuilding your spec pipeline, you're kind of cutting back on some land investment, but you should still generate some pretty healthy net income in the back half of the year. I'm just really hoping you can run us through some of the pluses and minuses on your full year '23 operating cash flow potential. Pablo Shaughnessy : Yes. We haven't given guide on that Tru, but you're exactly right. I mean, if you think about it, we generated $1.5 billion through the first six months of the year. And if you put, I think, the closing volumes and the cost estimates for margins and for SG&A, the operating margin on that forward business at a sales price of $540 million is pretty rich. And certainly, inventory levels will change. But we think actually that we have an opportunity to reduce our investment in-house over the balance of the year because of the improvement in cycle times. So to your point, we're going to generate a bunch of cash in the back half of the year. Truman Patterson : Fair enough. Fair enough. And then just wanted to follow up on a prior question. Given the healthy demand rebound so far, it looks like your absorption levels are at pretty healthy levels, a little bit above what we'll just call kind of historical 2Q averages over the past decade, if you will. Could you just run through whether there were any geographies or consumer segment where you're actually perhaps curbing absorptions again as of the second quarter? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Truman, we're -- look, we're always balancing our production machine with the amount of developed land that we have in front of us as well as what our trade capacity is. But other than a unique community here or there that is way oversubscribed, we're not in the type of allocation restriction mode that we saw maybe during COVID. Truman Patterson : Right. Alright. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is Ashu Soni [ph] on for Anthony. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask relative to sort of the sequential price growth on ASP in net orders you saw in the quarter. Was that pretty much like-for-like? Or maybe there might have been some mix impact? And then sort of more broadly, would you say pricing power has gotten stronger at all versus where you were seeing it on your last call in April? Ryan Marshall : Yes. I think we highlighted that some of that in our prepared remarks, and there was a question earlier, we have in certain geographies and certain communities have been able to modestly increase prices from what was arguably a pricing floor after we made adjustments late last year. So part of that is related to an effective use of the mortgage incentive, which we've used to help solve some affordability challenges. But part of that is there's a real shortage of inventory and the market is allowing us to make some modest price increases. So all of that's kind of reflected in the results that we had for Q2 as well as the guide that we've given for the balance of this year. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. And then what are your thoughts on kind of the sustainability of progress you've made on cycle times and costs kind of heading into '24 as housing activity is heating back up. Are you -- do you anticipate maybe pressure on cycle times? Ryan Marshall : Yes. We actually believe that we still got opportunity to continue to do more. And Bob highlighted it in the question that he just answered a minute ago for Truman. As it relates to cash, as we feel that we've got opportunity to continue to reduce cycle time, not only in the balance of this year, but well into '24. It's predominantly coming from a healing of the supply chain and removing a lot of the inefficiencies that crept in, given -- but we had a broken supply chain and trades were incredibly inefficient. So we're making progress. We're pleased with it, but we're probably nowhere near where we'd like to be. Our target still remains getting back to pre-COVID cycle times, which is where I think the company can operate. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : We will take our next question from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is thinking a bit about the supply chain and the rise that we're seeing generally in starts within single family, how do you think about the industry's ability to continue to improve and perhaps sustain some of this as overall demand continues to move higher? And are there any areas specifically that you're more focused on or where we could perhaps see some issues bubble up again? Ryan Marshall : Yes. So the supply chain is mostly healthy. There are certainly pockets of places where we're continuing to focus. But I think labor, while tight, it's generally available, and we're making -- we're using it efficiently, and it's working. Supply chain, we feel pretty good about. The one area that I'd highlight is electrical components, specifically around switch gear that goes into multifamily buildings, so townhomes and condos. Those are more unique and sometimes customized products that are difficult to find in the cycle. And the lead time to get those things ordered has continued to extend. The other one would be transformer, so transformers that go into the horizontal land development side of things. Those are also in short supply. So a couple of things on the electrical component side. Other than that, I would tell you that labor and supply chain are operating pretty effectively. Susan Maklari : Okay. And then thinking about the business longer term, as you\u2019re early starts to come off the peak that we've seen more recently, but you think about the longer-term operating dynamics on the ground today and perhaps how they've changed relative to where we were coming into the pandemic? Are there things that you think you can hold on to so that the ROE can perhaps stabilize a touch higher than that 20% or low 20% range that you were in before COVID? Pablo Shaughnessy : Susan, I'll try. It's Bob. I think we are seeking to be efficient with our capital. We've got share repurchase activity we highlighted. We've got $400 million that we've done this year already. But we're creating a lot of equity through the earnings of the business. So I think the modeling that you're trying to do doesn't really factor into our decision making, right? We're making investment decisions on ability to generate return over time. Do I think that there's an opportunity to do better than we've done historically? Yes, of course, we can be more efficient with our balance sheet. So we highlighted earlier this year that we had $1 billion of extra capital tied up in-house. We've long talked about trying to increase the optionality of our land book, which would be an opportunity for us as well. We're at 50% today -- 51%, sorry. So I think if we can make progress on those fronts, we have an opportunity to continue to generate really strong returns through time. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thank you for the color. Operator : We will take our next question from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Joe Ahlersmeyer : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just a follow-up on that last question. Perhaps if you could just talk if you've got in your mind, an upper limit on the idle cash that you might carry on your balance sheet, going forward? And then also just maybe talk about your appetite for increasing leverage just given the facility in your business? Pablo Shaughnessy : Yes. I don't know that there's -- I wouldn't want to put guardrails around anything we do. Yes, we've been pretty clear and it's 10-plus years now in terms of how we're going to allocate our capital. We've also been, I think, pretty clear that we don't take a point in time assessment of that. We have a business plan and a model that we've created, and we iterate through time that we use to make the decisions on how to invest that capital and just a refresher in the business first and high return. We want to pay a dividend. We use excess capital to buy back stock we'll manage that against leverage. We've reduced the expected leverage in the business. If you think back a decade ago, we said between 30% and 40% gross debt to cap. We adjusted that 20% to 30%. We're under that today. I think you could see us do lots of things. And I wouldn't want to say, well, if we have more than x dollars of cash, we're going to do something different. We'll continue down the same path. We spent time with the Board working through the different capital decisions we make. And I think that's exactly what will be going forward. Joe Ahlersmeyer : Got it. Thanks, Bob. And then just maybe if you could talk about the improvement relative to pre-pandemic in your gross margins and your returns on inventory, if there's a number you could quantify around production improvements and even more specifically, if the actions you've taken getting back into the off-site construction space, if there's anything to call out there? And maybe just an update on how ICG is doing? Ryan Marshall :  Yes. Let me take the ICG piece. We're really pleased with how that business is operating. We have two factories up and operational that are doing well for us, and we're very pleased with what we're getting there. We've talked about once we get some additional factories up and open and it's covering a bigger percentage of the business we'll share more detail about the cycle time gains, the cost savings that we're seeing from that business, but we're really pleased with what that team is doing. In terms of the first part of your question, it... Pablo Shaughnessy : It's interesting. I would tell you, we're -- you're asking if there are productivity gains. If I understood the question correctly, you're asking if there are productivity gains that we've gained by virtue of the pandemic that we might be able to save post pandemic. I would tell you exactly the opposite is true. We have a less efficient business, and it shows up in our cycle times, right? And the supply chain dynamics caused us to lose production efficiency. And you heard Ryan say it a minute ago, we think we've got opportunity to improve from here on that. Joe Ahlersmeyer : That\u2019s great, I appreciate that. Thanks guys. Good luck. Operator : We will take our next question from Alex Barron with Housing Research Center. Your line is open. Alex Barron : Yes. Thanks, guys. Just to ask again on the ICG. Is there any plans to roll this out to more markets near term? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alex, when we made our first acquisition around our off-site our off-site manufacturing efforts. We said we believe we can have up to about eight plants that will impact about 70% of our overall production volume. That's still the path that we're on. We're -- we haven't announced any new openings, but the strategic direction of eight plants over time and 70% of the business still holds firm. Alex Barron : Got it. And I'm not sure if I missed it, but did you guys give your land position and owned an option? Ryan Marshall : I gave the total control, but I give you the owned is 14,000 lots. The option is 110,000 lots for a total control of 214,000 lots. Alex Barron : Got it. And in terms of direction, obviously, a lot of builders, I guess, yourselves included kind of slowdown acquisition of lots at the end of last year, but are you guys seeing the next few months is something that will reaccelerate or just still kind of hold near current levels? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alex, we gave -- we kind of gave our updated land guide, which is at $4 billion, which is a lot of money. It's not an insignificant investment in our overall land portfolio. Roughly half of that is new acquisition. The other half of that spend is on development on lots that we already own. 214,000 lots gives us certainly ample runway and supply for our go-forward business and going back to some of the answers that I gave on similar questions earlier, we're really confident in our land acquisitions team to continue to find good spots, negotiate what we believe are fair in market prices that will continue to help us generate industry-leading returns and gross margins and help us continue to grow the business. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America. Your line is open. Rafe Jadrosich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you just talk about the sort of specific drivers of the quarter-over-quarter step-up in gross margin in the second quarter? And then what drove upside relative to your guidance from a quarter ago? Ryan Marshall : You're meaning sequentially, right? Rafe Jadrosich : Correct. Ryan Marshall : Yes. So we had highlighted that a couple of things influence it relative to our guide. One is we got better pricing on specs than we were projecting. And the second was the mix of communities that we got closings from looked a little bit different than we thought. So you can see from the sales environment that the market was pretty strong. We were able to translate that in the specs that we saw. Really, those are the two primary drivers that's why we called it out, Rafe [ph]. Rafe Jadrosich : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then you've spoken a little bit about the underwriting strategy going forward. How should we think about your option mix going forward? And like what's the longer-term target relative to the current 51%? Pablo Shaughnessy : Yes, we've been pretty clear. We had targeted 50% a year or so ago, we increased that to a target of 70%. We have gotten to a point, I think at the richest, we were at 56%. We walked from about 60,000 lots over the back half of 2022. When you pulled us back down closer to 50%, now we're starting to rebuild again, very large. We had highlighted, we've been able to increase that in this most recent quarter. And again, the target still remains to try to be about 70%. Rafe Jadrosich : Great. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. And I will now turn the call back to Mr. Jim Zeumer for closing remarks. Jim Zeumer : I appreciate everybody joining us on the call today. We're around and available to the remainder of the day if you've got any questions. Otherwise, we'll look forward to speaking with you on our next quarterly call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

A copy of our earnings release and this morning\u2019s presentation slides has been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We\u2019ll post an audio replay of this call later today.  We want to inform everyone that today\u2019s discussion includes forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Jim and good morning. As we will discuss over the next several minutes, PulteGroup reported another quarter of outstanding and, for a number of key metrics, record financial results.  Our financial performance demonstrates once again the importance of PulteGroup\u2019s balanced and differentiated operating model. Leveraging our broad geographic footprint and diversified product offering, we are working to maintain significant market share among all major buyer groups.  At the same time, we are successfully executing both large scale spec and build-to-order homebuilding businesses. Our spec business allows us to more cost efficiently serve first-time buyers, while our build-to-order business caters to move-up and active adult buyers looking to personalize their home location and design features.  Specific to our financial results, I am extremely proud of our entire organization for their efforts in delivering third quarter results that include a 43% increase in orders, industry-leading gross margins of 29.5%, record third quarter earnings of $2.90 per share, and a return on equity that exceeded 30%.  In the quarter, I would highlight our active adult business as an important contributor to our sign-up growth and our gross margin performance. In an operating environment where rising mortgage rates are creating increasing affordability challenges, 47% of our Del Webb purchasers were cash buyers. This is up from 33% just two years ago. Along with largely being cash buyers, these were customers who can afford the premium lots and upgrades that make active adult our highest margin business. Just to demonstrate the brand power of the Del Webb name, in June we opened Del Webb Kensington Ridge in Michigan, not a market you might consider a hotspot for retirees. In a community where base home prices range from $370,000 to north of $600,000, we have already sold 114 houses in just over 100 days. We fully appreciate that to some degree, all buyers are impacted by rising rates and macroeconomic concerns, but buyer groups can absolutely behave differently over the course of a housing cycle. For PulteGroup, we believe being diversified across all buyer groups can enhance both growth and stability.  Beyond our diversification across buyer groups, PulteGroup\u2019s strong third quarter financial performance also benefited from our ability to offer consumers both spec built and build-to-order homes. As we have discussed on prior calls over the past 24 months, we have transitioned our first-time buyer communities to a spec build model to better serve these customers. Looking at our first time business, spec building allows us to maintain a more consistent cadence of starts in those communities, which drives construction efficiencies and is important in working with our trades. More directly to our quarter, having additional inventory available was important given 49% of our sales in the period were spec sales. I would note that 49% spec sales in the quarter is down from 58% in Q1 of this year. I think the decrease in the relative percentage of spec sales in the quarter reflects two interesting dynamics. On one hand, the affordability challenges caused by higher interest rates are pushing some buyers, particularly first-time buyers, to the sidelines for now. On the other hand, more affluent buyers who are less fearful about rates are comfortable contracting for a home where they\u2019ve selected the lot, the floor plan, and the design options. On the construction side, I\u2019m pleased to say that we continued to shorten our production cycle. Just to remind people, pre-COVID our production cycle was approximately 90 work days. At its worst, this number ballooned to 170 days. By the end of the quarter, we had reduced this number to about 140 days. Our teams continue to shave days and weeks off our build cycle and we remain optimistic about our ability to get back below 100 days in 2024. As you would expect, cutting more than a month off of our cycle time has positively impacted our cash flow, which we continue to allocate across our key business priorities. Through the first nine months of 2023, we have invested $3 billion in our business through land acquisition and development. Over this same period, we have returned over $800 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In this most recent quarter, we even took advantage of market conditions to retire $65 million of near term debt at prices just below par.  PulteGroup has delivered outstanding operating and financial performance in the quarter and throughout the first nine months of the year as we have leveraged our strong competitive position to capitalize on buyer demand. It grows increasingly clear that Federal Reserve actions to raise interest rates are having the desired effect of slowing the economy, although the speed of deceleration has been slower than expected given the unprecedented ramp in rates. While arguably not the most supportive economic backdrop, new home demand in 2023 has benefited from a robust jobs market and rising wages, financially resilient consumers and a continuing dearth of supply from the existing home market, and finally as higher rates begin to bite, we have responded with adjustments in product, pricing and incentive programs that successfully address consumers\u2019 biggest pain point, affordability. It\u2019s difficult to know if the Fed is done hiking rates for this economic cycle and trying to guess when they will move to cut rates is challenging, so we will remain disciplined in how we manage our business. We\u2019ll focus on serving our customers, supporting our employees, turning our assets and allocating capital appropriately while maintaining a strong and highly flexible capital position. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed analysis of our Q3 results. Bob? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks Ryan. PulteGroup\u2019s third quarter results add to what has been an exceptional year for the company as we have grown revenues and earnings, generating significant cash flow from operations, lowered our debt, and generally strengthened our entire operating platform. Specific to our third quarter, home sale revenues increased 3% over last year to $3.9 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter reflect a 2% increase in our average sales price to $549,000, in combination with a less than 1% increase in closings to 7,076 homes. The 2% gain in average sales price of homes closed in the quarter was driven by increases of 4% and 6% from move-up and active adult buyers respectively, partially offset by a 3% decrease among first-time buyers. The lower ASP among first-time buyer closings reflects our focus on remaining price competitive as interest rates have moved higher throughout the year. The mix of homes delivered in the third quarter changed just slightly from the prior year as we continue to operate within the range of our stated mix of business. For the quarter, closings among first-time buyers represented 38% of the business, move-up buyers totaled 37%, and active adult buyers represented 25% of the homes closed. In the third quarter of last year, 36% of homes delivered were first-time, 38% were move-up, and 26% were active adult. Net new orders for the third quarter increased 43% over last year to 7.065 homes as we realized year-over-year gains in both units and absorption pace across all buyer groups. Orders among first-time buyers in the third quarter increased 53% over last year to 2,979 homes. The gain among move-up buyers was even greater as net new orders increased 56% to 2,524 homes, and finally on a comparable community count, we realized a double-digit gain in sales among active adult buyers as net new orders for the quarter increased to 1,562 homes.  In the third quarter, we operated from an average of 923 communities, which is up 12% over last year. Adjusting for community count, the monthly absorption pace in the third quarter averaged 2.5 homes, which is up from 2.0 homes per month in the third quarter of last year. As a percentage of beginning backload, our cancellation rate in the third quarter was 9% compared with 8% in the prior year. To be clear, on a unit basis cancellations in the third quarter were down more than 20% from last year, but the relative size of our backlog in each period results in the cancellation rate staying comparable.  Our unit backlog at the end of the quarter was 13,547 homes compared with 17,053 homes at the end of last year\u2019s third quarter. On a dollar basis, the value of our ending backlog was $8.1 billion, down from $10.6 billion in the third quarter of last year. At the end of the third quarter, we had a total of 17,376 homes under construction. This is down 24% from the same period last year as we strategically manage starts and realize the benefits of faster cycle times. Of the homes under construction, 61% were sold and 39% were spec units. As we have stated previously, we are comfortable putting spec units into production, but we are thoughtful about aligning the pace of starts with the pace of sales to help reduce the risk of putting too much inventory on the ground. Consistent with this measured approach to production, of the 6,700 spec homes currently under construction, fewer than 1,000 were finished. Given our Q3 community count of 923, we continue to carry approximately one finished spec per community, which is in line with our operating targets. Based on the homes we have in production and, as importantly, current sales trends, we expect closings in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8,000 homes. Delivering 8,000 homes in the fourth quarter would put us at 29,000 for the full year, which is down slightly from our previous guide for full-year closings to be 29,500 homes. The change in our guide reflects the more challenging affordability conditions resulting from higher rates as well as the slight shift in our mix toward build-to-order homes which won\u2019t deliver until 2024. Given the mix of homes we currently expect to deliver in the fourth quarter, we expect our average sales price on closing to be in the range of $540,000 to $550,000 in the period. Our third quarter home sale gross margin of 29.5% continues to lead the industry as we successfully our turned our assets while still achieving high levels of profitability and driving higher returns on investment. PulteGroup\u2019s reported results benefited from strong margin performance across all buyer groups - first time, move-up, and active adult. Further, as we have talked about on prior calls, our diversified product portfolio is allowing us to capture higher gross margins that are typically available within our move-up and active adult communities. As I would remind everyone, our primary focus is always on driving higher returns on invested capital, but we appreciate margins are an important contributor to achieving such returns. This is why we remain disciplined in where we locate and how we underwrite our communities and how we design and build our houses, and in how we strategically price our homes in the marketplace.  Given the ongoing strength of our margins, we continue to get questions regarding relative margin performance among the larger public builders. I want to quickly address the line of thought that our margins benefit from land positions within our older Del Webb legacy communities. The reality is that the margins for these communities are comparable to the rest of our active adult business, but they are [indiscernible] our aggregate numbers. That being said, I\u2019m pleased to say that we expect to continue delivering high margins as we continue to expect home sale gross margins to be in the range of 29% to 29.5% in the fourth quarter. Given current interest rates, demand and cost dynamics, we would expect to be toward the lower end of this range. SG&A expenses in the third quarter totaled $353 million or 9.1% of home sale of revenues. This compares with prior year SG&A expense of $350 million or 9.2% of home sale revenues. Based on anticipated closing volumes for the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8.8%. In the third quarter, pre-tax income from financial services was $29 million, up from $27.5 million last year. While market conditions remain highly competitive for our financial services operations, the business benefited from a higher capture rate of 84% compared with 77% last year. The large increase in capture rate relates to the expanded use of rate-based incentives, which are executed through our mortgage operations. Looking at our taxes, consistent with our prior guide, our third quarter tax expense was $209 million or an effective tax rate of 24.6%. For the fourth quarter, we continue to guide to a tax rate of 24.5%. PulteGroup\u2019s bottom line results show net income for the quarter of $639 million or $2.90 per share, which is up from prior year net income of $628 million or $2.69 per share.  Given the ongoing financial strength and cash flow generation of our business, we repurchased 3.8 million shares for $300 million in the quarter. This was up from $180 million last year and $250 million in the second quarter of this year.  In the third quarter, we also elected to allocate capital towards paying down a portion of our debt. In total, we retired $65 million of our 2026 and 2027 senior notes through open market transactions at prices slightly below par. Inclusive of these transactions, we\u2019ve lowered our debt-to-capital ratio to 16.5%, which is down 220 basis points from the start of \u201923 and down 600 basis points from the third quarter of \u201922. Adjusting for the $1.9 billion of cash on our balance sheet at quarter end, our net debt to capital ratio was less than 1%.  Beyond buying back our equity and debt in the third quarter, we also invested $1.2 billion in the business through land acquisition and development, which keeps us on track to invest upwards of $4 billion for 2023. Almost two-thirds of our investment in the third quarter was for the development of our existing land assets. Inclusive of our Q3 spend, we ended the quarter with approximately 223,000 lots under control, of which 53% are held via option. We continue to systematically rebuild the optionality of our land pipeline after having walked away from selective land positions in the back half of 2022. As part of this rebuilding process and consistent with our stated strategy of getting more land light, we are expanding our use of different land banking structures. To date, we have completed land banking transactions for approximately 5,000 lots. Going forward, we will look to use such land banking facilities in order to create optionality in situations where the underlying seller requires a bulk sale. It\u2019s a disciplined process as we work to balance land costs, returns and risk, but we are gaining momentum in our efforts. We are also getting more questions on our land pipeline, so let me add that about one-third of the lots we have under control are developed and we continue to develop most of the lots that we acquire. As a large homebuilder, assuming you\u2019re confident in the third party\u2019s ability to consistently deliver developed lots on time, the decision to purchase finished lots versus raw dirt comes down to return. Finished lots cost more but can turn faster, whereas the lower cost of undeveloped lots can drive higher margins, but the land is on balance sheet for a little longer. In all of our land transactions, we assess how best to drive higher risk-adjusted returns and to find opportunities and deals for finished and/or undeveloped lots. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Ryan Marshall : As you would anticipate, given our 43% increase in net new orders, we saw strong demand throughout the quarter. Q3 displayed more typical seasonality than we have experienced in the three years since COVID as absorption pace eased as we moved through the quarter. Demand has been a little choppier in the first few weeks of October with more volatility in the day-to-day sales numbers.  I\u2019m sure for some buyers, higher rates have pushed affordability just that much further away, while others may be worried about their jobs. For other buyers, global unrest may simply have them thinking of other things. We are fortunate to have an experienced operating team that will make adjustments if and when needed.  On a year-over-year basis, for the first nine months of 2023, we have increased net income by $156 million and increased earnings by share by 17%. Over the same period, we\u2019ve increased our cash position by approximately $1.6 billion while dropping our net debt to capital ratio effectively to zero. Based on guidance that we\u2019ve given, we look forward to delivering exceptional full year results for 2023. From population growth and demographics to supply dynamics and the tremendous opportunity for wealth creation through home ownership, we are bullish on long term housing demand. Over the near term, however, we fully appreciate the affordability challenges being created by higher mortgage rates and the potential impacts from an economic slowdown the Federal Reserve is hoping to bring about. As such, we remain disciplined in how we operate our business particularly as it relates to investing in land, the pace of production, the allocation of capital, and the quality of homes and experience we deliver to our customers. We have a clear and successful operating model against which we have been executing for over a decade, so decision making throughout the organization is consistent and actions are implemented quickly. This strong organizational foundation along with tremendous financial strength has PulteGroup well positioned for ongoing success. In closing, I want to thank the entire team at PulteGroup for their tremendous efforts in delivering for our home buyers, our shareholders, and each other. I am so proud of what you accomplish every day. Let me turn the call back to Jim so we can begin Q&A. James Zeumer : Thanks Ryan. We\u2019re now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.  Abbie, we\u2019re ready to open for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Your line is open. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, good morning guys. I wanted to first just ask about the cycle time numbers - you talked about 140, trying to get down below 100 next year, so that\u2019s more than a month off. What specifically, Ryan, needs to happen for those numbers to go down? Where are the best and most obvious lever points? Ryan Marshall : Yes Carl, so a lot of the work has already been done and what we\u2019re seeing is some of the homes that are delivering now, and maybe better said, the homes that are starting now are on cycle times that will yield that overall cycle time of below 100 days, so it\u2019s really about getting the older stuff that\u2019s been in the pipeline, that\u2019s got longer cycle times, that as those numbers close out, I think we\u2019ll see our overall cycle times come in line with that target of 100 days. Carl Reichardt : Right, thanks Ryan. Then you mentioned the choppiness in October, and I wonder if you could expand a little on that and talk a little bit, maybe about performance among the three segments in the month so far or particular markets, and then also from a cancellation perspective, if that\u2019s beginning to sort of impact you in October too. Thanks. Ryan Marshall : Yes Carl, happy to talk on October. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve seen sales in October, while good, they\u2019ve been a little bit choppier than--you know, the day-to-day kind of numbers have been a little choppier. I think the biggest thing that I\u2019d want you to hear is that similar to what we saw in the third quarter, we actually have seen a return to what we would consider seasonal type sign-up trends that we experienced pre-COVID, and we\u2019ve seen that continue into October. On an absorption rate, the numbers that we\u2019re seeing on absorptions per community are pretty similar to what we saw in 2018 and 2019 pre-COVID levels, which were pretty healthy, so all things considered, we feel pretty good about the continued ongoing desire for home ownership. It\u2019s not lost on any of you out there listening, rates matter, and there has been a lot of rate movement over the last 30 days, and so I think the consumer, all things considered, has handled that really well. Carl Reichardt : Great, I appreciate the color. Thanks, fellows. Operator : We will take our next question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open. Matthew Bouley : Hey, good morning guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a question around some of the comments you made at the top, Ryan, around addressing affordability and some of the challenges you\u2019re seeing, particularly with the first-time buyer. Any additional elaboration on what you\u2019re doing with incentives and rate buy-downs, and what\u2019s working and not working as we get into September and October, and sort of the margin implications of all that? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes Matt, thanks for the question. We continue to use the permanent 30-year buy-down as probably our most powerful incentive. Right now, we\u2019ve got national incentives that offer 5.75% on a 30-year fixed, so I think given rates today on the open market would be over 8%, to be able to get a new home in a great location of the quality and design features that we have at 5.75%, I think is pretty powerful. I\u2019ll remind everybody, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve simply redistributed incentives that we\u2019ve historically offered toward cabinets and countertops and things of that nature, we\u2019ve redirected those to interest rate incentives, and I think that\u2019s the--you know, that\u2019s been the most powerful thing for that buyer group. Matthew Bouley : Got it, okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Then secondly, just one on stick and brick costs - you know, just as you\u2019re addressing these issues and presumably there is margin pressure out of that, and the housing market has evolved here, what are you guys doing around construction costs, labor, sort of ability to push back on all that? How should we think about that over these next few months? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes, well you know, look - inflation is real, and we\u2019ve previously talked about something in the neighborhood of 8% to 9% year-over-year inflation, which I think is part of the reason we\u2019re in the rate environment that we\u2019re in as the Fed\u2019s trying to get a handle on that. What we\u2019ve seen on our cost to build is on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re actually flat. Now, that\u2019s a lot of commodity and material and labor increase in a number of categories that\u2019s been offset by lumber save, so headline is we\u2019re flat on a price per square foot to build year-over-year, but it\u2019s a lot of increases in material and labor offset by lumber. Matthew Bouley : Got it, thanks Ryan. Good luck, guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just wanted to kind of take a step back and understand some of the dynamics. You talk about October being choppy, but at the same time it sounds like more in line with seasonality pre-COVID, and you also--you know, the flipside of that is with volume, you\u2019re putting out a gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter maybe a touch down from 3Q. Can you just give us a sense of the level of incentives, if through your own offerings in October or maybe even more broadly in the marketplace, do you feel like incentives have started to come up over the last couple of months because certainly, I guess in the near term, you\u2019re looking for a similar gross margin, and maybe just more broadly how you feel the market is reacting to September and October? Ryan Marshall : Yes Mike, I\u2019ll take part of that and then I\u2019ll have Bob talk about the incentive load. As demonstrated by our orders in the quarter, we had 43% growth in new orders and it was a number of over 7,000, so I think we\u2019ve clearly demonstrated that we\u2019ve got the ability to sell homes. You\u2019ve heard me talk about not being margin proud, but at the same time, we\u2019re not going to give away price and incentives that we don\u2019t have to, and I think we did exactly that in the third quarter and we\u2019d continue to focus on making sure that we\u2019re turning the asset and we\u2019re getting the number of absorptions that we need in every single community to deliver the best return on invested capital that we can. Look, I think it was a great quarter. We\u2019re happy with how sign-ups performed in October - you know, you heard me kind of talk about that on the question that Carl asked, so I won\u2019t repeat it. Then Bob, if you can, maybe just talk a little bit about the incentive load. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes Mike, you know, you can see in our data we\u2019ve got about a 6% incentive load - that\u2019s $35,000 a unit, rough math. That actually is down 10 basis points from Q2 of this year. It is certainly up - it was 2.2% last year, but the sales environment that led to the closings in Q3 of last year was dramatically different, so you can see kind of a normalization here at 6%.  I think you can take from our margin guidance for Q3 what we see closing in the fourth quarter, and we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility into that at this moment, will not be significantly impactful. I would highlight that we\u2019ve given a continuation of that same guide at 29.5% on margins. We have told you we\u2019re going to be at the lower end of that, so there is some cost to this interest rate environment. Michael Rehaut : Right - no, appreciate that, Bob. I guess secondly, maybe bigger picture conceptually, you talked about earlier in the call questions around your higher gross margin versus your peer group. When you think about the 6% today versus 2% a year ago, and I don\u2019t know if that 6%, I want to say it\u2019s a little bit above your longer term average maybe around 3%, how does that square with the level of gross margins you\u2019re generating today, and if you think about over the next couple years, we\u2019ve heard different things from different builders about maybe increasing hurdle rates from underwriting about--you know, just thinking about higher cost land perhaps might flow through over the next couple years. You know, if incentive levels stay where they are, would that suggest kind of a moderation a little bit from the current level of gross margins, or how should we think conceptually about the next couple of years directionally for this metric? Ryan Marshall : Yes Mike, our crystal ball at this point, a couple of years out, we\u2019re not there yet. We\u2019re still kind of focused on Q4. We\u2019ve given a guide for that quarter, when we get to kind of the end of Q4, we\u2019ll certainly give a full year guide for the balance of 2024, but maybe the thing I do want to address is the incentive load that we currently have, that is allowing us to offer incentives on the interest rate, that\u2019s been in our margin guide and our results for the entire year. You\u2019re seeing the impact of offering below-market interest rates as an incentive. It\u2019s been in Q2 results, it was in our Q3 results and it\u2019s in our Q4 guide, so no guidance about what margins direction will be beyond Q4 of this year, but that\u2019s all embedded in our--you know, to this point, everything that we\u2019ve been doing, that\u2019s embedded in the results that we\u2019ve delivered and the guide that we\u2019ve given. Michael Rehaut : Appreciate it. Operator : We will take our next question from Joe Ahlersmeyer from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Joe Ahlersmeyer : Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. I appreciate the data point about the active adult community in Michigan - hopefully snow removal is included in that HOA fee! Ryan Marshall : In fact it is, Joe. Joe Ahlersmeyer : Good.  Look, market conditions, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to determine the margin volume and price into next year. I think it\u2019s an under-appreciated element of your business. Of course, the composition of that can vary, right, within the definition of success, but you are obviously appropriately acknowledging the headwinds here. Maybe if you could just talk instead to the return headwind from this, instead of either the absorption headwind or the gross margin headwind, just how are you thinking about returns on capital, and then similarly returns on inventory if interest rates remain high? You\u2019re basically at net zero debt now. Just how you\u2019re thinking about ROE relative to ROI. Ryan Marshall : Yes Joe, thanks for the question, and I\u2019ll do my best to give you an answer. For the last decade, maybe even going on 12 years, the way that we\u2019ve operated the business has been with a singular focus on delivering the best possible return on invested capital that we can. Given the capital intensive nature of this business, for us we think that\u2019s the best way to make decisions and to operationalize our platform in a way that delivers high return on assets, high return on equity, whatever metric you want to look at. I think we\u2019ve clearly done that. I highlighted in my prepared remarks that for the trailing 12 months, we delivered return on equity over 30%, and part of that derived from running a good business but also a very thoughtful and disciplined way in allocating capital, which includes things beyond just buying land and building homes. We are paying a dividend, we\u2019ve bought back near 45% of the company over the last 10 to 12 years that we\u2019ve had our share buyback program in place, and we just highlighted this quarter we opportunistically took advantage of the opportunity to buy some debt in, near term debt in that was trading below par. You know, I think maybe the best way I can describe it, Joe, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on buying assets in great spots, turning those in a way that delivers high return on invested capital, and one of the other things that I think can also continue to give us flexibility and return-enhancing leverage is moving our land options to 70%, so. We sit at 53% today, we\u2019ve given you kind of a long term target of 70%. We\u2019ve got things in place and work underway that will help us get there. Joe Ahlersmeyer : Appreciate all those thoughts, Ryan. As a follow-up, just maybe on the comment around matching starts to orders, should we interpret that as roughly 7,000 starts in the fourth quarter, or is that more of a comment on what the fourth quarter orders look like, that\u2019s what your starts might look like? Ryan Marshall : Yes, fourth quarter starts will be more reflective of order trends that we\u2019re seeing in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re starting more spec than we historically have. We\u2019ve highlighted that we\u2019ve completely moved our first-time business to a spec business, so some of that\u2019s predetermined based on what we saw in the third quarter and what we would anticipate. But we\u2019re just not going to get into kind of a position where we\u2019ve got a build-up of spec inventory that creates pressure to do things that are unnatural on the pricing, but we are going to put some units in the ground to have those ready for Q1. You saw us do that last year, in the back half of last year that set us up for a really strong Q1 of 2023, so. You know, I\u2019d want you to hear balanced approach, inventories going into the ground, we\u2019re going to have it ready for Q1, but we are going to be responsive to some of the headwinds that we\u2019ve acknowledged are out there in this current rate environment. Joe Ahlersmeyer : Sounds good, thanks a lot. Operator : We will take our next question from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Stephen Kim : Yes, thanks very much, guys. Great job, exciting times. Ryan, in your opening remarks, you sort of talked about some of the reasons why--you know, some of the ways in which buyers seem to be responding to the rates, and you sort of contrasted or laid out that there\u2019s a psychological component, maybe math versus mental. I\u2019m curious--and you talked about the role of buy-downs in that, so my first question relates to how you think--let\u2019s do it this way. What percent of your buyers are taking a rate buy-down, and when you\u2019re negotiating these buy-downs, you\u2019ve talked about the 5.75% through the end o this year, it looks like, where are you setting new lots, because I imagine you\u2019re negotiating those now for the next batch, where are you setting those lots from a contracted rate perspective? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, hey Stephen, it\u2019s Bob. It\u2019s an evergreen process, honestly. We are buying contracts typically weekly, actually, and they are market-based. We set the pricing on that, and that determines the price to us to offer that value to the consumer, so the rate that Ryan talked about is a negotiated price and essentially we fill the cost of being able to provide that contract rate to our consumer. There is an upfront fee for purchasing the contract and then there is the rate buy-down as part of that, and so it\u2019s a--you know, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re buying now for three and six months from now. These are contracts that we enter into that we expect to build, candidly, within 30 days, and typically we\u2019re filling them within a week, so it\u2019s a--you know, it\u2019s very market responsive. As rates go up, it\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve offered has moved up a little bit. We\u2019ve increased our cost as part of that to a degree, so it\u2019s a process we\u2019ve been working through for, gosh, 10 or 11 months now since we put it in place, and we\u2019ve found it works pretty well. Stephen Kim : Just so I\u2019m understanding that, it sounds like what you\u2019re talking about is you have a forward purchase commitment that you\u2019re doing on a relatively short term basis, but then you\u2019re also layering on top of that an individual rate buy-down, sort of ad hoc, if you will. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: These are 30-year rate buy-downs for the consumer. Ryan Marshall : Stephen, the other thing that I\u2019d maybe just add to your conversation is some buyers, you know, they take the available incentives that we have that get them all the way to 5.75%. There are other buyers that decide that they don\u2019t need to go all the way to 5.75% and they\u2019d like to have a little bit higher rate and use some of the other incentive money that we\u2019re offering for other things that they see value in. We\u2019re seeing about 80% to 85% of our buyers are getting some form of incentive towards interest rates. That doesn\u2019t mean everybody will go to 5.75%. Just some fraction of our total sales end up in that very lowest category.  The big headline is that we\u2019ve got the tools out there and our sales team has got the tools out there to help individually solve what each and every buyer needs to make the transaction work for them. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Maybe to put a finer point on that, as Ryan said, 80% to 85% of the people have an incentive program, only 25% of the business in the quarter was through that national campaign that you asked about, so. Those are targeted to specific inventory units typically, but we offer incentives to all of our consumers - we always have, and as Ryan has stated already today, the vast majority of those incentives now across all of our buyers is financing-oriented. Stephen Kim : Yes, okay. That was really helpful. Appreciate all the nuances there. My second question relates to getting back to sort of the seasonality. It sounds like you\u2019ve acknowledged that seasonality is sort of coming back into the business. In the fourth quarter, it\u2019s a little weird, right, because the housing market kind of generally slows, particularly in the last six weeks of the year, and I\u2019m curious as to your posture as you assess the buyers. Are you anticipating--do you generally think that there\u2019s relatively more inelasticity on the part of the buyer, or relatively less elasticity might be a better way of saying it, so that it causes you maybe not to push so aggressively on incentives to try to keep up sales momentum in the last six weeks of the year, kind of like pushing on a string. Is that a reasonable way to be thinking about how you\u2019re likely to approach the market over the next six weeks--I\u2019m sorry, in the last six weeks of the year? Then lastly, regarding risk, you had talked about wanting to evaluate all of your land actions in terms of risk adjusted returns, but you\u2019re also running at a super low net debt to cap, and I\u2019m curious if you move to lower risk through increased incentive--you know, increased land banking, would it be reasonable to think you\u2019ll also carry increased leverage than you currently are today? Ryan Marshall : Yes Stephen, we are at a very--we\u2019re at a lower leverage rate than what we\u2019ve historically run at. I think that really more than anything, it\u2019s a testament to the strength of the business. We\u2019ve been operating really well and we have been generating a lot of cash. We\u2019ve really been touching kind of all the critical parts of our capital allocation philosophy. We\u2019ve invested a lot of money into land and land development, we\u2019ve been paying our dividend, we\u2019ve bought back the highest single quarter spend in shares this year in the third quarter at $300 million, and we bought back some debt, and with that, we still grew the cash balance, so I think it really demonstrates how strong the business is operating. In terms of your question on pricing and discounts and elasticity or inelasticity, we\u2019re going to continue to price and set incentives at a level that we think is appropriate for the market. We\u2019re going to be responsive, we\u2019re not going to be margin proud. At the same time, I think we\u2019ve got a good understanding of what value is, and you shouldn\u2019t expect to see kind of the national year-end blowout, red tag kind of screaming baby sale from us - I don\u2019t think that helps the consumer. But I think you\u2019re seeing us put the appropriate incentive load such that we\u2019re turning the asset, we\u2019re turning the inventory, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re getting a minimum of two sales per active community, which is kind of the level that I think you need to be at in production homebuilding to deliver the types of return on assets, return on inventory, return on invested capital that we want. Stephen Kim : Perfect, appreciate that. Thanks guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Ken Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open. Ken Zener : Good morning everybody. Ryan Marshall : Morning Ken. Ken Zener : Just want to delve into the option impact on your margins. I think you\u2019ve been saying options have been about 19% of your ASP. Is that still where we\u2019re at in terms of the options? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: We\u2019ve talked about our options and lot premiums being a consistent driver of value. It\u2019s part of the way we go to market. We think it\u2019s one of the strengths of our sales process. In the most recent quarter, that was $107,000, it\u2019s up $3,000 sequentially and year-over-year, so that is still part of our sales operation. It\u2019s how we go to market, and yes, 20% is roughly where we are. I wouldn\u2019t expect that to change as long as market dynamics stay where they are. Ken Zener : Right, and so I guess--you know, what we talked about since last quarter was options are obviously higher margin, one can imply that\u2019s accounting for historically that 300 or 400 basis point lift of gross margins versus peers, so as that option mix, can you kind of relate--you know, what is the cost of or what was the drag specifically for all these mortgage rate buy-downs? You know, 5.75% versus the 8% now, what is the net impact on your gross margin? I realize it\u2019s part of incentives, but if you could quantify that. Then what is the actual distribution of that? It seems like an active adult paying cash doesn\u2019t need it, so is that largely occurring in the first-time buyer? I heard the 80%, but I\u2019m just trying to understand that spread of usage relative to these options, which are structurally a good tailwind for you. That\u2019s one, and then second, your mention of finished lots, very interesting because you\u2019re return focused, so I think the street\u2019s too focused on margin, not focused enough on turns. Did you have, or what percent of closings in the quarter came from finished lots, and what\u2019s the margin impact of that as well? I appreciate you answering those two sets of questions. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Ken, there\u2019s a lot there. Let me start with--I had highlighted this before, our incentive load is about 6%, $35,000, so that would tell you 6.3%, something like that, and again I think we\u2019ve highlighted the majority of that incentive is rate buy-down for financing support, so I think that\u2019s the answer to your first question. I apologize -your second question was, I think what percentage of our-- Ken Zener : Right, you were talking returns, right? You\u2019re a return-based company, even though the street and you guys focus a lot on margins. To the extent the first-time buyer, more spec, finished lots so you get better terms, you guys mentioned finished lots, I believe for the first time, so what is the impact of the finished lots? Are you closing finished lots? What type of margin impact is that? Ryan Marshall : Ken, it\u2019s Ryan, I\u2019ll jump in on that. We haven\u2019t sliced the bologna quite that thin, and I won\u2019t attempt to do it on this call. We are a return-focused company. There is no change there. I think we\u2019ve been the purveyors of the message, we don\u2019t focus on margin, it\u2019s a component of the overall operating model. We\u2019re focused on return, and depending on the number of units we sell in a particular community and how quickly you turn the asset, if you do that fast enough, then it can offset and you can allow for lower gross margins. If you\u2019re getting a lot just in time and somebody else is developing it and carrying it, and we can build in the hundred days that we\u2019re talking about, it allows us to run a high returning business at a lower margin. That\u2019s not a new concept, that\u2019s exactly what we do, and it\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll continue to do. Operator : As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. We will take our next question from John Lovallo with UBS. Your line is open. John Lovallo : Good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, so rates at 8% today, you guys are buying down to 5.75%. Can you just remind us, last quarter when rates were closer to 7%, what level you were buying down to? Ryan Marshall : Yes John, we were--I think the lowest we were was 5%, 5.25% at a national level. We had some specific markets that may have been sub-5% at 4.99%, but basically as you\u2019ve seen the headline rate move from 7.5% to 8%, you\u2019ve seen our promotional rate move up by that same 50 basis points. John Lovallo : Okay, and you would anticipate probably taking that same strategy as we move forward, if rates were to move up? Ryan Marshall : I think generally, that\u2019s a good rule of thumb. I mean, there is--I think practically speaking, there\u2019s a limit to how much money you can throw at the rate relative to what the headline number is. John Lovallo : Makes sense, and then the second question is just on community count, how you\u2019re thinking about that through the remainder of this year, and maybe any initial thoughts as we move into next year. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, I think very consistent with what we\u2019ve said, we think we\u2019ll be up 5% to 10% over fourth quarter of last year. Ryan Marshall : And then we haven\u2019t given anything for \u201924 yet, John, but as we\u2019ve said in the past, you can see the capital that we\u2019ve spent, for the land that we\u2019ve spent this year, a pretty good indicator of what community count will be in the future, or you can use as a proxy for what community count can turn into in the future. John Lovallo : Got it, thank you guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Dahl : Morning, thanks for taking my questions. Ryan, just to pick up on one of your last responses in terms of the practical limit on how much you can throw at the rate buy-down. I mean, we\u2019ve heard different things from different builders, depending on whether you\u2019re doing fewer buy-downs versus the forward purchase commitments which I think you alluded to earlier, and kind of what is and isn\u2019t considered seller contributions, can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on the details of how you\u2019re executing in the case of going down to 5.75%, how you\u2019re executing that? Is it--like, how much is allocated towards the forward purchase commitment versus the pure points, and do you consider the purchase commitments and the cost of that as part of your seller contributions? Ryan Marshall : Yes, so I don\u2019t want to give away all of our trade secrets on that, but suffice it to say there are different rules based on who is--depending on which government agency rules you\u2019re using for that mortgage program. For the upfront fees that we\u2019re paying on a forward commitment, because those are done prior to having a home under contract, those fees do not count toward seller contribution; but there are additional incentives that have to be applied to the deal--that do have to be applied to the deal once the home\u2019s under contract, those do certainly count towards the seller contribution, so to get to 5.75%, you\u2019ve got some fees on the front end, you\u2019ve got some fees on the back end. We do look at them in the aggregate, and those are the numbers that you\u2019re hearing Bob talk about. Michael Dahl : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then my follow-up is if we think about the movement in rates, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve looked at it this way, and I\u2019ll ask it in a historical context year-to-date, if you look at your year-to-date orders or closings, maybe let\u2019s focus on closings, have you run an analysis of how many of those buyers just wouldn\u2019t have qualified at today\u2019s rates versus the rates that you were able to get them year-to-date? Ryan Marshall : No, we haven\u2019t run that analysis, no. I would highlight that no matter the rate that we\u2019re offering, we qualify the buyer on the 30-year, so a lot of the incentives that we\u2019ve been doing have been 30-year fixed rate, so that is the rate we\u2019re qualifying, but in the case that you do a temporary buy-down, the buyer is qualified at what the permanent 30-year rate will be. I think everybody knows that, but I think it\u2019s worth highlighting because we don\u2019t--none of us wants to see the industry back in a situation that we were in, in 2008. Michael Dahl : Right. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Alan Ratner of Zelman and Associates. Your line is open. Alan Zelman : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for the info so far. Switching gears a little bit, I guess what I\u2019d like to hear your opinion on is maybe what opportunities could potentially come about from this recent, I guess, softening or choppiness that you\u2019re describing. Your balance sheet is obviously in fantastic shape, so is pretty much the rest of the public industry, but we are hearing anecdotes of AD&C capital tightening up for private operators and land developers, and we\u2019re hearing build-for-rent deals potentially falling out of favor here. Have you started to see any increase in either distressed or opportunities that you feel like you might be able to take advantage of, if these current conditions persist for a handful of quarters? Ryan Marshall : Yes Alan, I think we\u2019re hearing the same things that you are, particularly on maybe availability of capital or the cost of capital on the land development side. There\u2019s definitely, I think, some strain or tightness in that arena. I think that certainly might continue to create an opportunity the longer that we stay in a high rate environment. I think it\u2019s also a great opportunity for us to take market share. With our mortgage company, the size of our balance sheet, the ability to be active in the capital markets, I think it gives us an opportunity to do things that smaller local builders and maybe private builders can\u2019t, so I think there is certainly a market share opportunity there as well. We\u2019ve made build-to-rent a small piece of our business. We\u2019ve got good relationships with national partners that we\u2019re building some percentage of our annual deliveries for those operators, and I think we\u2019ve talked extensively about that, that it will continue to be an arrow in our operational quiver.  Look - I\u2019m really, really confident and pleased with the way we\u2019re operating. The health of the business, the volume that we\u2019re selling in kind of the core operations, and then when you go to the balance sheet, I think we\u2019re set up to do a lot of great things that will continue to set us up for success down the road. Alan Zelman : That\u2019s helpful, Ryan. Then I guess other builders have kind of put out an absorption target that they manage their business to, that tends to be maybe more the spec guys, entry level, where volume is certainly more of a consideration. But I\u2019m curious, when you think about your price outlook and your margin profile and where your incentives are currently running at, right now you\u2019re absorption pace is you\u2019re probably going to be in the mid-2s somewhere. Is there a level where, if that pace dips below, that you would get much more aggressive on incentives, discounts, and even adjust base prices again? What would that level look like? Ryan Marshall : Yes Alan, it\u2019s a good question. The thing that I talk about with our operators, and I spend a lot of time in the field in our communities, in our division offices talking about exactly this, the mantra that we have inside the company is a minimum of two sales in every community. Now, certainly we have certain price points in communities that sell way more than two per community, but as a production homebuilder, it\u2019s hard to have an active store that does less than two, you just--you know, you can\u2019t make the returns work to the level of our expectations.  Below two per active community, that\u2019s where we start looking at, hey, we are positioned right, do we have the right incentives, do we have the right pricing, do we have the right product, are we going after the right consumer? There\u2019s a number of those levers that we pull, but it nets out to for this quarter, we were 2.5, but that two per community is kind of the level that we look at. Operator : We will take our final question from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning everyone, and Ryan, the screaming baby sale got me - I think that kid\u2019s probably in high school or college by now. Ryan Marshall : We\u2019re going to the way-back machine, Truman. Truman Patterson : Exactly, exactly. You all--I\u2019m trying to understand, your orders for entry level were performing well in the third quarter - I think you said up, like, 53% year-over-year, but then you mentioned some more cautious commentary about that buyer. I\u2019m just hoping maybe big picture, if you could help us think through the monthly incentives needed for that buyer cohort versus you mentioned active adult, maybe move-up, more affluent, not needing quite as much. I\u2019m just hoping you can help us just kind of understand these bigger trends that you\u2019re seeing near term. Ryan Marshall : Yes Truman, look, I think we\u2019re really pleased with what our first-time business is doing. We\u2019ve invested in it, and we\u2019ve said our target was to get it to kind of 40% of our business, and we\u2019ve done that. I think you\u2019ve seen not only growth in absorptions but growth in communities, and the business is about where we\u2019d like it to be. On one hand, that buyer doesn\u2019t have a home to sell, they\u2019re not locked into a low interest rate that they\u2019re reluctant to get rid of, so I think that\u2019s the positive with that first-time buyer. In terms of the headwinds, I think it\u2019s obvious - it\u2019s 8% interest rates, and that\u2019s a buyer that\u2019s got a down payment, hopefully, either they\u2019ve saved it or it\u2019s been gifted to them by parents, and then they\u2019re going and getting a 30-year mortgage and they\u2019re working on what they can afford based on their wages. The good news is wages are going up, which is helping affordability, but beyond rate-rate-rate, there\u2019s probably not a bunch more that I could add in terms of the first-time buyer. Maybe just the last thing on the overall rate environment, look, high rates aren\u2019t good for the consumer, they\u2019re not good for housing, they\u2019re not good for the broader economy, but we\u2019re all kind of playing in the same environment and with the quality of the management team that we have and the way that we\u2019re operating this company, I think we\u2019ve proven that we\u2019ve got the tools and the operational flexibility to be successful in any environment. This most recent quarter is a great example of that. Truman Patterson : Okay, perfect. Then Ryan, you mentioned adjusting product given the higher rates. I\u2019m hoping you could elaborate on what all that entails for Pulte specifically. Then if I\u2019m reading between the lines, spec sales were about 49% of your overall bucket this quarter - that\u2019s a pretty good run rate that you all expect going forward? Ryan Marshall : Yes, so in terms of product, Truman, the one great thing about our product portfolio is we offer a lot of flexibility to scale up, scale down. We offer structural options that allow a smaller floor plan with added square footage in the form of loft or additional flex space. We\u2019ve got the ability to take a base floor plan, scale it up or scale it down, and we\u2019re seeing buyers use that flexibility to help address some of the affordability challenges that are out there. In our--the way that we sell options, we see buyers pick the things that they see value in, and we\u2019re also seeing buyers make trade-offs in terms of how they spend those dollars, in terms of cabinets, countertops, upgrades, etc.  The last piece of your question, Truman, remind me again? Truman Patterson : Your spec strategy, should we kind of assume that it\u2019s pretty much stable from here, that you\u2019re targeting about half the business perhaps as spec? Ryan Marshall : Yes, roughly. I think that\u2019s a good go-forward run rate. It\u2019s higher than what we experienced pre-COVID - that\u2019s mostly reflective of the size of our first-time business and entirely moving that to spec. We did highlight this quarter, 49% - that\u2019s down from about 60% earlier in the year, so we feel pretty good about that performance in the spec business. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Jim Zeumer for closing remarks. James Zeumer : Okay, appreciate everybody\u2019s time today. Sorry we couldn\u2019t get through to all the questions, but we\u2019re certainly available over the remainder of the day for follow-up, and we\u2019ll look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to welcome Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin the call. Jim, over to you. Jim Zeumer : Thanks, Mandeep. Good morning, and let me welcome participants to today\u2019s call. We look forward to discussing PulteGroup\u2019s strong fourth quarter and full-year financial results, the period ended December 31, 2203. I\u2019m joined on today\u2019s call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO, Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO, and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning\u2019s presentation slides, have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We\u2019ll post an audio replay of this call later today. . Please note that consistent with this morning's earnings release, we'll be discussing our debt ratio on both a gross and net basis. A reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financials is included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. And finally, I want to alert everyone that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'm excited to speak with you today about PulteGroup's outstanding fourth quarter and full-year financial results. Over the past few years, we have faced macro challenges ranging from COVID, to supply chain disruptions, to skyrocketing mortgage rates. Through it all, we've remained disciplined and consistent in running our operations, but when needed, have quickly adjusted key business practices to position PulteGroup for ongoing success. The benefits of this approach can be seen in the strength of our reported results. Bob will detail our Q4 performance, so let me highlight several of our key operating and financial achievements for the full year of 2023. By strategically increasing our spec production, we had more inventory available to meet the demand of first time home buyers and those consumers worried about mortgage rate volatility. Increased house inventory was a critical support to PulteGroup delivering 28,600 homes in 2023, and record home sale revenues of $15.6 billion. In the face of increased costs for land, labor, and materials, we carefully managed product offerings, pricing, incentives, and absorption paces to maintain high profitability, while ensuring we continue to turn our assets. The result, we reported outstanding full-year gross margins of 29.3%, which helped drive a 6% increase in earnings per share to a record $11.72 per share, and a 27% return on equity. We also continue to efficiently increase our land pipeline as we completed transactions to put approximately 40,000 new lots under control. Inclusive of these lots, 53% of our total land pipeline is under option, either with the land sellers or through our expanding land banking structures. Since making the decision to expand our use of land banking starting 15 months ago, we have placed approximately 25 communities representing $1.5 billion worth of future land and development spend into such structures. And finally, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we invested $4.3 billion into the business through land acquisition and development spend in 2023, and returned $1.2 billion to investors through share repurchases, dividends, and debt paydown. Inclusive of our 2023 spend, we have repurchased almost half of the 2013 shares outstanding since initiating the program over a decade ago.  By remaining consistent in our business practices and making market-responsive adjustments were needed, we reported another year of exceptional financial results. I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for their tireless efforts and support in delivering superior homes and experiences to our home buyers, while providing outstanding financial returns to our investors. Consistent with the broader housing market, we saw homebuying demand being negatively impacted during the early part of the fourth quarter, as 30-year mortgage rates increase toward their 2023 peak of 8%. We then saw buyer sentiment and demand improved, as mortgage rates finally rolled over, ultimately dropping more than 100 basis points as we moved through November and December. The decline in rates helped drive our December net new orders and absorption pace to be the highest month in the quarter. The increased homebuying activity in December was an important driver of the 57% increase in our Q4 net new orders, and demonstrates the desire for home ownership remains high across all buyer groups. It remains our view that the long-term outlook for new home construction is extremely positive. A structural shortage of housing caused by years of underbuilding has only been exacerbated by a lack of resale inventory as owners are financially and/or emotionally locked into their low rate mortgages. While the lack of existing home inventory will resolve itself over time, we believe that land entitlement and labor availability challenges mean it will be difficult to correct for the many years of underbuilding in this country. Given our constructive views on the outlook for housing demand, we are investing in our operations, with the goal of growing unit volumes by 5% to 10% annually. Our decision to walk away from option locks as interest rates increased in 2022, will impact our community openings in 2024, leading to our growth this year being closer to the lower end of this range, as we expect closings of approximately 30,000 homes in 2024.  For those of you who have followed PulteGroup\u2019s story for the past few years, you know it's never been about growth for growth's sake. Our focus is always on investing in our business to build shareholder value. So, our objective is to grow our volumes while maintaining high returns on equity. To accomplish this, we must continue to intelligently invest in high quality and high returning projects, while continuing to invest in our own assets through the ongoing repurchase of our stock. As we have demonstrated for much of the past decade, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows that will allow us to fund our business investment, pay our dividend, and return excess capital to our shareholders, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and flexibility. Our expectation of continued financial success is reflected in this morning's announcement that our board approved a $1.5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. With many forecasting interest rates to fall, the economy to stay relatively healthy, and conditions in the job market to remain favorable, there are certainly reasons to be optimistic about housing demand in the coming years.  Let me now turn over the call to Bob for a review of our fourth quarter results. Bob? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan. Good morning. As Ryan mentioned in his comments, market conditions changed meaningfully as the fourth quarter progressed and as mortgage rates began to fall. Our reported financial results for the period were influenced by these evolving market dynamics, so I'll note any important areas of impact in my prepared remarks. Wholesale revenues in the fourth quarter were $4.2 billion, compared with $5 billion in the prior year. Our lower home sale revenues for the period primarily reflect a 14% decrease in closings to 7,615 homes, along with a 2% decrease in our average sales price to $547,000. I would highlight that our fourth quarter closings came in about 5% below our previous guide, as sales early in the quarter were negatively impacted by higher mortgage rates and the general softening in overall buyer demand. As Ryan noted, homebuying demand accelerated in the back half of the quarter, but sales, particularly sales of finished spec homes that would close in the quarter, finished below our assumptions. We could have captured incremental sales and closing value by offering higher incentives, but we didn't see that as a worthwhile tradeoff. Given that buyer trends have remained positive in January, I think we made the right choices as we have inventory available to meet the stronger demand.  Our mix of closings in the quarter were comprised 40% first time, 36% move-up, and 24% active adult, which is in alignment with our stated goal for the buyer mix for our business. In the fourth quarter of 2022, closings were 36% first time, 39% move-up, and 25% active adult. Our average community count for the fourth quarter was 919, which represents an 8% increase over last year's fourth quarter average of 850 communities, and was in line with our prior guidance. Looking at order activity in the quarter, our net new orders increased 57% over last year to 6,214 homes. The large increase over last year reflects both improved demand in 2023, as well as the extremely difficult operating environment in the fourth quarter of 2022. As discussed previously, demand conditions grew increasingly difficult early in the fourth quarter this year as mortgage rates climbed to 8%, but we experienced a notable improvement in buying activity as rates decreased over the back half of the quarter. On a sequential basis, our absorption pace improved from November to December, and we would attribute much of this improvement to the decline in interest rates. Along with stronger demand conditions, the year-over-year increase in fourth quarter net new orders benefited from a decrease in cancellation rates. In the most recent quarter, cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog fell to 9%, down from 11% in the comparable prior year period. Looking at our order activity by buyer group, fourth quarter net new orders increased 70% for first time buyers, 78% for move-up buyers, and 15% for active adult buyers. Our order numbers indicate that demand improved across all buyer groups, which is a very positive dynamic when assessing potential housing demand in 2024. As a result of our sales and closing activity, our quarter end backlog was 12,146 homes, which is effectively flat with last year. Reflective of the increased mix of first-time buyers and their lower average sales prices, our ending backlog value declined slightly to $7.3 billion. Inclusive of the 7,128 homes we started in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with 16,889 homes in production. 44% of our production is spec, including 1,263 finished specs, which puts us in a strong position to meet buyer demand as we head into the spring selling season. By the end of the fourth quarter, our construction cycle time was down to 130 days, which is a sequential improvement of about two weeks from the end of the third quarter. Going forward, we continue to target getting our cycle time down to 100 days or below by the end of the year. Based on our production pipeline, we expect closings in the first quarter of 2024 to be between 6,200 and 6,600 homes. And given our units under production, we expect full-year deliveries to grow by 5% to 30,000 homes. We currently expect the average sales price of closings to remain in the range of $540 million to $550,000 for the first quarter and the full year of 2024, which is consistent with our fourth quarter pricing. At the midpoint, this would imply price stability over the course of the year. Our fourth quarter gross margin was 28.9%, which is down approximately 50 basis points from both the fourth quarter of last year and the third quarter of this year, but likely remains the industry leader among the big builders. As with the entire year, our fourth quarter margins reflect higher incentive and input costs. Incentives, which primarily impact revenues, increased 50 basis points sequentially from the third quarter to 6.5%. On the cost side, lower lumber prices offset inflation and other material and labor, but higher land and land development costs impacted margins in the period. Given my prior comments that we expect pricing to be flat in 2024, we anticipate that land and house cost inflation will result in gross margins to be in the range of 28% to 28.5% for each quarter during the year.  We reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $308 billion, or 7.4% of home sale revenues, compared with prior year SG&A expense of $351 million, or 7.1%. The 30-basis point drop in overhead leverage can be attributed to the lower closings and revenues realized in the quarter versus the prior year. It should be noted that we recorded $65 billion of pre-tax insurance benefit in the fourth quarters of both 2023 and 2022. Based on anticipated closing volumes, we expect SG&A expense for the full year of 2024 to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Given our typical seasonality of closings, we expect SG&A expense in the first quarter to be approximately 10% of home sale revenues, with overhead leverage improving as we move through the remaining quarters of the year.  For the fourth quarter, our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $44 million, which is up from $24 million last year. The improvement in pre-tax income reflects more favorable market conditions across our financial services platform, coupled with higher capture rates, including an increase to 85%, up from 75% last year in our mortgage operations. Our reported pre-tax income for the most recent quarter was $947, million compared with prior year pre-tax income of $1.2 billion. In the period, we recorded tax expense of $236 million for an effective tax rate of 24.9%. Projecting ahead to 2024, we expect our full-year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. Looking at the bottom line, our reported fourth quarter results showed net income of $711 million or $3.28 per share. In the comparable prior year period, we reported net income of $882 million, or $3.85 per share. For the full year of 2023, we reported net income of $2.6 billion and a record earnings of $11.72 per share. Reflective of our strong operating results, in 2023 we generated cash flows from operations of $2.2 billion. Given our current expectations for operating and financial results, along with our plans to increase land investment to $5 billion in the coming year, we expect 2024 cash flows from operations to be approximately $1.8 billion.  Turning to our investment and capital allocation activities, we invested $1.3 billion in land acquisition and development in the fourth quarter, of which 59% was for development of our existing land assets. For the year, our land investment totaled $4.3 billion, of which 59% was for development. Given our constructive views on near and longer term housing dynamics, as noted, our plan is to increase our land spend to approximately $5 billion in 2024. We would again anticipate a roughly 60/40 split between development and land acquisition. This increase in investment is consistent with Ryan's earlier comments regarding positioning the business to routinely grow future delivery volumes by 5% to 10% per year. Inclusive of our fourth quarter investments, we ended 2023 with 223,000 lots under control, which is an increase of 5% over the prior year. I would highlight that on a year-over-year basis, we lowered our owned lot count by 4,000 lots, while increasing our lots under option by roughly 16,000 lots. As a result, our percentage of lots under option increased to 53%, up from 48% last year. There's still a lot of runway ahead of us to achieve our goal of 70% option lots, but we're moving in the right direction.  Based on the investments we've made and our anticipated community openings and closings in 2024, we expect our average community count in 2024 to be up 3% to 5% in each quarter as compared to the comparable prior year period. Consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we continue to return capital to shareholders in 2023. To that end, we paid out $142 million in dividends, and have increased our dividend per share by 25%, starting in the first quarter of 2024. We also repurchased 13.8 billion common shares at a cost of $1 billion for an average price of $72.50 per share, which included $300 million of repurchases at an average price of $83.03 per share in the fourth quarter. With the 13.8 billion shares acquired in 2023, we have repurchased approximately half of the shares outstanding at the time we initiated the program back in 2013. Having repurchased these shares at an average cost of $32.16 per share, we believe it's been a great investment for our shareholders. In addition to buying our stock, in the fourth quarter we took advantage of market conditions by using $35 billion of cash on hand to pay down a portion of our debt. For all of 2023, we retired $101 million of our 2026 and 2027 senior notes through open market transactions, helping to lower our quarter end debt to capital ratio to 15.9%, down 280 basis points from last year. Adjusting for the $1.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, we ended the year with a net debt to capital ratio of 1.1%.  Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. Successfully navigating our business through the past 12 months of rising interest rates has been challenging. The same could be said about the past 24, 36, and 48-month periods as we battled through COVID and the global collapse in supply chains. I am extremely proud of how our entire team responded to these events and the exceptional operating and financial results PulteGroup has delivered over an unprecedented period. Looking back over the five-year period of 2019 to the just recently completed 2023, we grew volumes 5% annually and delivered just under 135,000 homes. To support our growth during this period and for future years, we invested almost $19 billion in cumulative land acquisition and development spend. Through our disciplined land investment, operational focus, and organizational expertise, we capitalized on market conditions to grow earnings per share over this period at a compounded annual growth rate of 34%, while delivering an average annual return on equity of just over 26%. It's this type of strong financial performance during an extended period of market volatility that has prompted increased discussion about the need to reconsider how the large homebuilders are valued. I think that if you want to be valued differently, you must demonstrate a fundamental change in how you operate the business and the results you deliver, not just for a year or two, but over an extended period of time. What's different about the past five years is that while investing $19 billion into our operation, we also generated almost $7 billion in net cash flow from operations during the sustained period of growth. In fact, we recorded only one year of negative cash flow from operations since shifting our focus in 2012 from just topline growth, to driving high returns over the housing cycle. We paid off $1.1 billion of debt, while cutting our leverage by more than half, to end 2023 with a debt to capital ratio of 15.9%, and a net debt to capital ratio of 1.1%. And we returned $4 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. I'd add that the reality is, we've been operating our business in just this way for really the past 10 years. I know stocks reflect performance, so I believe that if we can continue to both grow our business and deliver ROE that remains among the industry leaders, while generating positive cash flow and maintaining a low risk profile, that our stock price and shareholders will ultimately be rewarded.  Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim Zeumer : Great. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So, Mandeep, if you would explain the process, we'll get started. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please go ahead. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Morning, guys. Hope you're doing well. Ryan, I wanted to ask a little bit more about January. Could you maybe expand on how business has been, and what I'm really interested in is, have you seen enough traffic or sales rates to start to think about more broadly pulling incentives down or even starting to raise base across the footprint? Ryan Marshall : Carl, so Bob highlighted in the prepared remarks that we - specifically in Q4, October, November, were really below expectations, and it was driven by high rates. We had a great December, highest month in the quarter in terms of absolute sales and absorptions per community. So, that was certainly an anomaly for typical December seasonal patterns. And the strength has really continued into January, Carl. So, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about how the year is starting. In terms of kind of where it sets us up for reduced discounts, increased prices, we're going to watch it closely, and I think we've demonstrated through past behavior that we're always looking to find the sweet spot between pace and price. It won't come as a surprise to you, Carl, that affordability with the buyers remains a challenge. And so, I think we're going to have to be thoughtful about what we do on both the incentive and the price increase front, but we're feeling pretty good about how the year started. Carl Reichardt : All right. Thanks for that, Ryan. And then I'm going to ask a couple of questions just on move-up. Obviously, the entry level business has been strong for volumes. Move-up, a number of your peers have kind of shifted some of their investments more towards the low end. That's been going on for quite some time. Can you talk a little bit about how that - how you look at that business this year? Is there any alteration in mix in terms of communities and whether or not maybe your CAN rate in that business is improving faster than the other businesses? We're trying to see if the existing housing market's unlocking enough that you can start to see even more strength in that particular segment. Thanks. Ryan Marshall : Yes. Carl, our move-up business performed incredibly well in the quarter. We had, on a year-over-year basis, the growth was north of 70%. So, I think that segment performed very well. The margins out of our move-up, as well as our Del Webb business continue to be some of our best gross margins. So, we're seeing real financial strength there also. And then in terms of kind of community mix, Carl, we're kind of right in line with where our long-term strategic targets are in terms of kind of that part of our business being about 35% of our overall mix. So, we feel pretty good about where that business is positioned. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, just maybe another point of clarification that not only were the sales strong, it was our strongest absorptions on a same-store basis. So, that consumer actually has performed well, to Ryan's point, strong margins and absorptions. Carl Reichardt : Thank you, Bob. Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Bouley : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the details and for taking the questions. Question on the high-level growth algorithm that you gave, Ryan, around the kind of 5% to 10% growth annually. Talking the low end of that this year because you walked away from some deals in 2022. So, my question is, is this kind of sort of a one-year hold, so to speak, and do you have the lands that you need today to kind of get back to your algorithm by 2025? Or how should we think about getting to that level of growth going forward? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. We feel really good about how we position the land pipeline. We've been investing for growth for a number of years, and we've been trying to do it in a very responsible way specific to having less owned and more optioned land. The fact that over the last 15 months we've made significant headway with our land banking platform, has helped with that. So, we really like the number of lots that we have under control at 225,000 plus or minus. And we like the ownership structure, or the way that we or the way that we've controlled those lands. We think it's a really capital-efficient structure. Specific to your growth target number, yes, we\u2019re going to be at the lower end for 2024. Beyond that, we feel that we've got the right structure to kind of be in that range for future periods. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, maybe I'd add to that, the land for 2025 is under contract and probably in development right now. And so, we have line of sight to 2024, 2025, even up to 2026. We're still working through some of that, but we've - you can see from the approvals that we've did in this most recent quarter or for the year, 40,000 lots, no issues from our perspective in terms of lining up that type of growth rate. Matthew Bouley : Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. Thanks, guys. Second one, back to the gross margin question, I think you're guiding 2024 margins to be down at roughly 70 basis points from where you exited the fourth quarter. I think I heard you say, Bob, that it's kind of flat pricing and then you've got some headwinds in land, labor, and materials. I'm just curious if you kind of unpack that a little bit and maybe specifically focus on the land side, how are you kind of thinking about those headwinds to the margin, and how does that kind of play into that guide in 2024? Thank you. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, fair question, and I think we laid it out this way. To try and answer that question, I'll give you a little more color. We see pricing flat during the year. Now, you might see different pricing at different consumer groups. The first time is the most affordability challenge, and that's where we saw actually the biggest decline in the current quarter. But we think pricing is relatively flat through 2024. We see modest, call it, 2% to 4% house construction cost increases kind of mid to upper single-digit land increases, which is what we've experienced this year. And so, when you kind of mix that all together - the one other point I guess I'd offer to clarify is, we're assuming incentive loads stay about the same at the 6.5% that we saw in this quarter. So, when you marry that all up together, a little bit of a decline year-over-year, but still 28% to 28.5%, pretty strong margin performance. Matthew Bouley : Perfect. All right, thanks, Bob. Thanks, Ryan. Good luck, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line at John Lovallo with UBS. Please go ahead. John Lovallo : Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions. The first one, just maybe talking about January again, curious how orders looked versus normal seasonality, if you will. And I think first quarter absorptions typically rise, call it, 40% to 45% sequentially. Is there anything that would preclude that from happening in your opinion outside of rates maybe in the first quarter of this year? Ryan Marshall : Yes, John, we didn't give a specific increase out of December. We kept more of our commentary around the qualitative side of things, which I'd reiterate, we're very pleased with how things are performing in January, and we'd expect that strength to continue. So, we continue to be in a situation where there's low supply. Affordability has definitely gotten better. You heard Bob's comment about kind of what we've assumed with our incentive load. So, yes, I'd expect us to have a strong Q1. The one thing - other thing I'd offer that's probably of note is we're starting to see some real signs of life in our western markets. Those have been - that's been a part of the country that was slow for the majority of kind of 2022 and most all of 2023. But in the last 30 to 45 days, we\u2019re really starting to see those markets pick up, which is a welcomed outcome. John Lovallo : Makes sense. And then on the share buyback, that was encouraging to see, and I think could be a good driver of returns as we move forward here, over the past few years, I think you guys have done about $1 billion per year. The authorization now is closer to $1.8 billion. How are you thinking about 2024 buybacks relative to the past few years? I mean, should we expect north of a billion? Ryan Marshall : Honestly, I'm going to defer. We typically do - we report the news on that. I think you highlight, we've done about $1 billion a year the last couple of years. We have $.8 billion in cash. We have offered that we project about $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations in the current year. So, our capital allocation priorities don't change. We've said we're going to increase our land investment to $5 billion. That's up about 16% year-over-year. We increased our dividend 25%. That's not a huge cash element, but still, I think reflective of our confidence in the business. We do have $.8 billion of authorization. And like I said, we'll report the news. You saw this year we bought back $100 million of our notes because it was attractive. The rate environment has made that a little less attractive, but we always look at liability management as part of the equation. So, really no change to our capital allocation priorities. John Lovallo : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Stephen Kim : Yes, thanks very much, guys. First question relates to your land on the balance sheet. I think that your cashflow guide seems to suggest, at least for my modeling, a modest rise in your own lot count, while you keep a year supply of owned lots fairly stable. I was wondering if that's right, and if there's any opportunity or desire to actually reduce your land holdings in years further. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, so a couple things there. We are increasing our land spend in 2024 from $4.3 billion to $5 billion. Our mix of developed spend versus land acquisition spend will continue to probably be about 60% development, 40% land acq. And then our long-term desire is to have 70% of our land control via option. We highlighted in the prepared remarks, this year we moved that from 48% option to 53% controlled via option. So, we're - I think both in - we demonstrated through results over the past number of years as well as kind of articulated long-term goals, we want to be land lighter. We're going to continue to do it the right way, all with an eye toward delivering a lower risk model that's very capital-efficient as well. Stephen Kim : Well, I guess, Ryan, I mean, you gave most of that information in your opening remarks, so I appreciate that. But I guess the gist of my question, trying to incrementally understand what your plans are a little bit more is to try to understand the actual amount of owned lots. Are you looking to get to your 70% option versus owned mix by keeping your owned lot count kind of flat, or your supply flat with where you are, or are you actually looking to reduce that in addition to increasing your option lot exposure to kind of get to that 70% eventually? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Stephen, in terms of years owned, we'd expect to probably keep that right around the level that we're at, maybe a slight decrease. And then ultimately, we would start to flip from a years owned to years option. You'll see a little bit of a trade in that mix. Stephen Kim : Okay, that helps. And then when you talked about land banking and continuing to increase that, could you describe for us the - when you think generally about what you're seeing in the market in terms of pricing, in terms of the way these negotiations are going with your land bankers, what kind of anticipated haircut to gross margin do you typically get when you go from just sort of buying versus doing a land option? And what's the benefit to your inventory turns that you typically think about? So, what's the tradeoff basically in your mind, some rules of thumb for us? Ryan Marshall : Yes, I don't know that there's kind of a hard and fast answer to that, Stephen. It depends on the mix of the business that we've got. In terms of margin, it can be a couple of hundred basis points on a relative basis. And in terms of inventory turns, certainly it's going to be more efficient than a bulk raw transaction. But it depends on the life of the asset. So, it in Del Webb, it's going to be very different than it is in the Centex business for us. So, I wouldn't want to paint that with too broad a brush. Stephen Kim : Okay, that's fine. I appreciate it. That's fine. I appreciate it. Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Joe Ahlersmeyer : Yes, thanks very much. Good morning, everybody. Just a question on the assumption on the incentive load in the gross margin guidance. I'm wondering if that represents more just a state of conservatism right now, waiting to see what happens with rates further, or if it's more about your philosophy as rates fall that you might allow that to flow through to affordability and drive volume versus letting it be a big margin benefit. If you could just talk about that tradeoff. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Joe, we've - I think the reason we've assumed that the incentive load stays about where it is just because affordability continues to be challenged. So, we've got low supply but interest rates are relatively higher. And because of low supply, I think there's still some pressure on prices being elevated historically. So, we talked a lot in 2023 about how successful we were in helping to solve some of the affordability challenges with the incentive dollars that we put toward the forward mortgage commitments. We'll continue to use that as a tool in 2024. Now, as rates fall, we think the cost of those forwards mortgage rate commitments will become less. We've made an assumption that we reallocate some of those incentive dollars to other things that help to solve the affordability challenge and get a buyer into their home. So, is it conservative? Time will tell. I think what you've seen from us historically is, we're not afraid to raise price. We're not afraid to cut discounts, and we're always looking to optimize pace and price. You've also heard me talk the last several quarters, we're not going to be margin proud. So, we\u2019re doing things to be responsive to what the market is, to derive an outcome that yields the best return for our shareholders. And you'll see us actively managing all things, pace, price, incentives, forward, more forward mortgage commitments, et cetera. Joe Ahlersmeyer : Understood. Thanks a lot for that. And I appreciate your comments about the valuation. Sounds like you think that cashflow is a bigger part of that potentially even than just percentage of option lots or any metric on the land side about the cash flow. I tend to agree. And so, just wondering if you are internally starting to think about your leverage in the context of cash flow or profits, and not so much on what it makes up relative to your inventory balance. It's kind of thinking almost more like a manufacturer or distributor, because right now you're net debt is at about 13 days of operating profits. Just thinking about the potential for using more debt going forward. Thanks. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, that's an interesting question. I'm not sure we can think like a manufacturing company completely. The risk profiles are different. But having said that, I think there are - based on the strength of the operation, based on the cash flow that we've consistently shown despite growth, which historically is not the way this industry has behaved, we believe there is an opportunity for people to think a little bit differently about the equity. In terms of how we manage the leverage on the balance sheet, a lot of that will have to do with our opportunities to invest in the business and what we do on the share repurchases. But even you look at the rating agencies, they've been slow, but they've been responsive to kind of I think seeing the value in the business model and also the way the debt gets looked at. So, would we use more debt for something? Without question, if it were for the right thing. Joe Ahlersmeyer : That's helpful, Bob. Thanks so much. Take care. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Appreciate it. wanted to circle back just on incentives and where we are today and to the extent that there's the potential for those to decline, how we should think about the impact on 2024. So, when you talk about, I think assuming in 2024, 6.5% of a load rate for incentives, and I believe you said that was similar to the fourth quarter, if you could just remind us where you were in the fourth quarter versus the third and earlier in the year. And to the extent that perhaps incentives ticked down a little bit in the first quarter of 2024, should we be thinking that that would be a 3Q or a 4Q impact? Just trying to get the sense there of the lag. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, I'll take the first part of that, and then I'll have Bob do the last piece. So, we're up 50 basis points from Q3. We were 6% in Q3, 6.5% in Q4. In terms of what that means for 2024, I think I addressed it on a prior call. We're going to actively be managing our incentive load, but we've shared with you what our assumption is in kind of current form. If there's an opportunity to peel those back, we'll do it and we'll certainly share that with you. In terms of kind of the quarters that it would impact, right now about 50% - somewhere around 50% of our sales are spec. so, those are closing in kind of the following quarter. Spec sales now would either be late Q1 closings or early Q2 closings. If it's a dirt sale, Q1 closings typically end up being Q3 or early Q4 closing. So, we factored all of those assumptions into the margin guide that we gave for the year, which is 28% to 28.5%, just to repeat that. And then Bob, I don't know if you have the incentive load for Q1, Q2. I think that was the only piece I didn't answer. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. It was about 6% in each of the first, second, and third quarters, and it was 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. Michael Rehaut : Great. No, that's helpful. Thank you for that. I guess secondly, I'd love to kind of shift a little bit to the SG&A side. I think you gave guidance for the first quarter, but you've been running last couple of years plus or minus around 9%, low 9%. Obviously, we've heard a little bit about higher commission rates coming back maybe in a more choppy market at points in the past year or so. Overall solid market, but still we've heard a little bit about commissions maybe coming up a little bit. How should we think about SG&A and the potential for further leverage over the next couple of years against the growth algorithm that you talked about? And if commissions, let's say are stable from here, could we see an 8% at some point or getting closer to an 8% number? Would just love your thoughts on that. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, we've - I think we've always been thoughtful in how we spend SG&A dollars. We have historically made some extra investments in the quality of the homes that we build and deliver and the customer experience that we provide for our homeowners. And then we - and we invest incremental dollars in the culture of our workforce. So, we\u2019ve tried to maintain balance within the SG&A structure as well. We're not trying to run kind of the leanest and the lean - on the lean end, we're also not trying to overspend. I think we're trying to be very balanced. In terms of the leverage for 2024 specifically, we've kind of given the guide, which will put us kind of in the low nines. And that's really reflective of kind of what Bob guided too on the average sales price, which we're expecting to be flat. And against that, you've still got wage inflation for kind of our internal employees running close to 3.5%, 4%. So, there's some pressure. There's pressure on the SG&A front that we're not necessarily getting the benefit of on the ASP increase side. So, in terms of kind of where it goes into the future, time will tell, but we\u2019ve given the best visibility that we can for 2024. Bob, I don\u2019t know if you - anything you'd add on SG&A. Bob keeps us honest, I'll tell you that. We're not overspending anywhere, at least not under Bob's watch. Michael Rehaut : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sam Reid with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Sam Reid : Hey, thanks so much, guys, for taking my question here. Wanted to drill down a little bit on the first-time buyer. You guys have given a lot of good color on pricing. It does sound like price did move lower for this buyer group a bit again during the quarter. Maybe help us unpack the relative split perhaps between higher incentives for this buyer group as you try to make these homes more affordable versus perhaps some of the other affordability levers that you might be pulling, like smaller floor plans, et cetera. Kind of any color here would be appreciated. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, I would tell you, if you look year-over-year, pricing at 422 to that buyer is down 6%. Year-over-year is down about 1% versus the trailing quarter, so the third quarter of this year. And I would tell you it is largely incentive-related. And so, we're not - we haven't in the last three months or the last 12 months, had a radical redesign of the product that we're offering to people. Communities, when they get entitled, you have product approvals. So, to a degree, you can see people saying, I want the smaller floor plan. I would tell you, that's not the driver of the price change. It is the incentive load that we've introduced. So, it's that 220 basis points, which for that buyer is about, call it, $8,000. That's the price decline. Sam Reid : No, that's helpful. And maybe one more on pricing here, just from a slightly different vantage point. You guys have given good color in the past on option and lot premiums and the impact on ASP. I want to say it's been around $100,000 or north of $100,000 across your entire mix throughout 2023. Curious as to where that trended in Q4, and maybe give us a sense as to your outlook for that piece of the price component into 2024. Ryan Marshall : Yes, in the fourth quarter, it was $105,000 per unit, so it's down about $4,000 versus the prior year. And so, I think that speaks to the sales team, and I give them a lot of credit. Where we've needed incentive has been less around options and lot premiums and more oriented towards financing. So, we didn't see a big change there, which I think is a real positive. It also is - interestingly, for that move-up in active adult buying, we've highlighted the relative strength from them in this quarter and the relative pricing strength there. So, just like our first time was down about 6%, our move-up pricing was actually flat quarter-over-quarter, and our active adult was actually tough 3%. And I think it's reflective of the way we go to market, the way we sell the lots that we've got, the options that people put in houses. So, our teams are still doing a really good job of providing value for that which people desire. Sam Reid : Helpful color all around. I'll pass it on, guys. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Ken Zener with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. Ken Zener : Morning, everybody. I've got two very simple questions. First is on land banking. What percent of closings do you expect to be from finished lots once you reach your 70% option owned scenario generally? Ryan Marshall : It's an interesting question. Certainly, the land banking would be finished lots. But for the optionality that we have with individual sellers, many of those were self-developing. And so, I don't - I don\u2019t know, Jim, if you \u2026 Jim Ossowski : Yes. My - and this is a, a little bit of a guess, Ken, roughly 20% to 25% of our total closings, once we get to 70/30, will be finished lots. The rest will - there'll be a lot of optionality in there. But to Bob's point, a lot of our options we take down as raw land chunks, and then we self-develop those. They\u2019re still highly efficient. It's just a different form of an option structure. Ken Zener : Right. I assume that's kind of reflecting your entry level exposure as well. Second question is, talk to options. Again, could you update us what percent of your ASP is coming from options? And then comment on the margin benefit you get from that, if you could, so we could discern your operating construction, operating construction costs versus your strategy of bringing in these options. Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Sorry, I want to make sure I understand the \u2026 Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: The $4,000, the $105,000 you just gave. Ryan Marshall : How much of it is options? Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: No, I think \u2026 Ken Zener : Right. Your total ASP, you have a certain option exposure more at move-up and adult - active adult, but could you talk to the margin impact of that as well? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes. So, of the $105,000 of option and lot premium, $80,000 is options, $25,000, that's lots premium. I could say for instance, lot premiums are pure margin. I'm not sure that that's fair, right? Pricing doesn't really work that way. But in terms of the option spend, typically it's going to have a relatively rich margin mix, call it, 50%. And so, it is accretive to the overall margin. And the way we try and go to market, Ken, and I don\u2019t know if this answers it better, we put a base price house that we think is kind of market standard and what people can and should expect to pay for that house. Then we start talking about, okay, which lot do you want? What are you willing to pay for that lot? That's what generates the $25,000. And then, okay, now in the house, if we're offering optionality - and we don't for everyone, right? So, for the Centex buyer, we may have curated packages or no choices at all. But for the folks that can do structural options for fit and finish, that's what's driving that $80,000 in incremental revenue. Ken Zener : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for all the details so far. A question on cycle times. So, congrats on the improvement there. Sounds like you expect to see further improvement in 2024. Curious to get to the 100-day target from 130 where you're at right now, you guys are targeting 5% growth. We've heard some other builders may be a little bit higher than that. Is there a level from a labor perspective where if builders try to push starts more significantly, that you think cycle time improvement might stall a bit? Are there any constraints that you could foresee, or is the unleashing of kind of the normalization of the supply chain just kind of independent of whatever the start pace might look like in 2024? Ryan Marshall : Yes, it\u2019s a fair question. Based on the total amount of production that's happening, I don't see the industry stressing the labor availability. I'm not suggesting there's a whole bunch of excess labor running around out there, but at least for the big builders, I think we've got great trade relationships, and I think we'll continue to get, not only schedule performance, but the labor on our job sites. I think the pressure likely comes on dollars before - or more so than time. If we're running into labor pinches because of a volume increase, I think it's probably dollars more than time. A lot of the decreases that we'll take, it'll be because we're getting things on a predictable schedule like we used to pre-COVID. So, that's working better, which allows us to take some kind of dead days out of our schedule that we had - we built in for things to go wrong or for time when we were just literally waiting for material to show up. So, it\u2019s a little bit of that, a little bit of, we're just getting back to the cycle times that we had pre-COVID. So, we trimmed out about 30 or so days in 2024, or in 2023, rather. We think we can get another 30 or so days by the end of 2024, and we'll be back largely in line with pre-COVID cycle times. Alan Ratner : Great. Appreciate those added thoughts, Ryan. And then I guess in a similar vein, was curious if you could just give an update on the ICG growth plans there and kind of how that's been trending and what your current thinking is as far as additional market expansion, if there is any. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan, it continues to go well. We have two plants today. Both are focused in the southeast part of the US. Our growth plans are still largely on target. Still largely on target to have approximately eight factories. So, we haven't announced anything new. Similar to our share buybacks, we'll probably report the news on that as opposed to give forward-looking forecast. Alan Ratner : And I guess if I could sneak one in on that, I mean it's hard for us to conceptualize what impact that has on your business, and obviously it's concentrated in a handful of markets right now, but are there certain kind of metrics that you can share with us, whether it's cycle times or costs, margin, et cetera, that you can kind of demonstrate on a case study basis, how that's contributing to your business right now? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan, so that's - we haven't given a bunch of guidance on that just because it is concentrated into a couple of markets, and we don't feel it's appropriate to extrapolate the entire enterprise yet. As we get further down the path, we'll share more. Conceptually, it's exactly what you highlighted. We're getting cycle time improvements. We're getting better quality, and there are some raw material cost savings that we believe we're getting as well. Alan Ratner : I appreciate that. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for fitting me in. My first question is just around the specs. You mentioned that you had about 44%, I think of your production that's in spec. As you think about the year and the way that the demand may come together, any thoughts on where that may move, or how you're thinking about it longer term? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Susan, I wouldn't anticipate a massive change from the percentage. We're probably on the higher end of the range that we'll have in spec right now. Specific to the fourth quarter, we put more spec starts in the ground than what we sold, and that was intentional. We wanted to have some additional inventory going into the spring selling season, which we have. So, as we move throughout the year, probably right in line with where we're at or a tad lower. Susan Maklari : Okay, that's helpful. And then when we think generally about the potential for rates to come down this year, and that possibly driving some increase on the existing home side of the market, any thoughts on what the implications of that could be, especially perhaps on the move-up and the active adult parts of the businesses, and any initiatives you have relative to that? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Susan, with the rate cuts that are forecasted, I don't see it being at a level that's going to unleash a tidal wave of resale inventory. So, is it better than where we're at today? Certainly. Will that start to free up some resale inventory? I think so. And I think that's probably helpful against the backdrop of, we continue to be under-supplied in the country. So, on balance, I don't think it has much impact at all on what we're projecting for our business in 2024. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thanks for the color and good luck. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America, where we've reached the time allotment for this morning's call. Please go ahead. Rafe Jadrosich : Great. Thank you, and thanks for taking my questions. Can you - in terms of the additional 30 days of build cycle improvement you're expecting for 2024, can you talk about what the build cycles are in homes that you're starting today? Like, are you already at that 100-day level, and is that improvement embedded in your cashflow guide? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Rafe, it's a fair question. The homes that we're starting today will deliver in kind of late - so homes we\u2019re starting today will deliver in Q2 basically. So, no, we're not at the 100 days yet. Now, that being said, there are some markets and some communities where we\u2019re at the 100 days, and in fact, we were at the 100 days last year. When you blend it all together, we think it'll be Q4 before we're at the 100 days that we've highlighted as our goal. Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy: And Rafe, our guide does factor in what we see in terms of cycle times during the year, the cash flow guide, to your question. Rafe Jadrosich : Got. Thank you. That's helpful. And then you gave really helpful color in terms of the land inflation you're expecting in your gross margin for 2024, and you have the land you have the land that you need through 2025. On the land that you are contracting today, what are you seeing in terms of inflation? Is it at a similar level or are you actually seeing that come down? And then can you kind of help us understand the difference between development cost inflation relative to what you're seeing for raw land? Ryan Marshall : Yes, so - sorry, I forgot the first part of the question. Rafe Jadrosich : You spoke about the land inflation in the \u2026 Ryan Marshall : Oh, I think I got it. I'm sorry. Yes, we - listen, it's interesting. Land prices don't come down very often. They're sticky. And we've seen, and we've highlighted sort of sequential increases in lot costs. I would tell you that the land we're seeing today is consistent with that. Prices are pretty robust and it's a pretty competitive landscape out there. We underwrite to return. And so, it's - we look to see, can we get return out of that. So, I think no change honestly in the land market. In terms of the inflationary aspect, what we are seeing is that that labor constraint influences the development of land, just like it does building of houses. And with general cost inflation that we were seeing last year in particular, it was influencing the spends of type. Everything that we do to do the development of the communities was running pretty hot too. So, again, we've highlighted, we think it's going to be a little bit more expensive in terms of our lot increase this year for 2024. And again, I think that just reflects all the activity that was going on and some of the cost inflation that we saw in 2023 feeding into our lots this year in 2024. The good news is, the vertical, we're seeing a pretty benign in that market, whereas that had been running pretty hot last year obviously. So, the slowdown in inflation, we feel it now in the house. Hopefully, we'll feel that a little bit later and land. It would be an opportunity for us, for sure. Rafe Jadrosich : Great. Thank you. Appreciate all the color. Operator : I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Zeumer for closing remarks. Jim Zeumer : Appreciate everybody's time this morning. We'll certainly be available over the rest of the day if you have any additional questions. Otherwise, we'll look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call.

Q1 2024 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star, one again. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. You may begin. James Zeumer : Great, thanks Jeannie. Good morning. Let me welcome everyone to today\u2019s call. We look forward to discussing PulteGroup\u2019s outstanding Q1 operating and financial results for the period ended March 31, 2024. I\u2019m joined on the call today by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior VP, Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning\u2019s presentation slides has been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We\u2019ll post an audio replay of this call later today. We want to alert everyone that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks Jim, and good morning. As you read in this morning\u2019s press release, PulteGroup reported record first quarter results across many of our key financial metrics. From top line revenues of $3.8 billion and gross margins of 29.6% to bottom line earnings of $3.10 per share, it was an exceptional quarter. These strong first quarter results helped to drive a return on equity of 27.3% for the trailing 12-month period. Our strong first quarter results reflect long-term strategic planning and a disciplined capital allocation process that have underpinned PulteGroup\u2019s success for more than a decade. I would suggest that another driver of our record Q1 results are decisions we made in the fourth quarter of last year, decisions that I think are emblematic of the balanced approach we take to running our business and to delivering high returns. On our last earnings call, we talked about decisions we made in the fourth quarter of last year to not lower our prices in a chase for volume. As you will recall, demand in the fourth quarter of 2023 had started slowly but improved as interest rates began to moderate. As we made the decision to push incentives aggressively as the quarter progressed, we likely could have delivered higher closing volumes in \u201923. With demand improving in the fourth quarter, we elected to hold our pricing and have had more inventory available for the 2024 spring selling season. The result of this decision is that we were in a position to sell and close more homes in the first quarter of 2024, and at higher margins. That\u2019s what you see in our Q1 results - closings and gross margins above our guide as demand dynamics allowed us to sell more homes with better net pricing. When buyer demand is rising, we\u2019re often asked how many more homes we can sell given the value we place on entitled loss and our focus on driving high returns. More volume is not the only answer as we work to balance pace and price to drive high returns. Within our operating model, stronger demand provides choices : we can sell more houses or we can raise prices, or as was the case in the first quarter, we can do both. What we experienced in the first quarter is that areas of strong demand last year, such as the southeast, Florida and Texas, continued to perform well into 2024. Even more positive is that areas that had some struggles in 2023, notably Arizona, California and Nevada, were much improved in 2024. Consistent with the favorable conditions in the first quarter, almost all our markets displayed pricing dynamics that were stable or improving, which allowed us to raise net pricing in more than half of our communities. As you\u2019ve heard us say many times, our pricing decisions are made with a goal of delivering high returns and the best overall business outcomes. Depending upon the community and the buyer\u2019s wants and needs, we may have raised base prices or lowered incentives, the result being that net pricing in the quarter across many of our markets was up between 1% and 5%. The impact of these actions on our business performance is powerful. As Bob will discuss, we are increasing guidance for both full-year closings and gross margins. Against generally favorable demand conditions, the supply of available housing remains tight. We have a long-term structural issue resulting from a decade of under-building that has the country short approximately 4 million housing units. At the same time, the available inventory of existing homes for sale continues to be low as homeowners remain locked into their low mortgage rates. Life happens, so we are seeing some additional existing homes come to market, but the numbers remain well below historic rates. As a homebuilder, this is a great operating environment as we are supplying a product that a lot of people need and want. I appreciate, however, that our country\u2019s housing shortage can create hardships for today\u2019s consumers as the lack of supply keeps housing prices high. In fact, some of our recent buyers said that they made the decision to buy now because they couldn\u2019t wait any longer for rates to roll back. In a market where home prices are high and because of limited inventory, they will likely continue moving higher. Our company\u2019s ability to offer targeted incentives, particularly mortgage rate buy-downs, is a powerful tool that can help bridge the affordability gap. For example, in the first quarter, approximately 25% of our home buyers used our national rate program. In a world where the consensus is that interest rates will be higher for longer, our interest rate incentives likely become an even greater competitive advantage, especially relative to the existing home seller. Higher interest rates create additional challenges for today\u2019s home buyers, but we appreciate that rates are moving higher because of a resilient economy and a strong job market. Given these conditions, we are optimistic about 2024 and PulteGroup\u2019s ability to continue delivering strong financial results. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our first quarter results. Bob? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks Ryan, and good morning. As Ryan noted, the company delivered exceptional operating and financial results in the quarter, which have us well positioned to realize outstanding financial performance throughout 2024. In the first quarter, we reported home sale revenues of $3.8 billion, which represents an increase of 10% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Higher revenues in the period were driven by an 11% increase in closings to 7,095 homes, partially offset by a 1% decrease in average sales price of $538,000. The lower closing price compared to the first quarter of last year reflects a shift in the geographic mix of homes closed as we realized relatively higher closings from our southeast and Florida markets with more modest increases in our higher priced western markets. Closings in the quarter came in above our guide as we had available spec inventory to meet the strong buyer demand we experienced this period. As Ryan highlighted, by choosing not to chase volume in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we had additional inventory in Q1 that we were able to sell and close with better margins due to the improving buyer demand activity in the quarter. Our spec production is predominantly within our first-time buyer communities, so on a year-over-year basis we realized increased closings from first-time buyers. In the quarter, our closing mix included 41% first-time, 36% move-up, and 23% active adult. In the first quarter of last year, the mix of closings consisted of 38% first-time, 36% move-up, and 26% active adult. Reflecting the favorable demand conditions we experienced in the first quarter, net new orders increased 14% over last year to 8,379 homes. In the quarter, we realized a year-over-year increase in gross orders and a reduction in cancellation rates. Cancellations as a percentage of starting backlog fell to 10.1%, down from 12.7% in the first quarter last year. Average community count for our first quarter was 931, which is an increase of 6% over the prior year and in line with our guidance for year-over-year community count growth of 3% to 5%. The resulting absorption pace of approximately three homes per month for the quarter was above our historic average for the period, excluding the pandemic-impacted years of \u201921 and \u201922. I would also like to highlight that orders in the quarter were higher across all buyer groups, which is another sign of the overall strength of the market. More specifically, net new orders among first-time buyers increased 8%, move-up increased 22%, and active adult increased 12%. Consistent with earlier comments, the large increase in orders among move-up buyers was influenced by improving market conditions in the west, where our business mix is much more heavily weighted towards move-up. Given this strong start to our spring selling season, our quarter-end backlog increased to 13,430 homes with a value of $8.2 billion. We started approximately 7,500 homes in the quarter and ended the period with a total of 17,250 homes under construction. Our production pipeline includes approximately 7,000 or 41% spec homes, of which 1,337 are completed. We are operating just above our target of one finished spec per community but believe carrying a few more finished specs was the right strategy, given buyers\u2019 preferences and the fact that we are still in the more active spring selling season. Given the units we have under construction and their stage of production, we expect to close between 7,800 and 8,200 homes in the second quarter. With the strong start to the year in both orders and closings, we are raising our guide for full-year closings to approximately 31,000 homes. This would represent an 8% increase over 2023, which is the higher end of our long-term goal of growing our closing volume between 5% and 10% annually. Closings in the first quarter had an average sales price of $538,000, which was slightly below our guide for pricing of $540,000 to $550,000. Relative to our guide, pricing in the quarter was influenced by the geographic mix of closings along with a higher volume of spec homes closed in the period. As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect the mix of homes closed in each quarter will result in ASPs consistent with our prior guide of $540,000 to $550,000. For the first quarter, we reported a gross margin of 29.6%, which is an increase of 50 basis points over the first quarter of \u201923 and a sequential gain of 70 basis points from the fourth quarter of \u201923. At 29.6%, our first quarter gross margin was also notably higher than our guide. Beyond Ryan\u2019s comments that we are achieving higher returns by actively managing both pace and price, mix had an impacted on our reported Q1 margins. Higher demand increased as the quarter advanced, which allowed us to sell and close more homes in the period than forecast. On a relative basis, more of these closings occurred in our higher margin markets in the southeast and Florida, resulting in a meaningful increase in reported gross margins for the quarter. Based on Q1 sign-ups and the composition of our backlog, we expect the geographic mix of closings to be more balanced as we move through the remainder of the year. That being said, we\u2019re raising our gross margin guide for the remainder of \u201924. We had previously guided to quarterly gross margins of 28% to 28.5%, but we now expect gross margins in the second quarter to be approximately 29.2%. Based on current backlog, we would expect gross margins for our third and fourth quarters to be approximately 29%, but we still have homes to sell and close, so demand conditions over the coming months will impact the results we ultimately report. Beyond buyer demand and near-term pricing dynamics, the gross margin guide for the remainder of \u201924 also reflects expected changes in the geographic mix of homes we expect to close. Given recent sign-up trends, we anticipate closing more homes in our west region, which currently have a lower relative margin profile due to the fact that we adjusted pricing in these markets over the course of \u201923 to achieve appropriate sales pace. Looking at our costs, reported SG&A in the first quarter was $358 million or 9.4% of home sale revenues. As noted in our press release, our reported SG&A for the period includes a $27 million pre-tax insurance benefit. SG&A in the first quarter of \u201923 was $337 million of 9.6% of home sale revenues. Consistent with our previous guide, we continue to expect SG&A expense for the full year to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Based on normal seasonality, we expect to realize increased overhead leverage as we move through the remaining quarters of the year. Our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $41 million for the first quarter, which is an increase of almost 200% from last year\u2019s pre-tax income of $14 million. The increase in Q1 pre-tax income was driven by better market conditions across our financial services platform. Financial services also benefited from higher capture rates across all business lines, including an increase to 84%, up from 78% last year in our mortgage operations. As noted in this morning\u2019s press release, in the first quarter we completed the sale of a joint venture that resulted in a gain of $38 million. On our income statement, this gain was recorded in equity income from unconsolidated entities. Our reported first quarter pre-tax income was period record of $869 million, an increase of 24% over last year. Against that, we reported tax expense of $206 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 23.7%. Our reported Q1 tax rate was impacted by energy tax credits and stock compensation deductions recorded in the period. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. In total, our reported Q1 net income was $663 million or $3.10 per share, compared with prior year reported net income of $533 million or $2.35 per share. Earnings per share in our most recent quarter benefited from a 6% reduction in share count compared with the prior year as we continue to systematically repurchase our stock. Moving past the income statement, we invested approximately $1.1 billion in land acquisition and development in the first quarter. Consistent with our recent land activity, 60% of our land spend in the quarter was for the development of our existing land assets. Our Q1 land spend keeps us on track with our plans to invest approximately $5 billion in land acquisition and development for the full year, of which we continue to expect about 60% will be for development with the remainder for the acquisition of new land positions. We ended the quarter with approximately 220,000 lots under control, of which 51% were held via option. The purchase of several large land positions in combination with the decision not to move forward with a few option transactions during the quarter lowered our lot option percentage from the end of 2023. I would highlight, however, that 74% of the lots we had pre-approved in this most recent quarter were under option. As our first quarter numbers indicate, we continue to work toward our multi-year goal of controlling 70% of our land by buying via option. Looking at our community count, we continue to expect average community count for 2024 to increase 3% to 5% in each quarter over the comparable prior year period. Along with investing in our business, we continue to return capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million common shares at a cost of $246 million for an average price of $106.73 per share. In the quarter, we also opportunistically purchased approximately $10 million of our outstanding bonds. After allocating approximately $1.4 billion to investments and the return of funds to shareholders, we ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion of cash. Taking all of this into account, our quarter-end gross debt to capital ratio was 15.4%, while our net debt to capital ratio was only 1.7%. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan Marshall : Thanks Bob. As you would expect, given the strength of our first quarter results, buyer interest was high in the period as order paces increased beyond typical seasonality. That sales momentum continued into April, although we are now seeing some moderation of traffic into our communities due to the recent increases in interest rates, particularly within the Centex brand. While the change is relatively modest and based on a limited number of days, consumer feedback suggests that higher rates are causing some buyers to evaluate the timing of their activity due to the volatile interest rate environment. We\u2019ll continue to monitor how buyers respond to changes in the rate environment and are prepared to adjust pricing or incentives to ensure we are appropriately turning assets. During our last earnings call, we talked about the opportunity for PulteGroup to grow its business 5% to 10% annually. Given the lengthy land investment process, organic change in this industry takes time to accomplish, but we have been systematically planning and positioning to deliver against this goal for the past few years. I think that the company\u2019s efforts are reflected in the allocation of capital into growing our business. Including our Q1 spend, since 2021 our operating teams have invested approximately $14 billion in land acquisition and development, with plans to invest another $5 billion in 2024. Along with the land, we have been investing in our people and working to ensure the needed trade capacity is available to support our expanding operations. I\u2019m proud to say that we have accomplished this while adhering to the same underwriting hurdles and investment disciplines which have been the cornerstone of PulteGroup for the past decade. Such discipline has allowed PulteGroup to more consistently grow its earnings, drive substantial cash flow from operations and deliver high returns, we have accomplished this while maintaining the superior build quality and customer experience which PulteGroup home buyers have come to expect. Before opening the call to questions, I want to take a minute to recognize and celebrate our team for once again being named a Fortune 100 Best Company to Work For. What makes this recognition so important and gratifying is that it\u2019s based on feedback from all of our employees. This marks PulteGroup\u2019s fourth consecutive year on the list and is a testament to the culture of personal caring and professional development that we work to maintain. I am proud to lead such an organization that is committed to taking care of our customers and each other. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. James Zeumer : Great, thanks Ryan. We\u2019re now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Jeannie, if you would explain the process, we\u2019ll get ready to--we can start with our Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Stephen Kim : Yes, thanks very much, guys. Impressive results, and appreciate all the guidance that you provided. I guess my first question relates to your longer term targets with respect to land. Ryan, I think the last time I asked you this question, I was curious about where your long-term target is, and I think I stated it in terms of years owned. I understand that you want to have about seven years controlled with about 30% optioned over the long term - that would put you at about a little over two years of owned land. You\u2019re quite a bit above that now, and so my question is, am I thinking about that right? Is your long-term target for owned land - you know, a little over two years owned, and over what time span do you think we should expect you to migrate to that, if that is in fact your target? Ryan Marshall : Yes Stephen, thanks for the question. I think your overall target of seven years controlled is about right, and then we stated our long-term target of optionality at 70%. We do think it will be a multi-year journey in getting there, and that\u2019s really driven by the fact, Stephen, that we want to do it in a very organic, natural way that drives ideal economics for each individual transaction. We highlighted in the prepared remarks, Bob did, that in the quarter, 74% of the deals that we approved were under option. We think that type of activity over the next several years will have us arrive at our long-term target in a very natural way. When we do that, to your point, we\u2019ll be right around something just over two, two and a half years of owned land at that point. Stephen Kim : Yes, thanks for that. As you progress in that manner, it will unlock some additional cash flow in addition to your net earnings, and so I wanted to turn to cash flow next. I think you gave a guide for cash flow from operations for the full year previously at about $1.8 billion. You\u2019ve taken up--you had a great 1Q, you\u2019ve taken up your outlook for both volume and gross margin and, let\u2019s just say, operating margin for the year. Can you give us an update on where you\u2019re thinking cash flow from operations may come in for the full year in light of those changes, and maybe even more importantly, what should we expect in terms of deployment into dividends and repurchases. I noticed this quarter, for example, it was pretty much--buybacks were pretty much equal to cash flow from operations, and your leverage has pretty much stabilized in low single digits, so is it right to think that maybe whatever you generate in cash flow from operations, with a little bit of flex quarter to quarter, but in general that\u2019s about what you would deliver in terms of repayment--sorry, repurchases in dividends? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes Stephen, it\u2019s Bob. Good morning. We didn\u2019t update the guide on cash flow. It\u2019s early in the year. We\u2019re thinking about what we\u2019re investing in the business. You can see, if you look at the balance sheet just since the end of the year, we\u2019re up about $300 million in investment in the balance sheet, roughly half land, half house, and so to your point, we certainly expect with incremental volume and incremental margin that we\u2019ll generate a pretty healthy amount of cash. Some of that will be invested to meet that 5%, 10% growth that we\u2019ve talked about, so more to come on that as the year progresses, certainly, but I think the bias will be for more cash from operations. To your point on capital allocation, I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent, right, for the last 10 years since we laid out our strategy for capital allocation : A, invest in the business, pay a dividend that grows with earnings, buy back stock with excess capital against a modest debt profile. Obviously the leverage is lower than we had anticipated. We look at liability management as part of our capital allocation, so I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d go so far as to say cash flow from operations will equal repurchase activity. I think we\u2019ve been pretty clear we\u2019re going to report the news on what our repurchases are going to be, but we obviously--in a world where we\u2019re generating cash at that level, particularly if we have less invested in the balance sheet as we move towards that 70%, it will free up capital, and we\u2019ll work through what to do with that capital as we generate it. Stephen Kim : Okay, well we\u2019ll be staying tuned. Thanks a lot, guys, and congratulations on the strong results. Ryan Marshall : Thanks Stephen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Bouley : Morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. In the fourth quarter, as you mentioned, you didn\u2019t raise incentives to chase volume. Now speaking to rates being higher for longer, eventually we\u2019ll be past the peak of the spring demand and all that, so I guess going forward, how are you thinking about that trade-off with incentives from here, given where your margins are? Is there an opportunity to perhaps trade a little bit of that margin to drive better growth, obviously in the context of supporting returns? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Matt, good morning, it\u2019s Ryan. Thanks for the question. We\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019re not going to be margin proud, and I would tell you that remains true. As we highlighted in some of my prepared remarks today, we believe our operating platform and how we\u2019ve positioned our specific community investments, we\u2019re in a great position to command excellent pricing, get pace and price, which you saw in this most recent quarter. Given the interest rate environment that we are clearly going into, higher for longer, we\u2019ve got the ability to use the very powerful tool of forward mortgage rate commitments that allow us to offer a pretty attractive incentive program. Right now, we\u2019re at 5.75% nationally, and about 25% of our buyers are taking advantage of it. The other thing I\u2019d highlight is that 60% of our business is move-up and active adult, which tends to not be quite as rate-sensitive as the first-time buyer. With that first-time buyer, that\u2019s where predominantly our Centex brand, predominantly first-time buyers, and we see a higher percentage of those buyers take advantage of the forward rate commitments. The last piece, Matthew, that I\u2019d probably point out is that our guide for the balance of the year assumes that the incentive load that we currently have, which on the most recent quarter, closings was running at 6.5%, we\u2019ve assumed that that stays flat going forward. Matthew Bouley : Got you, okay. Thank you for that, Ryan. The second one, I wanted to move to the topic of land costs and land inflation. I think last quarter, you had spoken to the potential for mid to upper single-digit inflation in land, but maybe it wasn\u2019t totally clear on exactly when that would impact your gross margin. I\u2019m curious, can you kind of walk us through the timing of land costs flowing into your gross margin, and then what are you seeing in real time in the land market? Has the market started to decelerate at all, or is it still chugging along at that mid upper single-digit rate? Thank you. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Matt, it\u2019s Bob. That mid to high single-digit increase in our lot cost was in our Q1 and is expected to continue through the balance of the year. When we gave the margin guide, we had pretty good visibility into our lot costs, because those are lots typically on the ground already, so it\u2019s there. In terms of the current market conditions, it\u2019s still competitive out there. I\u2019ve said this before - land hasn\u2019t gone on sale, and slight variations in market typically don\u2019t result in prices declining. The market is super efficient on the way up, a little bit sticky on the way down, so for quality parcels it\u2019s competitive. Matthew Bouley : Got you, all right. That\u2019s clear. Thanks Bob. Good luck, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please go ahead. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, morning guys. I think this is the first time since mid-2020 when you have addressed construction cycle times, so I thought at least I\u2019d ask. Across the markets, products and geographic markets, are cycle times effectively normalized now for you, or are we still a little bit longer than you were pre-COVID? Ryan Marshall : Good morning Carl, thanks for the question. We saw a couple of days of cycle time improvement in the most recent quarter, so we were at 128 days, down from 130 that we ended the fourth quarter of 2023 in. We are still on track and still are targeting being at 100 days by the end of the year. When we look deeper at our Q1 numbers, we had some long cycled closings that had been in production for a long time, in many cases were multi-family and condo buildings that we think kept the overall number that I just shared with you of 128 days a little bit higher than what we think is our actual run rate at this point. When we look at a lot of our markets, we\u2019re already back to pre-COVID cycle times of even sub-100 days, so we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in a lot of places. We have a few markets that are a little stickier, where we\u2019re working hard to get cycle times back to where we\u2019d like them to, but by and large we still feel that the target we\u2019ve set of 100 days is very much in reach. Carl Reichardt : Great, thank you Ryan. Then you talked a little bit about existing home inventory creep that I think we\u2019re seeing in some of the data. If we dig into that, Ryan, if you can dig into that, is this inventory that you\u2019d expect would be effectively a net neutral impact to the demand supply; in other words, [indiscernible] to move elsewhere versus vacant capacity, meaning investors or second homeowners who are putting their homes on the market effectively vacant, because I think there\u2019s an important difference between the two. To the extent that you know, what are you seeing? Thanks. Ryan Marshall : Yes, outside there might be--I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some markets, Carl, where there is vacant investor-driven inventory that you could characterize as new supply. The majority of the markets where we operate, we think any existing resale inventory that does come to market, those are buyers that are going to buy another home somewhere else, so we think it\u2019s largely neutral on the overall supply side. Carl Reichardt : Thank you Ryan. Thanks all. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about maybe the potential impact of the NAR settlement on your business, or maybe the broader industry and any kind of potential secondary impacts to Pulte. Ryan Marshall : Yes Anthony, we\u2019re watching it closely, as I think a lot of the real estate world is. Where we think it ultimately goes is it will create better transparency around the fee structure and will likely change over time the way that the providers of those services charge and the users, or the consumers, of those services ultimately pay. Realtors are an important part of our business and probably over 60% of the sales that we have include a buy-side realtor involved, so we certainly support the realtor community, they\u2019ve been an important part of our company for a long time, but we are watching the way that the landscape there will certainly change. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. Then you talked about stronger trends regionally, I think in Nevada, Arizona, California if I got that right. Is there anything particularly driving that in your view, and maybe if you can just talk about the long term attractiveness of that region as you build out the community count. Ryan Marshall : Yes, a couple things happened there. It was a market that saw a lot of price appreciation in the COVID years. Affordability, we think got strained for certain. Last year, we did a fair amount of price discovery as we worked to right-size what our go-to-market price was in those markets. That combined with, I think, a general improvement in buyer sentiment contributed to the lights coming back on in the western markets. Some of the markets that we\u2019d highlighted pretty consistently last year - Seattle, northern California, southern California, Las Vegas, Phoenix, those were strong contributors to our overall results in this most recent quarter. We\u2019d expect that to continue. Bob highlighted that the relative margin contribution out of those markets will be lower than some of the other parts of our business. We\u2019ve incorporated that incremental volume that we\u2019re getting at a slightly lower margin contribution profile into our guide. Look - we\u2019re pleased that those markets are contributing. We\u2019ve got a lot of capital invested there, they\u2019re big housing markets. People want to live there for a number of reasons - climate, jobs, etc., so we\u2019re pleased that they\u2019re doing well. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Andrew Azzi : Hey guys, good morning. This is Andrew Azzi on for Mike. A quick one. I just wanted to drill down, if I could, on the demand trends you\u2019ve been seeing over the last few months, just given the change of rates and some concerns in the market. I\u2019d love any kind of progression you saw in the quarter and here into April. Ryan Marshall : Yes, it was a strong quarter, a strong first quarter. We highlighted that we saw some trends that were even stronger than normal seasonality. The first few weeks of April have continued to show signs of strength. We did highlight that as we look at traffic, new traffic that\u2019s coming into the stores, while a limited number of days in that data set, we are seeing a small downturn that we think is reflective of the change in the rate environment. We\u2019re going to keep an eye on it. We don\u2019t at this point think it\u2019s anything to be too alarmed about, but we\u2019re watching it. Andrew Azzi : Great, thank you. Then I guess secondly on the material cost, how have these trended, and any kind of detail on how that\u2019s reflected in your 2Q gross margin, kind of your assumptions for stick and brick costs? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Sure. Build costs, they were stable in the first quarter, about $80 a square foot for base house. That\u2019s flat with Q4 of \u201923 and it\u2019s actually down from $84 a square foot in the first quarter of last year. As we look at \u201924, we expect cost inflation on labor and materials to be pretty manageable with low single digit increases, and we\u2019ve factored that into our guide. Andrew Azzi : Thank you so much, I appreciate it. Congrats on the quarter. Ryan Marshall : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with UBS Financial. Please go ahead. John Lovallo : Good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. The revised full-year gross margin outlook is about flat year-over-year, and I think previously you had talked about pricing being flat year-over-year - that was a little bit better in the first quarter, for sure, mid to high single digit land cost appreciation, kind of low single digit construction cost appreciation. Just curious how you guys are managing that to actually achieve a flat year-over-year gross margin in that kind of cost environment with what had previously been expected to be sort of flattish pricing. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, I think it\u2019s the strength of the market, John. We highlighted that we\u2019re raising prices in a number of our communities, that 1% to 5%. That\u2019s really the driver combined, certainly in this first quarter, with the mix differential that we had highlighted. John Lovallo : So is it pricing and mix a little bit better than previously expected? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, and just to be clear, John, the mix was really a Q1 issue. We think that smoothes out based on the relative strength of volume that Ryan highlighted out west, so we\u2019ll get more of that relatively lower margin profile in the back half of the year. John Lovallo : Okay, and that was sort of my follow-up. If we think about the positive mix impact of the first quarter, how much of the slight step-down from 29.6 to 29.2 in the gross margin outlook for the second quarter is the reversal of that mix impact, or is that really more of a back half phenomenon? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: It\u2019s both, right, but you\u2019ll see some of it in Q2 based on the sales that we did in the first quarter, and then you\u2019ll see more of it later in the year. That\u2019s part of the reason for the step-down in margin. The other thing that we highlighted on the call, we still have a lot of homes to sell for the back half of the year, and so the point we were making is it depends on how the demand environment holds up. If it does, that\u2019s good; if the market changed, you could see plus or minus depending on whether it\u2019s a positive change or a negative change. John Lovallo : Understood, thank you guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sam Reid with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Sam Reid : Awesome. Thanks so much, guys, for taking my questions, and thanks for the incremental color on April, especially the traffic detail. It definitely makes sense that the Centex buyer is a bit more rate-slash-payment sensitive, but I wanted to drill down on this a bit more and maybe see if you had any perspective on traffic across other parts of your business, that 60% that\u2019s kind of active adult and move-up, and what you\u2019re seeing from that buyer cohort, if anything, as rates move. Ryan Marshall : Sam, we\u2019re not parsing the traffic data quite that finely for the purpose of this call. One other data point that I will tell you, while we\u2019ve seen traffic into the stores moderate over the last several days, traffic to the website has been incredibly strong, so we still think that there\u2019s high buyer demand and desire for home ownership. Certainly any time there is rate fluctuations, it can cause some disruption in buyer behavior, but we think the fundamental--or the overall demand for housing remains incredibly strong, and we\u2019re still in a very supply constrained environment. The overall thesis about this has been a strong operating environment for the industry and this company in what\u2019s been a pretty high interest rate environment, we think the environment that we would expect for the balance of the year, we can continue to show success in that type of situation as well. Affordability, there\u2019s no question it is the headwind that we\u2019ll continue to navigate for the balance of the year, and we think we\u2019ve got the tools to do that. John Lovallo : That\u2019s helpful. Then maybe switching gears here, it\u2019s been a little while since this topic has come up, but can you talk to your relationship with Invitation on the single family rental side, and give us an update on where things stand, perhaps how many homes you\u2019re looking to sell to them this year. Any color there would be great, thanks. Ryan Marshall : Yes, we targeted--when we kind of kicked off the philosophy or the strategy that we had on single family rental with Invitation Homes, and we also partner with some other local single family rental operators as well, we\u2019ve targeted to be somewhere around 5% of our total volume would go into the single family rental channels. The current year, the closings that we have that will go into that pipeline are right in that 5% range. Certainly the interest rate environment currently, I think makes it harder for the single family rental operators to underwrite their deals. We wouldn\u2019t expect that to necessarily be the case forever, but in the right here and now a little harder to make those deals pencil for those SFR operators. It\u2019s part of the reason that we\u2019ve said we want it to be part of our business, but not such an outsized component that it creates disruptions in how we operate. John Lovallo : That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll pass it along, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Rafe Jadrosich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about on the cost side, what are you seeing today in terms of the cash costs for land and materials relative to what\u2019s flowing through your P&L, and what\u2019s kind of the outlook on the cost side. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Certainly on the materials side, it is pretty consistent, and as Jim highlighted, our build cost per foot flat. The only thing where we\u2019re really feeling any pressure there is on OSP, which has run up a little bit. In terms of the land, we\u2019ve highlighted that high single digit increase in lot costs - that is, candidly, continuing a theme that has been going on for a number of years and is likely to persist. I\u2019ve often described it as a conveyer belt of land - you know, three years of lots that we buy in any or control at any one point in time, and they kind of roll on, the most recent year falls off. Every new year coming on is a little bit more expensive, and that\u2019s a combination of increased land costs and increased development costs, but we haven\u2019t seen a step change in that, if that\u2019s really what you\u2019re focused on. Again, I think you can and should expect to see our lot costs going up for the foreseeable future. Rafe Jadrosich : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Then just looking at the first quarter gross margin, can you just talk about the drivers of the quarter, the 70 basis point quarter-over-quarter step-up, and then what were the upsides to your initial guidance? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Sorry, was that--are you asking sequentially or year-over-year? Rafe Jadrosich : Sequentially. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, so you\u2019ve got 70 basis points - certainly a part of that is going to be the strength of the--relative to our guide of the strength of the market, where for the spec homes that we sold, we got better pricing, which was a relative margin benefit over the fourth quarter. The other thing is the mix shift, not just in terms of geography, which we had highlighted, but on a sequential basis we also had a mix shift towards move-up, which has a higher margin profile relative to first-time, which is where the margin came from. I hate to use this, but there is mix and there\u2019s a couple of different mixes going on, but when you\u2019re looking at the sequential margin performance, certainly it\u2019s the strength of the market relative to what we thought coming into it, and also it\u2019s a little bit more move-up, which has a higher margin profile for us. Rafe Jadrosich : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mike Dahl : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019m going to stick with margins. Bob, you kind of alluded to this - it\u2019s a tricky time when you\u2019ve just had this rate move, you\u2019re maybe just on the front end of seeing some traffic impacts but you\u2019re having to give guide out a few quarters, and so I appreciate that there\u2019s still some uncertainty when you\u2019ve got a third of your full year closings yet to be sold. Maybe just talk through the assumption for flat incentives against this move in rates. Just talk about why that is the baseline assumption, or if it just felt like the right placeholders and matches what your backlog margins look like today. Maybe just a little more detail on how you went through this process at kind of an odd time, when the rate move just happened. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, it\u2019s interesting. I\u2019d refer back to something Ryan offered, which is the affordability is still a challenge. Against that backdrop, our expectation is that we will need to continue to incentivize folks, and the predominant way we\u2019re doing that today is through our national commitments and some sort of rate finance support. Our expectation is that that continues. That was our expectation coming into the year. In the first quarter, you heard us say it was 6.5% again, just like the fourth quarter - that\u2019s roughly $35,000, $40,000 a house. In a world where rates are actually trending back up, I think that we\u2019re going to need to continue to support that. It\u2019s a little bit challenging, to your point, but I think on balance, our expectation is that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to need to be to meet some of the affordability needs. It\u2019s one of the reasons we think you\u2019ll continue to see this strong market performance on a relative basis of new versus resale, because we can offer those incentives. Mike Dahl : I guess as my follow-up, more specifically, that kind of implies that you\u2019ll get your advertised rate flow up over time to match what the market move is and maintain your relative incentive, and so if you\u2019re allowing your rate to kind of float up, call it 40, 50 basis points from where it may have been a month or two ago, what have you done or seen in terms of thinking about sensitizing some of the recent demand trends, particularly in your Centex brand? I understand that it\u2019s not going to be a major--potentially not as major a dynamic for your move-up or active adult, but in your Centex brand, what\u2019s the sensitivity to a 40, 50 basis point move in rates that you\u2019ve seen or thought about? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, certainly for that true entry-level buyer, it\u2019s the game, right, and so we\u2019ve got programs that offer them lower cost incentives, so we\u2019re giving them more rate support relative to others who have choices. It\u2019s worth it to remember we offer a national program, but there\u2019s a lot of detail in terms of what we can and actually do offer to people and what they want to access in terms of our support. There will be some people with rates moving up that will literally fall off the ability to buy a home - that\u2019s not the case for our active adult and move-up buyers. Candidly, for a lot of our Centex buyers, you look at our average sales price at $419,000 in this most recent quarter, that\u2019s not typically your true entry level buyer - we\u2019re at a little bit higher price point. Our first time communities are typically a little bit closer in, and so I think it depends on who your buyer is, but to answer your question about will we vary our offering, the answer is yes. We have been. We are actively managing these national programs. We\u2019re buying commitments in relatively small amounts so that we don\u2019t get caught by market changes, and what it allows us to do is change our offering based on what the market is doing. As the market--as rates floated down, we moved our offer rate down somewhat to try and be responsive to deliver a real savings versus the street rate that they can get on their mortgage. As rates tick back up, we\u2019re moving those rates up a little bit. It\u2019s an art, not a science, but I think what you could expect us to do is listen to the consumers in terms of what they need and seek to offer them programs that give them what they need. Mike Dahl : Thanks Bob, appreciate that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Alan Ratner : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Nice quarter. Would love to get your updated thoughts on specs versus build to order. I know you and others ramped the spec production as cycle times re-elongated and there was a premium, or at least that margin differential spec versus BTO was kind of smaller than it historically has been. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re thinking about that any differently today with cycle times continuing to normalize and rates seemingly being higher for longer. It sounds like maybe the Centex offering, which is predominantly spec, I would think, is maybe seeing more of that impact than the move-up rate, so are you at the point now where you are kind of dialing back the spec starts a bit, or do you still want to maintain the current mix of your business? Ryan Marshall : We\u2019re pretty happy with where we\u2019re operating, and we look at a couple--I mean, the first thing we look at is what\u2019s the percentage of build-to-order versus spec sales. Right now, that\u2019s running around 50/50, and then we highlighted in Bob\u2019s prepared remarks, 40% of our width is spec, and we\u2019ve got a little bit higher than one final per active community. We pay attention to it closely. It\u2019s something we spend a lot of time managing and being responsive to what we\u2019re seeing in the market. To your point, most of our spec--our Centex business is spec. We certainly have a little bit of spec in the other two brands, but Pulte and Del Webb tend to be more of a build-to-order model, and we\u2019re certainly responsive to those as well. We\u2019re going to watch it, but in a higher interest rate environment, having available specs that you can more efficiently and effectively apply the most powerful incentive to in the form of the forward mortgage rate commitments, you can do that better on spec inventory, which makes it more attractive. You\u2019ll probably see us stay pretty close to where we\u2019re at. Alan Ratner : Great, appreciate your thoughts there, Ryan. Then pivoting to the incentive environment, I think obviously you guys certainly made the right call by not chasing the market lower in the fourth quarter, based on your performance this quarter. It sounds like from your guide for flattish incentives, you\u2019re not expecting to have to ramp discounts as the selling season moves into its later stages, but what is the sensitivity you\u2019re looking at there? How much longer will the more recent, I guess softer traffic trends, or maybe sales activity, how long would that have to persist before you would sit there and say, you know what, we need to maybe increase those incentives a little bit to bring up the sales pace? Is it a few months, is it getting past the peak of the selling season and you\u2019re sitting on more inventory than you\u2019d like? What\u2019s the decision process there look like? Ryan Marshall : Yes Alan, we look at sales rates every single day - it\u2019s one of the first emails that I look at, what did sales for the prior day come in at, and we look at qualitative and quantitative feedback that we get from our field operations in going through that decision making process. What I can tell you is the rate--the change in rage, nevermind what it was and nevermind what it\u2019s going to, just the mere fact something changed, we\u2019ve seen that cause pauses in buyer behavior over the last two or--you know, last 24 months. Anytime there\u2019s been a step change in rate and the media cycle that goes with it, that certainly has a pretty profound impact on buyer behavior. Time does seem to cure it. The only thing that I would continue to caveat and put out there is that affordability continues to be a real issue, and so we\u2019ve got to balance the change there. We think--you know, one of the things that we\u2019re going to continue to do is pay attention to what the headline rate is, and Bob talked about that a few questions ago. Our national mortgage rate incentives have got the flexibility to move based on what the market\u2019s doing, so we still think we can have a compelling offer out there relative to the street rate that doesn\u2019t necessarily cost us a whole bunch more, relative to what we\u2019re currently paying. The last piece, Alan, is we are going to keep our production machine moving. We are a production builder and we\u2019re going to do that in a way that we think optimizes kind of returns, so if there are price changes or discount changes that ultimately have an impact on affordability, that allow us to continue to turn the asset and keep the market share that we have, we\u2019ll definitely do that. Alan Ratner : Thanks a lot for the thoughts, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : We have reached the end of the call, and we\u2019ll take our final question from Ken Zener with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. Ken Zener : Good morning everybody. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hey Ken. Ken Zener : Wonder if you could just give some context on the regional comments you made, and I want to narrow it down to Florida because it\u2019s a segment that obviously generates quite a bit of your EBIT. Can you, within Florida, talk about how that existing market supply rising affected, let\u2019s say, the Centex versus your move-up brand, realizing Orlando is different than coastal markets? It\u2019s such a big market for you guys profitability-wise. If you could maybe give a little color related to the margin swings you\u2019re kind of seeing with those trade-up buyers\u2019 entry within markets that are seeing the pick-up in inventory specific to Florida, thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes Ken, I want to make sure that I understood kind of the full question. Maybe I\u2019ll give you a little bit of Florida commentary and then if there\u2019s more follow-up, I\u2019ll let you ask that. Florida is a tremendous part of our business. We\u2019re in nearly every major housing market there save Miami. A big part of our business there tends to be focused on move-up and age targeted. We have some entry-level business in our Tampa and Orlando businesses, but the other big markets are predominantly move-up and age targeted. We get a little bit of move-up in Jacksonville as well--or a little bit of entry-level on Jacksonville as well, so. Really strong business, a lot of job relocation there, a lot of folks that want to be there because they\u2019ve got flexible work arrangements that allow them to work from home or work from elsewhere. The headwinds in Florida are definitely affordability - we\u2019ve seen strong price appreciation in most Florida markets, and then the other headwind that you\u2019ve got there is around property taxes and insurance. Certainly those things kind of play into that, but Florida continues to be a big part of our business and a real bright spot for our business as well. Ken Zener : That was sufficient, thank you very much. Operator : I will now turn the conference back over to Jim Zeumer for closing remarks. James Zeumer : Great, appreciate everybody\u2019s time today. We\u2019re around the remainder of the day for ay follow-up questions, and we will look forward to speaking with you at various upcoming conferences and/or on our next quarter\u2019s earnings call. Thanks for your time. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by and welcome to the PulteGroup's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor relations. You may begin. James Zeumer : Great. Thanks, Rob. I want to welcome everyone to PulteGroup's earnings call to discuss our strong financial performance for our second quarter ended June 30th, 2024. Here to review PulteGroup's Q2 results are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. Copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll post an audio replay of this call later today. I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. PulteGroup delivered another quarter of strong financial results, which reflect an approach to the business in which we seek to balance price, pace and investment over the long-term to generate superior returns. Consistent with this strategy, our financial results continue to show the power of capitalizing on the value of each lot and home we sell. Our divisions work extremely hard to secure, entitle and develop our land assets and work equally hard to generate exceptional profitability, while still turning our portfolio at an appropriate rate. Specific to our second quarter performance, we realized a 2% increase in average sales price, an 8% increase in closings, and a 30 basis point gain in gross margin, which in aggregate, helped drive a 19% increase in earnings to a second quarter record of $3.83 per share. Another quarter of overall strong financial performance, highlighted by our double-digit earnings growth, resulted in PulteGroup generating a return on equity of 27.1% for the trailing 12-month period. Obviously, a key driver of our strong financial results and high returns on invested capital continues to be the company's outstanding gross margins. As Bob will discuss, gross margins in the period benefited from a favorable mix of closings, but I would also highlight the pricing strength evident in our numbers. In Q2, product options and lot premiums averaged $104,000 per home and represented approximately 19% of our average sales price of $549,000. As I'm sure you can all appreciate, options and lot premiums are high-margin dollars and an important contributor to PulteGroup's outsized margins relative to peers. I know how hard our employees work to deliver such outstanding results and I want to thank our entire organization for their efforts. As good as our second quarter numbers are, it's fair to say that as we navigated through the period, demand was a little less consistent than we experienced in the first quarter of 2024. On our Q1 earnings call, we noted buyer traffic had slowed the first few weeks of April. While subsequent Wall Street channel checks confirmed a change in short-term demand, the fact remains that we are operating in a housing market that has been underbuilt relative to population, immigration and household formation for more than a decade. The resulting housing deficit of several million homes is likely a structural reality for years to come, given the zoning challenges we face in most municipalities. Our country's underlying new home supply issue has been exacerbated by the lock-in effect caused by the dramatic rise in interest rates over the last two years. What the market continues to experience is existing homeowners who are unwilling or more likely unable to give up the low rate mortgages originated several years ago. As a consequence, the inventory of quality existing homes remains below long-term averages in many markets. The supply imbalance is one of the reasons that I am confident in the long-term demand trends for housing in this country, but I'd appreciate that buyer demand will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. For example, the bump in interest rates in the second quarter caused some buyers to become more cautious, while others saw affordability stretched beyond their financial capacity. While many cities are facing a limited supply of homes for sale, we have seen an increase in existing and new home supply in select markets in Florida and Texas. These markets are now in the process of finding the new clearing price needed to work down any excess inventory. Maybe more impactful than rates and inventory, the feedback we are getting points to a lack of confidence among some consumers that now is a good time to buy. High prices, higher interest rates and the resulting high monthly payments are making potential buyers more cautious in purchasing a new home. To the degree that this lack of confidence among consumers reflects affordability concerns, this isn't new, and in fact, it's something we address on a market-by-market, even community-by-community basis every day. It was more than a year ago that you first heard me say that delivering high returns requires that we turn our assets and that we won't be margin proud. In an environment where market conditions are more competitive, we have worked to ensure that our products, prices and incentives are clearly meeting buyer needs. Consistent with this focus on turning our assets, we continue to build a more efficient and faster turning land pipeline. In the quarter, lots controlled via option increased to 53% of total lots. We are successfully building on our historic base of lots option directly with the land sellers by increasing our use of third-party land bankers. To-date, we have entered into transactions representing almost 13,000 lots and $1.5 billion of capital. As with all land-related activities, we are being disciplined in how we expand this part of our portfolio, but we are making steady progress in assembling a more efficient land pipeline. As we sit here at the midpoint of 2024, I would say that it is shaping up to be a very good year for Pulte. Relative to our expectations coming into 2024, not only did we raise our initial closing guide by 1,000 homes, but we are clearly on a gross margin path well above our initial guide. For various reasons, market conditions got a little tougher in the second quarter, but we continue to actively manage price, pace and starts to drive the best business outcome. Based on the current demand conditions and construction cycle times, we continue to start homes at a pace consistent with closing 31,000 homes this year, as well as positioning the company to grow 5% to 10% in 2025, consistent with the multiyear outlook we have discussed previously. Through the first few weeks of July, traffic to our communities has been solid, but depending on how demand conditions and absorption paces evolve up or down in each market over the balance of the year, we will adjust our starts pace as needed. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our second quarter results. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. PulteGroup generated second quarter home sale revenues of $4.4 billion, which represents an increase of 10% over the second quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues for the period was driven by an 8% increase in closings to 8,097 homes, in combination with a 2% increase in our average sales price to $549,000. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in our ASP reflects modest price increases in our first-time and active adult communities, while prices in our move-up communities were consistent with last year. The increase in our average sales prices for the quarter also reflects the impact of mix, as we recorded higher closings within our move-up business, which at $650,000 carried much higher prices than our first-time and active adult business. Broken down by buyer group, closings in the second quarter consisted of 40% first-time, 37% move-up and 23% active adult. This compares with the mix of closings in the second quarter of last year, which was 41% first-time, 34% move-up and 25% active adult. Reflecting the headwinds caused by higher rates and other market dynamics, our 7,649 net new orders were down 4% from last year's exceptionally strong results. In particular, I would highlight that last year's Q2 orders benefited from Del Webb grand opening and built-for-rent sales that are lumpy in nature. As has been well reported, operating conditions in select Florida and Texas markets got more competitive in the second quarter as interest rates rose during the month of April. On our first quarter earnings call this year, we indicated that buyer traffic had slowed during the first few weeks of April and this slowdown did ultimately impact orders as we moved through the period. For the second quarter, our average community count was 934, which is an increase of 3% over the same period last year. The resulting absorption pace of 2.7 orders per community per month in the quarter is above the pre-COVID average, but down from the 2.9 we generated last year. More granularly, our net new orders in the second quarter decreased 3% among first-time buyers, increased 4% among move-up buyers, and decreased 17% among active adult buyers. While we continue to see strong demand among active adult buyers, we did report a larger year-over-year decrease in their second quarter quarters. That decrease primarily reflects lower community count in the current year and some impact from the timing of openings and closings of several of our Del Webb communities. Adjusting for the impact of these dynamics, our net new orders at stores that were operating consistently in both periods shows an order decrease of only 3%. Consistent with our overall order results, on a unit basis, our quarter end backlog was down 4% to 12,982 homes, although backlog value was down only 1% to $8.1 billion. Turning to production. We started at approximately 8,100 homes in the second quarter and ended the quarter with a total of 17,250 homes under construction. Of the 17,250 homes under construction, approximately 6,900 or 40% of spec, including an average of 1.3 finished specs per community. These levels are in line with our targets of 40% and one finished spec per community and put us in a position to meet our delivery targets over the balance of the year. As always, we are prepared to adjust our cadence of spec starts up or down in response to sustained changes in overall higher demand. Based on the units we have under construction and their stage of production, we currently expect to close between 7,400 and 7,800 homes in the third quarter and continue to expect to close approximately 31,000 homes for the full year. As noted, we realized an average sales price of $549,000 in the second quarter, which is consistent with our prior guide for pricing of $540,000 to $550,000. Looking ahead, we expect closings in the third and fourth quarters to be in that same range of $540,000 to $550,000. While our average price and backlog is higher than our guide, we have a lot of homes left to sell and close this year, most of which will be spec production with our first-time buyer communities where pricing is lower. We reported second quarter gross margin of 29.9%, which represents an increase of 30 basis points over both the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. As in Q1 of this year, our reported gross margins reflect a favorable mix of closings and a generally supportive pricing environment for many of the spec sales we closed in the quarter. Second quarter gross margins also benefited from opportunities we've taken in prior quarters to improve net pricing in a number of communities across our portfolio. Consistent with such actions, incentives on closings in the second quarter was 6.3% selling price, which is down from 6.5% in the first quarter of this year. While recent macro data has sparked optimism about the potential for Fed rate cuts, we don't factor such expectations into our guidance. What we do know is that rates remain elevated, affordability is stretched, and our delivery mix will be less favorable in the back half of the year. As we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, in the third and fourth quarters, we will be closing more homes in our West region, where homes carry a lower relative margin profile than we did in the first half of the year. These factors, combined with our need to be price competitive to turn assets point to an expected gross margin of approximately 29% in the third quarter and 28.5% to 29% in the fourth quarter. As stated previously, we still have homes to sell and close to meet our full-year delivery guide of 31,000 units. So, demand conditions over the next few months can have an impact on the results built. In the second quarter, our reported SG&A expense was $361 million, or 8.1% of home sale revenues. Reported SG&A includes a $52 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in the period. In Q2 of last year, our reported SG&A expense was $315 million, or 7.8% of home sale revenue, which includes a $65 billion pre-tax insurance benefit. Excluding the impact of the insurance benefits recorded in the first two quarters of this year, we continue to expect SG&A expense for the full year to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Turning to our financial services operations. We reported pre-tax income of $63 million in the second quarter, which is up from $46 million in the same period last year. The 36% increase in pre-tax income reflects strong financial performance across all business lines, including mortgage, title and insurance. Our performance also benefited from an increase in capture rates across all business lines, including a mortgage capture rate of 86% in the quarter, up from 80% last year. In total, reported pre-tax income for the second quarter was $1 billion, which represents an increase of 10% over last year. Our tax expense in the second quarter was $239 million, with an effective tax rate of 22.8%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter includes the benefit of energy tax credits and a $13 million benefit related to the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters. For the remaining quarters this year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. Taken altogether, we reported net income of $809 million or $3.83 per share. This compares to prior year reported net income of $720 million, or $3.21 per share. On a per share basis, we continue to benefit from our ongoing share repurchase program, which on a year-over-year basis reduced shares outstanding by 5% from last year. Capitalizing on our strong cash flows, we continue to support the future growth of our business as we invested approximately $1.2 billion in land acquisition and development in the second quarter. This brings our year-to-date land spend to just over $2.3 billion, keeping us on track to invest approximately $5 billion in land acquisition and development for the full year. For both the quarter and the first six months of 2024, the allocation of land spend was 60% development and 40% acquisition. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 225,000 lots under control, of which 53% were held via option. Given the strength of our land pipeline, we continue to forecast community count growth of 3% to 5% in the third and fourth quarters of this year over the comparable prior periods last year. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we are also continuing to return capital to shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million common shares at a cost of $314 million, or an average price of $113.79 per share. This brings our year-to-date share repurchase activity to a total of 5.1 million shares repurchased at a cost of $560 million or $110.58 per share. In addition to repurchasing stock, we also completed a tender offer for $300 million of our senior notes in the second quarter. As a result, our debt-to-capital ratio is now just 12.8% and our notes payable have decreased to $1.7 billion, which represents the lowest level since before we acquired Del Webb in 2001. After spending more than $1.8 billion during the quarter on land investment and the purchase of our equity and debt, we ended the quarter with more than $1.4 billion of cash. Adjusting for our cash position, our net debt-to-capital ratio at the quarter end was 1.8%. I'm also pleased to report that in acknowledgement of our improved operations, strong cash flow generation and outstanding balance sheet, Fitch recently upgraded our debt to BBB+, while Moody's upgraded its outlook to positive. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. During the first half of 2024, traffic to our communities was good and absorption pace ran slightly above historic norms. So, I feel good about our opportunities in the back half of the year. To the degree that the Fed actually cuts interest rates in the coming months, I think that will provide a powerful tailwind both financially and psychologically as we enter 2025. Before turning the call back to Jim, I would draw your attention to a release we issued a couple of weeks ago about one of our newest community openings and our first in Utah in more than 20 years. Along with representing PulteGroup's reentry into my home state, Utah is the seventh greenfield new market entry we have initiated over the past few years. Through the first half of 2024, we increased home sale revenues by 10% and grew reported earnings per share by 25% over the last year. Over the same period, we increased our land investment by 31% to $2.3 billion, while increasing year-to-date share repurchases and dividend payments by 37% to $645 million. We also retired $300 million of debt. PulteGroup has executed extremely well and with expectations of closing 31,000 homes for the full year, we are in excellent position to drive strong results going forward. And finally, before opening the call to questions, I want to briefly address the press release we issued yesterday announcing our CFO succession plans. After a truly impactful 13-year career with PulteGroup, Bob O'Shaughnessy has initiated a transition toward retirement at the end of 2025. Step one in this process is that Bob will relinquish his title as Chief Financial Officer effective early February of next year. I'm pleased to say that Bob will then remain with us for another 10 months as Executive Vice President. During that time, he will support a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities, as well as continue to oversee our financial services business, our strategic partnerships and our asset management committee. Since its founding, PulteGroup's greatest strength has always been the talented people who work here. Reflecting this depth of exceptional people, I'm proud to announce that Jim Ossowski, currently Senior Vice President of Finance, has been named as the company's next CFO. Jim has had an outstanding 22-year career at PulteGroup, during which time he has served as VP of Finance and Corporate Controller, VP of Finance, Homebuilding Operations, Area VP of Finance and Director of Corporate Audit. In his current role as SVP of Finance, he manages our critical asset management committee and FP&A function. Jim has been promoted to Executive Vice President and CFO effective February of 2025. At that time, Jim will report directly to me and will have responsibility for our accounting, tax, audit, risk management and treasury functions. In announcing these changes now, we ensure having plenty of time to implement a seamless transition of responsibilities. Now, let me turn the call back to Jim. James Zeumer : Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. And I'll ask Rob to again explain the process and we'll open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Stephen Kim : Yeah. Thanks very much guys. Congrats on the results and congrats to Jim and Bob. I'm glad to hear that we got a great transition going. So, congrats to everybody. Wanted to ask a couple of questions. If I could start off just by talking about your gross margin outlook. You indicated that you're going to be doing more in the West, I think, which is a little bit lower margin. And you also talked about, on a longer-term basis, increasing your land banking initiative. I was wondering if you could give us a sense. If you were to isolate the land banking, the increased use of land bankers, I know that this is going to take a little time to kind of flow through all your results. But once that has happened and you reach the targeted level that you think land banking is going to represent in your mix, how much of a margin impact overall do you think that, that alone would represent relative to where you are today? Ryan Marshall : Yeah. Stephen, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. Maybe the first part of the question about the margin in the balance of the year related to the West. We mentioned last quarter and it's continued into this quarter. The West has performed better than it had in kind of prior periods. So, we've got a heavier mix of West Coast closings coming through. Those margins on a relative basis are a little bit lower. And so we've factored that into the margin guide that we've given for Q3 and Q4. The margins are, I think, you'll agree, incredibly, incredibly strong at the levels that we've guided to. As it relates to land banking, we're making great progress. The goal that we've kind of laid out is to get from the historical 50% options that we've been running at to 70%. That incremental kind of 20% move was going to be done with land bankers. I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we're making great progress. It's steady, it's deliberate, and we're absolutely on the path to get to 70%. In terms of the trade between margin and return, that's what we typically look at is we're looking. What we're ultimately looking for is we're looking for transfer of risk. And with that, we typically see somewhere between 200 basis points to 300 basis point trade between margin and return. Every deal is unique. So to paint it with any more of a broad brush than that, I think wouldn't be fair. And then the closing comment I'd make is -- and I know you know this, Stephen, but we underwrite return, not the margins. Return is what we believe ultimately drives shareholder value. Stephen Kim : Absolutely. That's very helpful. That 20% increase in the 200 basis points to 300 basis points, which is also pretty standard across the industry. So, that's helpful. Wanted to talk about cycle times because also when you talk about returns being able to build more quickly and therefore more efficiently also helps you in your return goals. Can you update us on where your cycle times sit today relative to, let's say, a pre-pandemic kind of a situation? And if you think there's additional opportunities there and wrapped up in that, can you give us an update on ICG? It's been a while since we've kind of heard you talk about it. You've had it now for over about four years, I think. Just give us a sense for sort of where that fits into the overall cycle time progression? Robert O'Shaughnessy: It's a great question, Stephen. So, cycle time days in the quarter on closings were 123 days. So, that's a pickup of about a week from where we were in Q1. I would say, today, we've got a number of divisions where the cycle times are at or below kind of that 100-day target that we've set for ourselves. But we do still have some divisions where it's elevated. I see trade availability is probably what's holding some of those divisions back. Looking forward, as we look to the end of the year, we'll probably be slightly elevated over that 100-day target that we set. But we're working hard and we think we can get there in the first half of '25. Ryan Marshall : Stephen, it's Ryan again. I'll take the ICG question. We're pleased with how ICG is performing. We've got two active plants, both located in the Southeast part of the US. They do a mix of our business, along with other single-family homebuilder business. And we have a decent amount of commercial business that runs through those plants as well, predominantly in the frame package for apartments. If there was a part of the ICG business that's lagging, it would be that commercial business with the slowdown in new apartment development or new apartment projects starting. We do have a physical location secured and owned. Actually, more than secured. We own a location for our third ICG plant. We have not started construction on that yet. We're just finalizing some of the design parameters for that new location. So as we have more details on that, we'll be sure to share it. We're pleased with not only the cycle time benefits that we get out of ICG, the quality pickups, better safety. We also think we get better cost just in the way that we're able to buy, particularly lumber as it flows into the ICG plant. So happy with how that business is performing. Stephen Kim : Okay. Great. Appreciate all the color, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from UBS. Your line is open. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. You spoke about the uptick in inventory on the existing home side in certain markets like Southwest Florida and I think, Texas, you mentioned. Are these levels concerning to you? Are there any markets where that inventory is concerning? And are you seeing more of an impact on your move-up business versus your entry level? Or how would you kind of characterize that? Ryan Marshall : Yeah, John, it's a good question. Probably the one market that's higher than what we'd ideally like to see would be Southwest Florida. There we've seen inventory -- resale inventory levels approach about nine months, with the benchmark or the kind of equilibrium rate being six months. So, we're a tad elevated. I wouldn't consider it concerning. That's been a very strong market for a long time. I think it continues to be a really desirable place for retirees and second homeowners. So, I think that market had unprecedented price appreciation. Part of the reason that I think we're seeing some of the elevated inventory levels. The market will go through a bit of an adjustment. It will find a clearing price and I'd expect inventory levels to come back to kind of a more normal range. There are a few markets in Texas that I think are in similar situation. Austin, Dallas would be the two that I would probably highlight. That I have also seen unprecedented growth in population, jobs, and resulting home price increases. But other than the nine months of inventory in Southwest Florida, there's probably nothing that I'd characterize as concerning. Robert O'Shaughnessy: One thing I might add to that. It's worth it to remember if they're selling a home more often than not, that's also a buyer. So it's not really net supply add to the market. It can influence pricing as much as anything else. And retail has always been our biggest competitor. We always have -- we have the advantage today of being able to offer rate incentives to the buyers. So for the demand that's there, we are a compelling choice first of that resale inventory. John Lovallo : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the cash flow, is $1.8 billion still the cash flow guide for the full year? You guys did, I think, $246 million of buybacks in the first quarter, another $314 million in the second quarter. How are you kind of thinking about that cash flow in the back half and the ability to repurchase more shares? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Well, certainly, our cash flow guide is still current. And I think we've historically not given a view as to how much we're going to be repurchasing in the forward periods. We've let our kind of actions speak for themselves. You can and should expect to see us continue to be in market. John Lovallo : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Your line is open. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning and congratulations to Bob and Jim. You indicated your guidance doesn't anticipate lower rates. And I'm just wondering, if benchmark mortgage rates were to fall 50 bps or 100 bps, is it possible to quantify what that would do to gross margin holding all else equal? And then maybe kind of a harder question to answer, do you get a sense that there's meaningful group of prospective buyers that are kind of on the sidelines until we get a move in rates? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes. It's an interesting question and I wish I had a perfect answer for you, but a lot of it will depend on what is prompting that decline in rates, right? We've talked about this before. If the economy is healthy, lower rates are good because it means that the consumer's wallet is still healthy and they still have a job and the lower interest rate environment allows them to save some money. I think in that environment, we would expect to see margins a tailwind because our incentive load likely goes down. If it is in concert with that, we're worried about recessionary impacts, GDP, not healthy jobs, not as solid as they are today. That has another influence. The other thing that factors into this is supply, right? We talked about it in some markets. It's a little bit more competitive. And so there could be a scenario where we've made it clear we want to sell homes, and we're going to find the price that's going to get there. While we may be able to save a little bit of money on the incentive for the financing, we may be in a position where we're giving some of that in some other form of incentive. So like I said, I don't know, Ryan, if you want to comment, but the broader environment is important to that is just what happened to rates. We've always said rates are interesting, but they are only one element of the consumer equation. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. And then sorry if I missed this, but in terms of stick and brick costs in the quarter and then what your maybe second half gross margin guidance assume or contemplates, can you just give us kind of color on those trends? Robert O'Shaughnessy: So the stick and brick costs in the second quarter were $80 per square foot. That's flat with the first quarter of this year. As we look ahead, we expect inflation to be manageable maybe low single-digits over the balance of the year backing us. James Ossowski : And that's incorporated into the guide that we've provided. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Maybe worth highlighting I think Jim's referencing primarily vertical. The land costs, we've talked about kind of high single-digit increases through '24 also embedded in that guide. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and I also want to offer my congrats to Bob and Jim. First, I wanted to circle back to the comments around the shift of the business over time to more lot optioning and just wanted to kind of clarify the comments earlier, you said that when you kind of move from a regular perhaps owned land position to a lot bank land position. I just want to make sure we understood that right, that it kind of shifts 200 to 300 basis points of gross margin, take that out of gross margin, but shifts it into return on equity, if we heard that right. And if we're talking about a 20% shift of the business, effectively 200 to 300 bps times 20%, we're talking about 40 to 60 bps impact of moving from gross margin to ROE. Just want to make sure that we're understanding that correctly. And if there's any other factors that we should consider in that longer-term move to more lot optioning and land banking? Ryan Marshall : Hey, Mike, it's Ryan. I think the way you've articulated is accurate. So I think you're understanding it right. I would reiterate that the 50% that we have in our business today of land options. Those are land options with the underlying seller and that's been the case for the last seven or eight years. So that's not a change. And going forward, we'd expect that to remain in that kind of 50-ish percent range. So the incremental optionality taking us from 50 to 70, that's the piece that will have more land banking in it. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Maybe just one point of clarification. I'd rather we're speaking to the IRR on the transaction as opposed to our return on equity. Like our equity gets influenced by lots of other things ultimately when you kind of get to the parent level. But on a deal-by-deal basis, banks versus nonbank, it is roughly a 200 to 300 basis point cost and margin and then a roughly 200 to 300 basis point benefit to the return on that transaction. Michael Rehaut : Right. That's very helpful. And I think it's important to clarify that. Secondly, maybe looking at the balance sheet, I believe you still are kind of running below your target levels, which, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe are the 20% to 30% debt-to-cap ratio, net debt more or less around zero the last several quarters. How should we think about the potential to maybe even getting that leverage back to your targeted range? What's the potential for that? I think as you're kind of entering perhaps even a more of a tailwind type of macro backdrop to the extent that rates start coming down, how should we think about the balance sheet and the ability, particularly as you're shifting more and more towards lot optioning? What is the right amount of leverage. And to the extent that there's a potential to increase share repurchase as we've been thinking about this with other companies. How should we think about that for Pulte in the next several years? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, the way that I'd ask you to think about capital allocation is we look at the needs of the business first and foremost. And that starts with how much investment do we want to put into land? How much investment do we want to put into dividends? How much investment do we want to put into share repo and as evidenced in over the last couple of years, we've even been retiring debt. So we look at the collective needs of the business and then we think about how are we going to finance that. The business is performing incredibly well, and we've been generating great cash flow and that cash flow put us in a very favorable position where we haven't needed the levels of debt that we've historically used in the business. So I think we can all agree that having an appropriate amount of leverage in a business is advantageous and efficient from a return standpoint. That's part of the reason that we set kind of our target rate at 20% to 30%. But we're not going to let the tail wag the dog here. We look at how we want to run the business, think about the capital that we need for that and then we look at how we're going to finance it. And in the position that we're in, we're in a great position to have lower leverage, lower debt and still do all of the things that we want to do strategically from an investment standpoint. So I take the position that we're in from an overall debt level any day of the week and twice on Sunday. Could the business absorb or handle more debt certainly but again, the number one priority is how do we want to run the business and then we go figure out how to finance it. Bob, anything else do you want to add to that? Robert O'Shaughnessy: No, other than that furthering Ryan's point, as we get a more efficiently on pipeline, i.e., more optionality, I think, we get to a point where our cash flows better match our earnings. So less of the cyclicality on the balance sheet and the impact on cash flows from inventory changes, which is that the environment we operate today is going to generate a lot of cash. So it's not likely that we would be levering from here. Michael Rehaut : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Your line is open. Rafe Jadrosich : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to follow-up on some of the comments on Florida and Texas. Can you talk about what you would sort of attribute the slowdown and the higher inventory in those markets too? Like what's driving that? And then the comments on the price discovery process, where are we in that process? Have you seen prices correct already? Or is that something you would expect going forward? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Rafe, thanks for the question. I think what's created some of the increase in inventory is the unprecedented rise in price, which has caused some owners to become sellers for whatever reason. Those high prices have created a bit of an affordability challenge that prospective buyers are struggling to kind of digest at this point. So as I mentioned on one of the prior questions, I think what happens here, there'll be a little bit of a kind of price market clearing price adjustment process that will happen over time. I think it takes a terribly long time. But over the next probably three, six, nine months, I would expect that market to kind of work through some of the buildup of inventory. I'd point you to as an example, Austin. If you looked at the Austin market going back probably two years ago, a couple of years post-COVID unprecedented job growth, combined with unprecedented rise in sales prices, all of a sudden, the market kind of came to a bit of a slowdown. We saw build in inventory. It took about six months for the market to kind of work through some of that inventory and it settled back into kind of a more normal run rate growth rate. So my expectation would be probably for something similar to happen as it relates to Southwest Florida. Rafe Jadrosich : Thank you. That's really helpful. And then just on the gross margin guidance for the second half of the year, I think you were previously expecting sort of consistent 29% and through the back half, the expectation for the change in the outlook for the fourth quarter for sort of the exit rate, is that driven entirely by mix? Or are there other factors that are changing that expectation for the fourth quarter? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes. It's really a combination of two primary things. One is it's the mix that we've highlighted. And to a degree, we saw that coming. So it was in the 29 area that we had given back at the end of the first quarter, but that has continued. So we've got a bigger mix kind of number than we saw 90 days ago. And really, we've highlighted the market's gotten a little bit choppier and so we see that there's likely to be a little bit more incentive. We told you we've got homes to sell and close. And so we're projecting that into our guide as well. I think it's worth highlighting the range that we've given now is a little bit lower, but it includes that same point that we had been at the beginning -- at the end of the first quarter. So I don't want anybody to misconstrue. We don't see a big change in market. This is really just kind of circumstance driven. Rafe Jadrosich : Thanks for all the color. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Rafe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Alan Ratner : Hey guys. Good morning. My congrats to Bob and Jim as well. So I'm actually going to take kind of the opposite side of the margin question because I actually think the guidance is pretty similar to your prior guide when you kind of consider the moving pieces with the upside this quarter, what seems like a bit of a mix shift in the back half of the year. And I guess I was hoping you might reconcile that a little bit with the comments on Texas and Florida because those two states are a pretty sizable part of your business, over 40% of closings. And it sounds like you're kind of bracing maybe for a little bit of an incentive war, that's probably too strong of a word, but in the back half of the year in order to generate some volume. So I guess, my question or interpretation of the guidance is it feels like you're not necessarily factoring in that much of an incentive headwind in the back half of the year. So can you just kind of talk through that a little bit? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan, I think Bob's prior answer to Ray's question help to address that. Now I'd combine that with the comment that I made that we're not going to be margin proud. It's important for us to turn our assets, the demand environment and specifically, consumer confidence and affordability has been a little bit choppier. So the combination of a little bit more West Coast mix with a few markets where we think we're going to have to add in a few incremental incentives. We've given kind of some incremental or some more kind of finite range and where we think margins fall in Q4. The guide for Q3, we left unchanged at approximately 29%, and we just put a range around the fourth quarter to accommodate for some of the things that I just described. Alan Ratner : Okay. That's helpful. It just seems like it's pretty -- not too dissimilar from the outlook three months ago, even though maybe there's a little bit more conservatism in your outlook from what it sounds like at least in those two states. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Well, Alan, maybe just one other point, I mean, we've got 13,000 units of backlog, the vast majority of which are going to deliver over the next six months. So we could see a lot of that. And to your point about forward incentive load, we already know what the incentives are on those homes. So it's really just -- Alan Ratner : Got it. Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Second question is just a bit of a bigger picture, higher-level question. Some of your peers have kind of put out reset long-term absorption targets for the business and kind of raise that maybe from where the businesses have run historically. And those are for various reasons, maybe more of a spec mix, more entry level or just kind of just better efficiencies. I'm curious, as you look at your return focus and obviously, the very strong margins, but the commentary about not being margin proud, is there an opportunity longer term to take the absorption run rate of your business higher compared to where it's run historically? And how much margin, if any, do you have to give up to achieve that? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan. I think the thing that I would probably reorient the focus would be around how difficult it is to have entitled land in this country. We're in an environment that is largely not in my backyard anti-growth environment both municipalities. So the land that we have entitled and we're able to develop become somewhat of a precious commodity, and we're treating it as such. And we're treating it as such and balancing pace and price to drive the best returns that we can because we fundamentally believe that's what creates shareholder value. And I think the last decade of performance from this company demonstrates just that. Growth is a very important part of our story. And it's part of the reason that in our last quarter, we laid out a multiyear growth target of 5% to 10% over a multiyear period. So for 2024, we're going to be at the higher end of that range for the business that we'll deliver in 2024. And then in my prepared remarks, I highlighted that for 2025, we'd expect to be kind of within that range. So the way we've been investing capital, the way that we've been thinking about kind of community level absorption and total volume deliveries out of the business are very much aligned with that 5% to 10% multi-year growth target. And I'd probably leave it there as opposed to going into by community absorption rates. Alan Ratner : Makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the comments. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Alan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sam Reid from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Sam Reid : Awesome. Thanks so much, guys. One more question on Florida here. Just wanted to maybe hear your perspective or your latest perspective, I guess, I should say, on the insurance market. You generally build houses that are further inland obviously, to the latest building codes. But are you finding that higher insurance rates across the state are also potentially a driver behind some of the buyer trepidation there? Just wanted your perspective on that. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Sam, I think it's something that the entire country is grappling with, not just Florida. I think we've seen insurance rates go up in a number of states. Certainly, the issues are maybe more acute in the Florida markets. We are fortunate that we've got our own insurance agency. They do an amazing job. We have high capture rate and they're able to provide, not only provide insurance coverage, but to do it at a very attractive rate for the buyers that are buying in our communities. To your point, our homes are built to the most up-to-date code. They're more resilient, both in terms of building materials, but also in terms of how they handle rain events and kind of rising water type events because of the way that we manage land development, on-site retention, drainage, et cetera. So I think it's not to be dismissed, but it's not something that's having an impact on our ability to sell homes. The other thing that I would kind of highlight at least with a lot of Florida buyers, typically, you've got somebody that already lives in Florida. They're selling the home in Florida, and they might be moving to another location. So they've had insurance. They've been paying on a relative basis, higher insurance rates. And so there's not necessarily a shock there. There's also, as it relates to buyers that are coming in from outside of the State of Florida. They may be on a relative basis to where they're leaving, they might be paying higher rates, but there are other benefits that they might be picking up in terms of lower property tax rates, no state income tax. So there is some -- you don't have to shovel snow and things like that. So there's some puts and takes to insurance rates. Sam Reid : No, that helps. And then just maybe switching gears and touching on land really quickly here. And this is more of a clarification question. It sounds like you're talking to more of a high single-digit increase in land costs this year. At least that's what's hitting your P&L and flowing through the gross margin. First of all, I just want to make sure I'm hearing that correctly. And then does that represent any change from your earlier your commentary? Because I believe the original expectation was for that to be closer to, let's call it, mid to high single-digits. Just want to make sure we're thinking of that correctly. Thanks. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Apologies if we weren't clear. We haven't changed our cost estimates for land. I may be guilty of saying high single-digits versus mid to high single-digits. It means the same thing. And I apologize, it's somewhere between 5% and 10%. Sam Reid : Got you. That helps. Thanks so much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Dahl : Good morning. Thanks and congrats, Bob and Jim. Bob, I guess you're not free of us all quite yet. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Not quite yet. Michael Dahl : Sometimes. A couple of quick ones from my end. You characterized the July traffic as solid. Obviously, some moving pieces around rates over the past month and then normal seasonality, you would flow. I think your absorption would typically be down kind of mid-teens quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. Just given all the kind of attention from investors and analysts like can you give a little more clarity on kind of how the beginning of 3Q has looked? And are you trying to characterize this as kind of against what was choppy, solid is consistent with what you'd expect that are worth. How would you further clarify that? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, it's always tricky when we're giving qualitative descriptions about three weeks of traffic in July. So we try to choose our words carefully. The second quarter, I think, you've heard from us and you've heard from others that have reported. It was choppy throughout the quarter. But things in early July, three weeks in, have been solid, and we're pleased with kind of how the business is performing. And probably the biggest thing that I'd want you to focus on is kind of our reaffirmation of how we view the business for the entire year, our start rate, what we believe we can deliver and kind of how that sets us up for kind of 2025. So certainly, three weeks of kind of data in July, I know they're important. I know there's a lot of focus on it. But I think the bigger picture of what's the full year of '24 are going to look like, how are we thinking about 2025. Those are the things that I think are probably more important. Michael Dahl : Yes. Okay. Understood and fair. And then just sorry to keep going on kind of the Florida and Texas stuff, but just as kind of a level setting exercise. If we look at the orders, your Florida orders were down 9%, your Texas down 8% in the quarter. Is there any way you could give us some additional perspective on in those challenged markets in Southwest Florida and Austin, Dallas? How was the order performance in those markets, specifically in the quarter? Ryan Marshall : Yes. Mike, the only thing that I'd probably kind of point to there, Bob talked about in his prepared remarks, some of the Del Webb impact in the quarter. Both of those markets are big markets for Del Webb. So beyond some of the community count transition, the community count transition that we're having with some closing and new Del Webbs opening, I wouldn't really go any more granular than that. Michael Dahl : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Susan Maklari : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. My first question is, you mentioned in your comments that the consumer is a bit more unsure, a bit more cautious. How would you generally characterize the health of them as you come into the third quarter and think about the back half? And what do you think is causing that increased caution? Is there anything that you're hearing from your salespeople on the ground that seems to be a more motivating factor in there for them? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Susan, good morning. Thanks for the question. I think it's really around two things. One, psychology and consumer confidence. So when rates uptick in early -- kind of early April, I think that had a real impact in kind of the confidence level of consumer when it comes to is now the right time to buy. We do some surveying on our website with prospective buyers when we ask that question. How do you feel about now is a good time to buy. And it was right in that time period that we saw kind of a noticeable change in kind of response to that question. So some of what, I think, is just the rate change and the things that people are hearing in the news and reading in the newspapers. Some of it is impacted by affordability, how much is attributable to one versus the other hard to know. So I think the prospect that potentially rates might come down later in the year. I think that similarly could play into consumer confidence of buyer psychology in a positive way. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's helpful. And then you also mentioned that you recently reentered Utah. As you think about the -- your current geographic footprint and hitting that 5% to 10% growth target over time, how do you think about the current markets that you're in, are there more markets that perhaps could fit your profile for some of the products that you offer? And anything else that's interesting to you out there from a market or geographic perspective? Ryan Marshall : Yes, we're always looking at where is the population going? And are there new growth cities that could create interesting opportunities for us. With the seven markets that we've entered over the last two or three years, I think we've -- we're in all of the markets that we need to be in today. Could there be opportunities down the road? Sure, I never kind of close that off, but we don't have any kind of remaining major growth cities that I think we've got to get into. And then as it relates to kind of the cities that we're in and the growth targets, we're pleased with how all those cities are performing. And they're small, relatively smaller businesses today and kind of our view of growth in those new markets, that's all embedded into our 5% to 10% growth rate. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thanks for the color and good luck with everything. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Susan. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer for closing remarks. James Zeumer : Thank you. Appreciate everybody's time this morning.

Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Jim. I appreciate everyone joining our call this morning as we discuss another quarter of strong operating and financial results for PulteGroup. As detailed in this morning's press release, driven primarily by a 12% increase in closings, we reported a 16% year-over-year increase in third quarter earnings to $3.35 per share. Inclusive of our strong Q3 financial performance, for the first three quarters of 2024 PulteGroup has realized double digit increases in closings, home sale revenues, and pretax income along with a 22% increase in reported earnings to $10.28 per share. In addition to delivering significant growth in revenues and earnings for the trailing 12 month period, PulteGroup realized a return on equity of 27%, while continuing to drive strong cash flow and lowering our debt to capital ratio to 12%. Our strong financial performance also allowed us to continue returning funds to shareholders. Through the first nine months of 2024, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This is an increase of $200 million or 25% from last year in terms of funds allocated back to our investors. I think these numbers are all the more impressive given the fluctuating backdrop that we've all been working through. Over the course of the year, we've seen the 30-year mortgage rates climb from 6.75% in January, 7.5% in April, only to fall back to 6% in September. And then, of course, a recent climb in interest rates back to 6.75% has the 30-year mortgage rate back to where we started 2024. We track consumer sentiment among visitors to our website and our communities, and as you might expect, buyer confidence ebbs and flows with meaningful changes, or even just volatility and interest rates. This again proved to be the case as buyers reacted to the movement in rates during the third quarter. With mortgage rates hovering around 6.5% to begin the third quarter, buyers were generally less inclined to sign a purchase agreement. As interest rates declined through August and September, however, we experienced a noticeable pickup in overall activity. In fact, of the three months in the quarter, we generated the highest net new orders and absorption paces in the month of September. Driven by September's strong performance, the Q3 absorption pace of 2.4 orders per community per month was certainly above the typical pre-COVID numbers for the third quarter. The recent -- October has shown the highest web traffic, foot traffic and lead volume of the year. However, the recent rise in interest rates has demonstrated a more typical seasonal selling pattern and incentives have remained elevated as a consequence. Between rate volatility, the impact of hurricanes, and the upcoming presidential election, I think the upcoming spring selling season will offer the best assessment of fundamental housing demand. I think buyer reaction to the movement rates, both down and now up, again, affirms that affordability remains a tough hurdle to get over for many potential home buyers. The most recent S&P Case-Shiller Index shows home prices continue to hit all-time new highs, although the rate of appreciation has slowed, which in combination with expected lower mortgage rates could offer some relief to consumers going forward. As has been discussed extensively over the past few years, one of the pressure points that continue to push home prices higher is the fact that after years of underbuilding, this country has a housing deficit estimated at several million homes. The Mortgage Bankers Association issued a useful graphic a few weeks ago that is shown on Slide 15 in today's webcast slides. The graph shows housing stock added by decades since the 1940s. Looking at the graph, you can clearly see the significant drop in production during the past 15 years. To make this point even clearer, we modified the MBA graph by overlaying the growth in U.S. population over the decades. What you see is that just since the 1960s, our country's population has almost doubled to just shy of 350 million people, while housing production has been flat to down over the decades. Given the high cost of homeownership, rate buy-downs remain a powerful incentive in helping consumers bridge the affordability gap. In the third quarter, approximately 30% of our home buyers accessed our national rate program. To take advantage of our national rate incentive, home buyers will typically need to close within 30 to 60 days of signing the contract. So it's important that we continue to have an inventory of homes in production. At the end of the third quarter, 43% of the homes in production were specs, so we are well positioned to meet demand as we close out 2024. Along with benefiting from having inventory available, we are also continuing to make progress in lowering our cycle times. For homes delivered in the third quarter, our average cycle time was 114 days, down from 123 days in this year's second quarter. Cutting two weeks out of our production timeline is an important accomplishment, and it keeps us on track to reach our goal of 110 days by year end and be at 100 days in the first part of 2025. In truth, most of our divisions are already operating at or close to our 100-day ideal target. Our reported average is higher due to a handful of divisions, primarily those with large multi-family business, where cycle times remain elevated. In summary, operationally and financially, we accomplished a lot in the third quarter and are well positioned to have 2024 be a record year for PulteGroup. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our third quarter results. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan. And good morning. Driven by strong closing volumes, our third quarter home sale revenues increased 12% over last year to $4.3 billion. Our higher revenues in the period reflect a 12% increase in closings to 7,924 homes, while our average sales price in the quarter of $548,000 is effectively unchanged from the prior year and the second quarter of this year. Average sales prices by buyer group were also consistent with the prior year. The mix of our closings in the third quarter was 40% first time, 39% move up, and 21% active adult. In the third quarter of last year, the mix of closings was 38% first time, 37% move up, and 25% active adult. A slight decline in the percentage of closings from active adult buyers primarily reflects the timing of active adult community closeouts in 2023 and 2024 that we noted in our sign-up commentary during our second quarter earnings call. We expect a normalization of contribution from our active adult consumers when replacement active adult communities begin opening in 2025. Looking at our orders, net new orders in the third quarter totaled 7,031 homes, which is consistent with the 7,065 net new orders recorded in the third quarter of last year. It's worth noting that our average monthly absorption pace of 2.4 homes in the current quarter remains higher than our historic third quarter pre-COVID average, which was closer to 2.2 homes per month. Within the quarter, we did see a positive impact on monthly orders as interest rates declined from July through September. Compared with the prior year, Q3 orders decreased 3% for first time buyers, increased 6% for move up buyers, and decreased 5% for active adult buyers. Consistent with our guide, we operated out of an average of 957 communities during the quarter, which is an increase of just under 4% compared with the third quarter of last year. Based on activity during the quarter, quarter end backlog was 12,089 homes with a value of $7.7 billion, which compares with the backlog of 13,547 homes with a value of $8.1 billion at the end of the third quarter last year. During the quarter, we started approximately 7,800 homes and ended the quarter with a total of 17,096 homes under construction. These numbers are consistent with Q3 of last year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 7,400 spec homes in production, of which 1,357 homes were complete. This represents about 1.4 finished specs per community, which is consistent with the second quarter of this year. On a unit basis, 58% of our third quarter sales were spec sales, highlighting the importance of having inventory available to meet buyer demand. Buyer interest in spec production has been driven in part by our successful use of mortgage incentives, which are most effective when the consumer expects to close quickly. As always, we will continue to closely monitor consumer preferences for any changes if mortgage rates continue to decline. Based on the units we have under construction and their current stage of production, we currently expect to close between 7,900 and 8,300 homes in the fourth quarter. I would highlight that this keeps us on track to meet or slightly exceed our full year closing target of 31,000 homes. Given the affordability challenges facing today's homebuying consumers and evolving market dynamics in key cities in which we operate, our pricing strategy seeks to ensure we maintain a compelling offering to all consumers. With that said, our average sales price in the third quarter was $548,000, which is consistent with our guide for average pricing to be in the range of $540,000 to $550,000. Looking at the fourth quarter, we currently expect our average sales price to be in a higher range of $555,000 to $565,000. As we have discussed on prior calls, this is largely due to a higher percentage of our closings coming from our western markets where selling prices are above company average. Our third quarter gross margin came in at a strong 28.8%. As we highlighted during our most recent earnings call, our margins in this quarter reflect an increasing percentage of our closings coming from our western markets, which relative to other parts of our business, have slightly lower margins. Our third quarter margins were also impacted by higher incentive costs incurred during the period. Incentives in the third quarter were 7%, which is a sequential increase of 70 basis points from the second quarter of this year. Given competitive market dynamics, higher incentives were needed to help ensure we continue to sell homes and turn our assets. As Ryan talked about, higher demand improved as interest rates declined in the third quarter, but overall market dynamics remain competitive. As such, we expect incentives to remain elevated for at least the remainder of the year. Given the anticipated geographic and product mix of fourth quarter closings and the expected need to maintain higher incentives, we currently expect gross margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 27.5% to 27.8%. Based on our fourth quarter guide, our full year gross margin would amount to approximately 29%. Continuing down the income statement, our reported SG&A expense in the third quarter was $407 million, or 9.4% of home sale revenues. This compares with prior year's SG&A expense of $353 million, or 9.1% of home sale revenues. Our third quarter SG&A expense was in line with previous guidance and keeps us on track for SG&A expense of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues for the full year. I would note that our full year guide excludes the impact of the insurance adjustments recorded in the first and second quarters of this year. Our financial services operations reported another quarter of strong operating and financial results, as third quarter pre-tax income increased 90% over last year to $55 million. For the quarter, our financial services operations benefited from increased volume driven by the higher closing volumes in our home building business in combination with improved capture rates. In addition, we experienced increased profitability, particularly in our mortgage operations, due to improving market conditions driving higher market performance. In total for the quarter, we reported pre-tax income of $906 million, which represents an increase of 7% over the third quarter of last year. Our tax expense for the quarter was $208 million, or an effective tax rate of 23%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter includes a $14 million benefit associated with the purchase of renewable energy tax credits completed in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%, excluding the impact of any potential incremental energy tax credit purchases. Looking at the bottom line, our reported net income was $698 billion, $3.35 per share, representing increases of 9% and 16%, respectively over the third quarter of last year. Earnings per share in the third quarter was calculated based on approximately 208 million diluted shares outstanding, which is down 5% from the prior year as the company continued to systematically executed share repurchase program. Consistent with our stated strategies, we continue to allocate incremental capital to the future growth of our home building platform. In the third quarter, we invested $1.4 billion in land acquisition and development, of which 56% was for the development of existing land assets. On a year to date basis, we have invested $3.7 billion in land acquisition and development, and now expect our full year spend to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.2 billion as our land teams continue to do an exceptional job identifying and structuring land investments that meet our strict underwriting guidelines. Inclusive of our land spend in the quarter, we ended the quarter with approximately 235,000 lots under control, of which 56% were held via option. We continue to make steady progress in increasing the percentage of our land that we control via option as we seek to drive greater balance sheet efficiency in support of higher returns in the future. Based on our land pipelines and the expected timing of community openings and closings, we currently expect to operate out of an average of 950 communities in the fourth quarter, which would represent an increase of 3% over the fourth quarter of last year. In addition to investing in the ongoing growth of our business, we continue to consistently return capital to shareholders. In the third quarter, we repurchased 2.5 billion common shares at a cost of $320 million, for an average price of $126.05 per share. Through the first nine months of the year, we have repurchased 7.6 million shares, or approximately 4% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year at a cost of $880 million or $115.74 per share Following these repurchases, we ended the period with just over $1 billion remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. And finally, we ended the third quarter with a gross debt to capital ratio of 12.3%. Adjusting for the $1.5 billion cash on our balance sheet, our net debt to capital ratio was 1.4%. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of our organization as our local and national teams have done a great job navigating the ups and downs of 2024. Within such an environment, it's more important than ever that we continue to focus on the critical business strategies and tactics that have been instrumental to our success. First, we are continuing to invest in our business. We expect to invest just over $5 billion in land acquisition and development this year, underwriting to the same return hurdles and guidelines that we've had in place for more than a decade. Our disciplined process has allowed us to assemble a robust pipeline of what we believe are well located and high returning projects. In the process of underwriting new deals, we continue our migration toward controlling more land via option. This will be a multi-year effort, but we see the opportunity for increasing our option lot count as a way to enhance returns and help mitigate market risk. We have a long-term goal of getting to 70% option lots, which will be an evolutionary process as we work through our existing communities and add new option lot deals to the overall portfolio. Second, while we continue to invest in new land positions, we have to make sure we are efficiently and intelligently turning our existing land assets. Within our business model, we seek to achieve high returns by balancing the desire to maximize profitability of each home, while making sure we are turning our land assets. We often use the phrase, we can't be margin proud. The gross margin is an important driver of return on invested capital, and we don't want to give away lots that we've worked hard to secure. At the same time, we must be price competitive and offer a clear and compelling value to potential home buyers. I think our third quarter results show this balancing act as we continue to generate historically high gross margins, but we meaningfully increased incentives in response to the more competitive market conditions in which we are currently operating. And third, we must continue to allocate capital in alignment with our long stated priorities. As just discussed, we continue to invest in the ongoing growth of our business through land acquisition and development. If we achieve our 2024 land investment target of $5 billion, our five year land acquisition and development spend will total more than $20 billion. In a world where not in my backyard, it is alive and well, such investment represents countless hours of hard work by our land teams throughout the country. After investing capital to support the ongoing growth of our business, we continue to systematically return funds to shareholders, with 2024 being the fourth year in a row in which we will have returned over $1 billion back to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Over $20 billion invested in land, over $4 billion returned to shareholders and all while building a strong and highly supportive balance sheet with low leverage and high liquidity. I strongly believe this is a balance sheet that can support our growth plans, as well as continue to see us through the ups and downs of buyer demand that inevitably rolled through the housing industry. Let me close by thanking our entire organization for their hard work in delivering PulteGroup's outstanding operating and financial results. Hurricanes made this effort even tougher over the past few months, but I am incredibly proud, although not at all surprised, of how our team rallied to support fellow employees directly impacted by these storms. Your compassionate efforts are why PulteGroup remains a great place to work. Now I'll return the call back to Jim. James Zeumer : Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. And I'll ask Audra to again explain the process and open the call for questions. Audra? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to John Lovallo at UBS. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is maybe just help us on the sequential walk in gross margin from 28.8% in the third quarter to the range of 27.5% to 27.8% in the fourth quarter. Does that assume an incremental step up in incentives? And what is sort of the breakout between the headwind from incentives versus mix? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Hey, John. I think it's reflective of the current market that we're operating in. We highlighted in the commentary as it relates to Q3, coming into the quarter, we had given the guide and said that incentives would be flat. Obviously, they were a little bit richer than we had expected. We had a lot of homes to sell in the third quarter. The activity that we have seen has had that higher incentive load. We still have homes to sell in the fourth quarter. So it really is just a function of what we're seeing on the ground today. Another thing more broadly that impacts this is the slight step down in the active adult as a percentage of the mix. And so, we're -- we highlighted during the second quarter that we saw some closeouts, and so we've got some, for lack of better word, gap outs in active adult. So you've seen the percentage of our total business in active adult shrink a couple of basis points. That obviously has the highest margin contribution. So it's the combination of all those factors. John Lovallo : Understood. Okay. And then, Ryan mentioned, the hurricanes, obviously, there were two pretty devastating storms, Milton really hitting Florida pretty hard, and Helene going up into the Carolinas. What is the impact that you guys perhaps saw in the quarter, and what are you kind of contemplating as we move forward here as a potential impact on whether it's deliveries, orders, or whatever the case may be? Ryan Marshall : Yes, John, it's Ryan. First thoughts and prayers go out to the communities and the individual families who were impacted by the storms. They were certainly both very large and devastating in different ways. I maybe start first by highlighting how well our communities performed. Both our communities that are in active construction as well as homes that we've recently closed. The new construction standards and the quality that we built to, the way the drainage systems are designed, I think are a real testament to just how effective some of those standards are. So we had very little damage in our active communities, which is a good news. The biggest impact is really two things, John. One, loss of time. So the three to four days to shut job sites down in advance of the storm, and then the three to four days kind of following the storms with cleanup. Those are days that are just hard to get back. Power is the second issue. So especially with Milton, the power outages were really widespread in Florida, especially in the Tampa and Southwest Florida areas. So power crews are focused on bringing the power grids back online. They're not as focused on setting new electrical meters for homes that will deliver in Q4. So we're still kind of working to quantify what those exact numbers are. We're confident in the guide that we've -- that Bob has provided to you. And we'll know more, I think, in the coming weeks as the power companies recover. The other maybe kind of third tier item would be some of the municipalities will be a little slower in responding to inspections, as they're dealing with kind of cleanup areas in the hard hit communities. John Lovallo : Great. Thanks very much guys. Operator : We'll move next to Alan Ratner at Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, Ryan. Just following up on the margin guide, you mentioned the mix of the business, the active adult, etc. And you kind of touched on the storms. But I guess this is kind of like a two part question specific to Florida. Your margins in Florida are well above company average. So I'm curious if that's impacting specifically the 4Q numbers, specifically for the guidance. But kind of more importantly, I guess, if you could just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in Florida outside of the storm impact? There's a lot of concern about rising resale inventory in the market, challenged affordability. And I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about that market relative to your very strong margins. Do you think there's an opportunity maybe to take advantage of that with taking share, maybe more incentivizing? Or do you feel like your land position in that market is so strong that you're, as you mentioned, not looking to give away those lots? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan. We're actually -- we remain very bullish on Florida. We talked about it a little bit in the end of our second quarter. And on a positive note, we had a great third quarter out of Florida. And a lot of the inventory trends, both on resale inventory and new inventory, have improved and they're down from where things peaked. So I think that's a positive in a quarter, which is typically one of the slower quarters in Florida is you end the nicer weather summer months up north. As we move into the fourth quarter and we get into what is the traditional [shoulder] (ph) season in Florida, where the snowbirds start coming back into town, I think we're well positioned to have a pretty good fourth quarter. So we're in every major city or almost every major city in Florida. We don't do a lot of business in Miami, but we're -- our brands are really strong there. We've got great communities. So I think Florida will continue to be a positive for us. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Alan, it's interesting. You heard Ryan say how well our markets held up there. So we don't see a mix shift in the fourth quarter pending, of course, the municipality's ability to actually deliver permits, which you think that they will and we think we'll be able to work through. We had highlighted more of the geography and the margin is really that western markets have on a relative basis slightly lower margins for us and that's going to be a higher percentage in the fourth quarter than it was in the third. And then it's the incentives on the spec or entry level probably that have more influence and as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, our expectation is that, the incentive levels are going to stay high. Alan Ratner : Got it. That's helpful, Bob. And you kind of touched on -- you mentioned entry level higher incentives. I guess more broadly, you guys are one of, if not, the most diversified builders from a price point perspective. Can you just drill in a little bit in terms of what you're seeing at the various segments in terms of demand right now between entry, move up and active adult? I know you give the numbers on orders, but that doesn't always tell the whole story, given community count, openings and closings, et cetera. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Alan, I'll take that one. I mentioned in my prepared remarks in October, and we've talked about it on prior calls, we do a survey with buyers that come to our website just about how confident they are about now being a good time to buy. We're at a 12-month high in that number, so I think that's generally a positive sign for the business. Our website traffic, our lead traffic, and our foot traffic into our stores also at 12 month highs. So there's a lot of real positive activity in the top of the funnel. And September was the best month in the quarter. Drilling down into the individual brands, the entry level buyer continues to be most challenged by affordability. So when rates came down in September, I think we saw a nice pickup in buying power that had a very favorable impact to that particular buyer. So I think that's a positive. The move up buyer continues to be really strong for us. And with that being 40% of our business, I think we're really well positioned for that consumer group to continue to perform well in the current environment. And if we're fortunate enough to see some improved rates in the next couple of months as we go into spring selling season, I think that particular buyer group will perform very well. And then active adult, and we've talked about this in years past, this is a buyer group that's probably most impacted by volatility in the market and uncertainty in the market. And right now, the thing that we're hearing the most about is the election. And there's just -- there's a lot of uncertainty around the nonstop barrage that we're getting with the election in a couple of weeks. So we're kind of waiting for the next couple of weeks to be over. And we think that buyer will come back into the market shortly thereafter. Alan Ratner : Appreciate it. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : And we'll go next to Stephen Kim at Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Yes, thanks very much, guys. Appreciate all the information so far. I wanted to focus specifically on timing. I think, you made a couple of comments about what you think may happen next year. I think you indicated that you thought that given the volatility in buyer demand due to rates that maybe we're really going to have to look to the spring selling season to sort of see how the market is ultimately going to settle out. And I think you're right on that. I think that the spring selling season is going to be a big focus probably for investors as well. And so, I'm just trying to get a sense for how you might see timing of certain things you've talked about evolve here over the next -- what it means for timing, I guess I should say. So first of all, you talked about the hurricane impact. You think that some of the delays that you felt from that will impact fully 4Q. Do you think that there's going to be any spillover into 1Q, particularly as it relates to deliveries, the revenues? You talked about the timing of the active adult gap out. I think you indicated that you thought that that would get better in 2025. Can you give us a sense for sort of when in 2025? And when in particular that might affect revenues because, obviously, these homes may take a while to build. Those are the two major ones that I wanted to understand better, what you're thinking about from a timing perspective? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. We've given a guide for Q4 that we're confident in. So we think we've factored in kind of our best estimate of what the hurricane related delays and impacts will be. Things go quicker and better than expected. Potentially we get a few more closings in the fourth quarter, but we're confident in the guide that we've given. Then, as it relates to kind of 2025 and spillover impact from the hurricane, We haven't given a guide at this point. We'll do that at the end of next quarter. History is a guide. I think the system will come back online. And other than, again, power related setting of transformers and energizing communities, those are the things that I think we sometimes see some delays around. But we'll tell you more about that as we get closer. As it relates to kind of active adult, we'll also give you our community count guide next year. Those communities have been on the pipeline for a long time. They're actively being developed right now. So we've got great visibility to when they're going to open. And most of those will start to open in the back half of 2025 and then start to show closings in 2026. But we haven't given a guide for 2025, other than, I would reiterate, we've talked about kind of our long-term growth guide of wanting to operate the business in a 5% to 10% growth window. Stephen Kim : And if we look -- just staying on the active adult side a little bit, it sounds like 2024 -- most of 2024 had maybe a richer mix of active adult than we're going to have in 2025. And just -- and then it will, sounds like it'll become a little richer again. When you're thinking about managing the business over the long term, Ryan, which is more typical of what you think that the product mix, particularly I'm speaking about active adult, is likely to be for your company. Are you managing it with the land that you're sort of purchasing today? Are you managing it to more like of a mix of 2024 or more of a mix of 2025? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Stephen, we're still running the company and managing the land mix. It's important to be 25% -- about 25% of the business. So the current mix in 2024 is actually on the light side. And as these new communities, where we're in a little bit of a gap out, as those come online in 2025, you'll actually, and Bob mentioned it in his prepared remarks, you'll see the mix go back to our kind of typical contribution levels, which is in that roughly 25% overall business. Stephen Kim : Got you. Certainly as it relates to orders. Okay, I got you. That's helpful. Thanks very much guys. Operator : We'll go next to Anthony Pettinari at Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about stick and brick costs in the quarter and then assumptions for 4Q. And it seems like lumber may have been kind of a good guy for part of this year on a year-over-year basis, but it's kind of ticked up recently. Just wondering if you could remind us your lag on lumber prices and any thoughts there? Robert O'Shaughnessy: Thanks for the question. To be honest, we've experienced minimal inflation on our vertical costs this year. We're running right at $80 a square foot, which is consistent with the last three quarters and actually consistent with third quarter of last year. So when we look at it for the full year, we expect kind of a very low single digit inflation on our vertical costs. Ryan Marshall : Anthony, as it relates to lumber, it varies by market. Most of our lumber we buy on a 13-week trailing random length average. It effectively helps lock in the margin at the time of contract with the customer so that we're not experiencing margin volatility during the build process. Anthony Pettinari : Got it. Got it. Thank you. And then just following up on resale inventories. Ryan, I think you indicated inventories were kind of maybe getting a little bit better or normalizing a bit compared to three months ago in Florida. And I was just wondering if there were other markets, Texas or out West where resale inventories are a little bit elevated or conversely where -- markets where inventories feel tight? Ryan Marshall : Yes, I wouldn't highlight any other markets in terms of kind of inventory issues. You mentioned Texas. Texas is the market that's been a little choppier in the last few months. It's a place where there's probably more competition. Every major builder is in every market in Texas. So -- and there were a few markets there. Austin is one I highlight that had unprecedented price appreciation, that there were really high paying jobs that went there post COVID, with a lot of relocations and there were short inventories. So we saw maybe less than -- less than kind of moderated pace around price appreciation. So I think there's a few markets there that are probably still going through some price normalization, those are markets that I think will continue to fare well. There's good jobs there, taxes are relatively affordable and there are places where people want to be. So we're still confident on our Texas markets as well. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Rehaut at JP Morgan. And Michael, your line is open. You may have yourself muted. Michael Rehaut : Yep. Thank you. Thanks, everyone. Good morning. I wanted to circle back a little bit to the cadence of incentives during the quarter. I think you broadly kind of described incentives as having remained elevated throughout the quarter, you expected to remain elevated into the fourth quarter. I was curious on where incentives began 3Q and where it ended. And if there was any decline in incentives in September, as you said, you had particularly strong demand. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Mike, I think you can see from the guide that we've given and we've suggested -- not suggested, we've told you we seen elevated incentives continuing. We didn't really see those mitigate during the quarter. It's worth highlighting, the rate that we're offering is below market already. And so, the movement in the 30-year doesn't really influence us as much as what do we need to do both competitively and from the affordability construct for the consumer. So, if you see a 25 basis point move in the 30 year, we're already 100 plus inside that with our incentive programs. And so, what we're telling you is that the consumer needs some help with the affordability and the incentives in the way we're getting there. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Right. I guess what I'm getting at is, typically when you do see an increase in demand, maybe it's not the initial reaction, but over, let's say, several months, I believe it is kind of normal to see incentives start to take down at that overall higher level of demand kind of works through. So I'm curious, that's really what I'm more curious about, maybe if it's not the first month of a reaction, given that you said it was really more concentrated in September in terms of the improvement in demand. If you know that were to have been more sustained over the following months, if you would normally see that, I think what I would characterize as a typical decline in incentives, at least for the move up buyers perhaps, which aren't helped as much by that rate buy down. That's what I'm more curious about, I guess. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, we'll have to see, I think is the answer to that. We -- rates ticked back up, right? So at the end of the day, we'll see if the Fed continues down a path to reduce interest rates and Ryan said in his prepared comments, we think that the selling season is going to be a better indicator of overall demand. And to your point, if the rate environment improves and demand is strong, yes, I think we'd have an opportunity to reduce our incentive. Michael Rehaut : Right. Secondly, just on from a regional perspective, you kind of highlighted the inventory dynamics in Florida and Texas. I'm curious also for those markets, relative to the rest of your markets, if you've seen an increase in incentives in those markets, just given all the hype around resale inventory levels, if you've seen a significant or unusual increase in incentives in those markets, let's say, today versus six months ago. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Texas, Mike, is the market that I would tell you has probably been more competitive just because of the number of competitors that are there. It's nothing that I would suggest is -- I wouldn't suggest anything, we've done is out of line or is on the level of making us uncomfortable, but probably higher incentives in the Texas markets than what we saw earlier in the year. I think Bob just indicated, we'll see what the fourth quarter kind of provides is possibly we see some reduction in interest rates and that may give us the opportunity to back off of incentives a little bit. Michael Rehaut : All right, thanks so much. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Dahl at RBC Capital Markets. Michael Dahl : Hey, Thanks for taking my questions. We're going to stick with margin dynamics. So, Bob, I think last quarter when you guided to kind of sequential step down in margins inn 3Q and 4Q relative to 2Q, you already anticipated the mix dynamic, so is the mix even different and more of a headwind in 4Q than you originally anticipated or is the right way to think about the sequential and 4Q gross margin really -- you already -- you've highlighted the mix. That's what it is. But the delta versus your prior guide is really the incentive load. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, on balance, it's not changing dramatically. We've got a little bit more Western market business, again, the strength there on a relative basis, it really relates to the incentives or as we've highlighted a couple of times now, it's a challenging affordability equation and we're looking to meet it so that we turn our assets. Michael Dahl : Yes, that makes sense. And then the follow-up is really drilling down on incentives. If you can provide a little more color, you talked about the 7% on total incentive load, and that's up 70 bps sequentially. But in the commentary, it seems like it's suggested it's really that the incremental change may have been predominantly on entry level. Can you help us quantify what the incentives on entry level are or were in 3Q and in your 4Q guide and maybe how that compares quarter-on-quarter. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, that's probably a slice of the [indiscernible] a little too thin. Again, affordability is a challenge for all of our consumers. The entry level feels it first and the most, and so it's going to be a little bit richer for them, but I wouldn't want to parse it quite that thinly. Michael Dahl : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Carl Reichardt at BTIG. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Hi, guys. Nice to talk to you. I want to go back to Florida again, sort of bigger picture and longer term. So obviously, there's been some talk about intermediate term migration patterns changing there, whether that's the frequency of weather or insurance conditions, high prices. So if you're thinking about investing capital, say in 2027 or beyond in new deals there, do these dynamics impact your thinking, especially given those markets are competitive too, as you're talking about Texas? Do you require a higher rate of return to invest there? How do you think about sort of beyond the very -- the intermediate term, the short term, in terms of where you place capital regionally, if you think these dynamics in Florida might be changing, or are you sticking with it? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Carl, thanks for the question. Florida has been very good to our business. We do have a lot of capital invested there today. So for what it's worth, we'd like to continue to see Florida perform well for the investments that we've already made and the capital that's already been committed. As it relates to future stuff, I think we'll take inputs as they come from the market. We're not going to blindly continue to go after things if we're seeing a change in market conditions. I think that's one of the disciplines that we have in our underwriting criteria. I still remain really bullish on Florida. In fact, if you look at the parts of Florida where we're investing, they're a little more inland. They're on higher ground. They're not places that are being impacted by the things that you see on TV. Some of the things that you see on TV are the things that are right on the beach. They're the coastal areas. There are homes that were built in the 70s and 80s, not up to current code. It's devastating. It's terrible. I don't think anybody would want it to happen. But my sense is, our business is not probably directly impacted by some of the things that you're seeing on TV. I'd highlight that some of the moves that you're seeing are kind of within Florida. So they're intra Florida moves as opposed to out of Florida moves. Florida remains a place that's got great quality of life. Maybe it's not as favorable of a deal as it used to be, but still relatively affordable. There's good jobs there. There's no state income taxes. So there are some offsets to some of the things like rising insurance rates and the like. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, Ryan, I appreciate that. And then my second question is on off balance sheet. 56% off balance sheet now or option lots and the 70% is the goal. Is it still your intention to bridge that gap via effective land banking and as opposed to, say, farmer options? And what are you seeing right now in the land banking market in terms of pricing terms? Have the negotiations, the discussions you've had with the large bankers kind of gone as you expected or are you seeing challenges there that you didn't expect? Thanks, guys. Ryan Marshall : Yeah, Carl, we're making nice progress on our land options, up to 56% in the quarter. We've highlighted it'll be a journey. We think it'll probably take somewhere around three -- three to three and a half years in total. As we cycle through our land portfolio to accrete up to the 70% level, but we're clicking off the milestones as intended. So I'm really pleased with how our land teams are performing on that front. We'd expect 50% of our land to be with farmer options or land seller options. The other 20% that we're looking for to be optioned will come from bankers. Our land banking team's done a really nice job building out a portfolio of bankers that we're working with. They're consistent, they're behaving in a very predictable way, and it's working out incredibly well for us. Interest rates, their money is tied to kind of what you see in the interest rate environment more broadly in the market. So we got a little bit of improvement on some stuff that we did in the third quarter. We'll have to see how things go in the fourth quarter, depending on what happens with rates. But we're pleased with how the land banking program is working. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, Ryan. Thanks, everybody. Operator : We'll take our next question from Trevor Allinson at Wolfe Research. Trevor Allinson : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First, a question on conversion rates. You guys talked about 5% to 10% growth annually. I think that included 2025. Just given where your backlog is trending, I think that would imply a pretty notable improvement in backlog conversion rate next year to grow closing to 5% or more. So any commentary on is that what you're expecting, improvement in conversion rates? And then if so, maybe talk about the drivers of that, whether that be the improved cycle time that you guys referenced earlier or any additional spec, any other drivers to call out? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Trevor. Backload conversion rate is something that -- that's a number that can be impacted by two things. One, cycle time, getting better or worse. We indicated in the prepared remarks our cycle times will continue to come down. So we'll certainly get some benefit from that. And then the other piece is spec inventory by the definition, those homes that are in production that are spec are not in backlog. So, a lot of those will sell and convert in the same quarter and they won't show up in that metric. So, I don't want to tell you how to run your models, but given the percentage of spec inventory that we're starting and selling, given the current interest rate environment, I think probably a better metric is to look at homes in production, total homes in production, as a good indicator of whether or not we have the available homes to deliver in the next year's closing volume. Trevor Allinson : Okay, understood. And then I guess the second question then would be kind of following up on that. Finished inventory, 1.4 finished specs per community. That's a little bit above your longer term target number of one. Can you talk about how you feel about your current completed specs level and how you're thinking about spec production then moving forward? Ryan Marshall : Yes, in the current environment we're selling -- almost 40% of our business is coming through first time, which tends to be predominantly spec or mostly spec. And in the current interest rate environment, we actually want higher spec inventory as a percentage of WIP. And when we had historically pre-COVID operated at. So the things that you've heard us most recently talk about is being between 35% and 45% of total WIP and at the end of this most recent quarter we're at 40 -- I think 42% of our total inventory is spec. So we feel like we're right in line there. On the finish side, when we were operating in more of a built to order model, I think one per community was a pretty good number. And we're not abandoning that. We're slightly over that at 1.4. But we don't feel that we have any inventory exposure that's got us uncomfortable at this point. We're selling over 50% of the homes that we're selling right now are selling at some form of spec, so they're at some form of production moving through the pipeline. So we feel pretty good there as well. Trevor Allinson : Okay, makes sense. Thank you for taking my question and good luck moving forward. Operator : Next we'll go to Sam Reid at Wells Fargo. Sam Reid : Awesome, thanks so much. Last quarter I want to say you guys mentioned that land costs were likely to trend up about high single digits in 2024. Just looking to confirm kind of how that trended in the third quarter, what's embedded in the fourth quarter guidance? And then I know you're not necessarily talking 2025 now, but you do have some visibility here. So just curious as to whether that's a reasonable assumption in the next year. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, we did see high single digit lot cost increase in Q3. We do see that in Q4. We have not provided a guide for 2025, but we've said this before. Our lot costs haven't decreased in more than a decade. Land is more expensive. And as you cycle through older land, the stuff coming out is more expensive. We'll give some color as to what that means for 2025 when we give our 2025 guide. Sam Reid : That's fair. And then just sticking to kind of housekeeping questions and apologies if this was already covered, but just wanted to ask about options in lot premiums as a percent of ASP. I want to say last quarter it was around $104,000. Just curious what that was in Q3? And then perhaps what's embedded in guidance for the fourth quarter. Robert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, we were $100,000 in Q3. So relatively consistent, and that is embedded in our guide for Q4 as well. Worth it to highlight that, a lot of that option revenue and lot premium comes from our move up and active adult buyers. So you're at, call it, 60% of our business is driving most of that. And to further the comment that Ryan made earlier, that's not where we're doing most of the speculative building. Sam Reid : No, it makes sense. Thanks so much. Operator : And we'll go next to Matthew Bouley at Barclays. Matthew Bouley : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Back on that 5% to 10% growth that you kind of reiterated as a long-term target, I'm wondering if in fact that is still the plan for 2025 specifically and kind of to what extent you're willing to flex around that growth target maybe depending on where rates are or kind of general consumer demand is, and any thoughts around if there's a margin or incentive trade-off in your minds at which you might kind of dial back that volume growth? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Matt, we haven't given a 2025 guide. We'll do that at the end of next quarter. The long-term guide that we gave was meant to be that. It was kind of a multi-year guide of how we're positioning the business and investing in the land. So 2025 specifically, we will tell you more next quarter. Matthew Bouley : Okay, fair enough. And then maybe one on the balance sheet, just the, I think the net debt capital of 1.4%. I'm curious if the kind of increase in land banking that you're targeting is actually playing into how you're managing the balance sheet here, if there is kind of a need to either hold on to more cash or kind of keep leverage low, if that is playing into it at all, or just more generally, what would be your thoughts around kind of increasing that leverage back to prior levels? Thank you. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Matt, we talked about this a little bit, I think on prior calls. And our view is, we've got a view on how we're investing in the business, how we're growing the business, and that's driving what our capital needs are. We then look to what operating cash flow is, how much of the business investment strategy we can finance with our own cash and with the operating cash flow. And then we go to kind of debt or other capital market mechanisms. I think the way to look at leverage is it's an outcome as opposed to it being a driver. Bob, anything else you\u2019d add there? Robert O'Shaughnessy: No, other than to say in terms of land banking specifically, what it is really going to do is free up cash. As we increase the relative percentage of optionality, our balance sheet on a relative basis gets smaller. So it will give us more choices to Ryan's point about what to do with that cash. Matthew Bouley : All right. Thanks, guys. Good luck. Operator : And that concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Jim for closing remarks. James Zeumer : Appreciate everybody's time today. We're certainly available as the day goes on for any additional questions. Otherwise, we'll look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter call. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob -- sorry, Bob Shaughnessy. My apologies. Please go ahead. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: All right. Thanks, Kelvin [ph]. Good morning, everyone and welcome to today's call. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year financial results. With me today are Ryan Marshall, our President and CEO; and Jim Ossowski, our incoming Executive Vice President and CFO. As always, a copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of this call later today. I want to highlight that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. Most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings including our annual and quarterly reports. With that said, let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob and good morning. We are pleased to speak with you today about how we are running the business and our outstanding fourth quarter and full year financial results. Before Bob gives you the detailed data relating to the fourth quarter, I thought it would be appropriate to summarize some of the company's many achievements in 2024. PulteGroup delivered 31,219 homes in 2024 which represents an increase of 9% over last year. We generated record home sale revenues of $17.3 billion. We once again reported industry-leading full year gross margins of 28.9% and we were able to do this in the face of increasing affordability challenges through the careful management of product offerings, pricing, incentives and absorption paces as we sought to maintain high profitability while ensuring we continue to turn our assets. We continue to manage our overheads efficiently as our reported SG&A amounted to 7.6% of our home sale revenues, including the insurance benefits we recorded in 2024. And we reported strong operating results from our financial services operations which generated $210 million of pre-tax income compared to $133 million last year. As a result, our reported net operating margin was 21.3% for the year. No matter how you look at it, our performance this year was outstanding as we have continued to navigate the turbulence in the markets over the last few years. Our performance is a product of the disciplined and consistent manner in which we are running the business which has allowed us to quickly adjust key business practices to position PulteGroup for ongoing success. Our strong operating performance also allowed us to continue to manage our capital in a manner which leaves us with considerable financial strength. In the year, we generated $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations after investing $5.3 billion in new land. We continue to efficiently increase our land pipeline, putting approximately 43,000 new lots under control. Inclusive of these lots, we now control 235,000 lots, of which 56% are under option. In addition, we returned $1.7 billion to investors including $1.2 billion through share repurchases, the payment of $168 million in dividends and $310 million through the early retirement of senior notes. After all of that, we ended the year with $1.7 billion of cash and our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 11.8%. We are also very proud of the numerous awards recognizing our company's culture, including being named to Fortune's Top 100 Best Companies to Work For in 2024 for the fourth consecutive year. Looking to the future, it remains our view that the long-term outlook for new home construction is positive. The U.S. economy has navigated recessionary concerns well. Employment remains strong and the interest in new homes remains at high levels. In addition, the structural shortage of housing due to underbuilding, ever-increasing land entitlement challenges and ongoing labor availability challenges together with our expectation for continuing lower resale transactions due to a higher for longer rate environment leads us to believe that new home supply will continue to be absorbed without a significant increase in standing inventory. Given our constructive views on the outlook for long-term housing demand, we are planning to continue to invest in our operations to support growing our business over time. Within our operating model, we set our starts pace to align with the sales environment rather than being based on a predetermined annual production volume. As a result, home buying demand will impact our closing volumes and resulting growth from year-to-year, while there can be resulting peaks and valleys in our deliveries, our focus remains on investing in our business to grow volume while maintaining high returns. As we've demonstrated for much of the past decade, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows that will allow us to fund our business investment, pay our dividend and return excess capital to investors, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and flexibility. Our expectation of continued financial success is reflected in this morning's announcement that our Board approved a $1.5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. With many forecasting interest rates to fall, the economy to stay relatively healthy and conditions in the job market to remain favorable there are certainly reasons to be optimistic about housing demand in the coming years. Having said that, affordability challenges and the generally high cost of living are certainly impacting the American consumer. Specific to homebuyers, we believe the recent volatility in mortgage rates, including the current increase back above 7% has contributed to the recent lower activity levels. Against this backdrop, we continue to carefully monitor our investment in production levels with a view towards generating high returns in our business. Consistent with how we have been managing our business in recent years, we are managing our starts activity with a view towards driving our spec inventory to be more in line with our desired levels, including targeting our total spec inventory to be between 40% and 45% of our total units under production. Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a review of our fourth quarter results. Bob? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan. Starting with our income statement, home sale revenues in the fourth quarter were $4.7 billion compared with $4.2 billion in the prior year. The increase in home sale revenues for the period reflects a 6% increase in closings to 8,103 homes along with a 6% increase in our average sales price to $581,000. Our mix of closings in the quarter were comprised of 40% first time, 40% move-up and 20% active adult. Consistent with our commentary over the last 2 quarters, the slight decline in the percentage of closings from active adult buyers reflects the timing of recent active adult community closeouts. We continue to expect a normalization of contribution from these consumers when replacement active adult communities begin opening for sales in the back half of 2025. In the fourth quarter of 2023, closings were 40% first time, 36% move-up, 24% active adult. I would note that the increase in our average selling price in the quarter relative to our guide is due primarily to the increase in the relative proportion of our closings from move-up customers. Our average community count for the fourth quarter was 960 which represents a 4% increase over last year's fourth quarter average of 919 communities and was in line with our prior guidance. Looking at order activity in the quarter, our net new orders decreased 1% to 6,167 homes. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 5% decrease in sales per store and a slight increase in our cancellation rate as a percentage of beginning backlog, partially offset by the 4% increase in our community count. Looking at demand conditions in the quarter. As we noted during our third quarter call, the market in October demonstrated a more typical seasonal demand pattern coming out of the third quarter. This continued through the quarter as consumers faced economic uncertainty related to potential economic changes being considered by the incoming administration and the recent increase in mortgage rates. We also noted then, that given the macro issues consumers face that the spring selling season would offer the best assessment of fundamental housing demand. Fast forward to today and we continue to believe that market fundamentals while still presenting affordability challenges to consumers are supportive of housing and the spring selling season will be the best barometer for how the consumer will behave in today's economic environment. Looking at our quarter activity by buyer group. Fourth quarter net new orders decreased 14% for first-time buyers, increased 15% for move-up buyers and decreased 1% for active adult buyers. We believe these activity levels reflect the continued interest of consumers for new homes but also show the impact of the affordability challenges consumers face particularly for first-time buyers. As a result of our sales and closings activity, our quarter end backlog was 10,153 homes which is down 16% from last year. On a dollar basis, our backlog of $6.5 billion is down 11%. Inclusive of the 7,502 homes we started in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with 16,439 homes in production. 53% of our production is spec including 1,862 finished specs which when combined with cycle times that are now largely in line with our historical norm, put us in a position to meet buyer demand through the year. With that said, in the event that the spring selling season trends towards lower absorption rates, we will reduce our pace of spec starts and communities with higher spec inventory levels so as to better match local selling conditions and help produce standing inventory. As Ryan noted, our goal is to reduce our spec inventory back down to 40% to 45% of our total production by the end of the year. Based on our current production pipeline, we expect to deliver 31,000 closings in 2025, including between 6,400 and 6,800 closings in the first quarter. Looking at pricing. We currently expect the average sales price of closings to be in the range of $560,000 to $570,000 a in each of the fourth quarters of the year. Our fourth quarter gross margin was 27.5% which is down 130 basis points sequentially but within the guide we gave at the end of the third quarter. Consistent with recent quarters, our fourth quarter margins reflect buyer incentives which increased 20 basis points sequentially from the third quarter to 7.2%. Based on our backlog and current sales conditions, we anticipate that gross margins in the first quarter will be approximately 27%. For the balance of the year, we currently expect gross margin to be in the range of 26. 5% to 27% in each of the second, third and fourth quarters. These estimates assume that incentives throughout 2025 will remain consistent with the incentives we recognized in the fourth quarter. I would also point out that our margins beyond the first quarter will ultimately be influenced by the demand conditions during the year as we have a significant number of homes to sell and close over the balance of the year. Moving on to expenses. Our reported fourth quarter SG&A expense was $196 million or 4.2% of home sale revenues which compares with prior year reported SG&A expense of $308 million or 7.4% of home sale revenues. It should be noted that our reported results for the fourth quarters of '24 and '23 included $250 million and $65 million, respectively, of pre-tax insurance benefits. Based on anticipated closing volumes, we currently expect SG&A expense in 2025 to be approximately 9.5% of home sale revenues, including SG&A expense of approximately 10.5% of wholesale revenues in the first quarter. In the fourth quarter, our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $51 million which is up from $44 million last year. The improvement in pre-tax income reflects the increase in our homebuilding closings as well as the continuation of favorable market conditions across our financial services platform. Our reported pre-tax income for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion compared with prior year pre-tax income of $947 million. In the period, we recorded tax expense of $269 million or an effective tax rate of 22.8%. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate includes benefits relating to energy efficiency credits and our purchase of renewable energy tax credits. Projecting ahead, we expect our tax rate in 2025 to be approximately 24.5%, excluding the impact of any discrete tax events, including energy efficiency credits or the purchase of incremental renewable energy tax credits. Looking at the bottom line, our reported fourth quarter results showed net income of $913 million or $4.43 per share. In the comparable prior year period, we reported net income of $711 million or $3.28 per share. Reflective of our strong operating results, we generated cash flows from operations of $1.7 billion in '24. Given our current expectations for operating and financial results in 2025, we expect to generate cash flows from operations of approximately $1.4 million. Turning to our investment and capital allocation activities. We invested $1.5 billion in land acquisition and development in fourth quarter, of which 53% was for development of our existing land assets. For the year, our land investment totaled $5.3 billion, of which 57% was for development. Given our constructive views on near and longer-term housing dynamics, we currently plan to continue investing in land at a rate design to allow us to grow over time. As a result, we expect to invest approximately $5.5 billion in 2025. I would expect that approximately 55% of that spend will be for development. Consistent with my comments about our willingness to slow starts, we would also evaluate our spend on new land assets if absorptions slow as we seek to maintain a high level of returns. Inclusive of our fourth quarter investments, we ended the year with 235,000 lots of control which is an increase of 5% over the prior year. I would highlight that on a year-over-year basis, we lowered our own block count by 2,000 lots, while increasing our lots under auction by 14,000 lots. As a result, our percentage of lots under auction increased to 56%, up from 53% last year. I'm pleased to note that 69% of our new land approvals in the fourth quarter were under some form of auction as we work towards a 70% option mix in our portfolio. Based on the investments we've made and our anticipated community openings and closings in 2025, we expect our average community count in 2025 to be up 3% to 5% in each quarter as compared to the comparable prior year period. Looking at our capital allocation priorities. We continued returning capital to investors in the fourth quarter which included the repurchase of 2.5 million common shares at a cost of $320 million or $129.90 per share. As Ryan noted, our total return to investors in '24 amounted to $1.7 billion, including the $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $168 million of dividends and $310 million through the early retirement of senior notes. Based on the actions taken, our debt-to-capital ratio at the end of the year was 11.8%, down 410 basis points from last year. Adjusting for the $1.7 billion of cash on our balance sheet, our net debt-to-capital ratio is now below 0. I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on our expectations for leverage in the future. As you know, we have historically expressed that our target leverage level has been between 20% and 30% of capital on a gross basis. Due to the strength of our operations and the resulting utilization of our cash flows over the last decade or so, we are well below that target range on a gross basis. And as I noted, we are actually now net debt free. Looking forward, we expect to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support our capital needs. As a result, we are no longer targeting a specific leverage level. Instead, we will allocate our capital in line with our historical practice, continue to prioritize investment in the business and the payment of our dividend with excess capital being used to repurchase our stock and/or retire our debt. Our resulting leverage position will, therefore, be an outcome that is dependent on the decisions we make rather than targeted to a predetermined level. With that said, we would expect to see our leverage remain flat or decline in the future unless there is a transaction where leverage augments our opportunity. Specific to 2025, I would also highlight that our Board recently approved a 10% increase in our dividend per share starting in the first quarter of 2025. As Ryan noted, we also announced a $1.5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization this morning. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan Marshall : Thanks, Bob. At the end of last year, I spoke about our successful navigation of the many challenges we faced in recent years. 2024 was no different as we have dealt with continuing interest rate variability and affordability challenges, significant weather events and ongoing geopolitical issues. I remain extremely proud of how our entire team has responded to these events and the exceptional operating and financial results PulteGroup has delivered over time. I believe that our strategy to focus on disciplined land investment, while maintaining operational and organizational expertise has proven out as we've capitalized our market conditions and have grown earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 30% while delivering an average annual return on equity of 27.8% over the last 5 years. Of course, those achievements reflect what we have done as opposed to what we will do and our future share price performance will depend on what we are able to achieve in the future. To that end, I think it's important to share that we will continue to operate the business in a fashion that seeks to realize strong returns through the cycle. For the long term, we have invested in high-quality land positions that we believe will allow the company to grow over time. Importantly, the optionality we have achieved in our controlled lot position give us the flexibility to pivot if the market faces unexpected headwinds. Similarly, in the near term, we have positioned our inventory production to be sufficient to meet projected demand. It is important to remember that we are seeking to keep all of our communities productive and have made sure that we have the inventory and planned start activity in place to meet that end. However, as discussed earlier, we have higher spec inventory than we've traditionally carried. We've often said, we will not be margin proud and will find pricing to make sure our standing inventory moves. We will continue to do that and as noted earlier, we will work to adjust our pricing and inventory positioning with a view towards driving our spec inventory levels back in line with recent norms. I know stocks reflect performance, so we are seeking to grow our business and deliver ROE that remains among the industry leaders while generating positive cash flow and maintaining a low risk profile which we believe will drive the best returns for our shareholders. With all of that said, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the change that we announced back in July. As you know, Bob notified us of his retirement as our CFO which will be effective after we file our 10-K next week. As part of our succession plan, Bob will transition to a new role for the balance of the year, in part to ensure a smooth transition of the CFO role. But during which time he will also oversee our growth and strategic partnerships platform including our land banking efforts, our asset management committee and our financial services operations. I'd like to thank Bob for his 14 years of service and look forward to working with me over the coming year. I would also like to more formally introduce Jim Ossowski, who will be taking over as our CFO. Jim is a 22-year veteran of Pulte, having come to us after working for a national accounting firm at the start of his career. Jim has served in many capacities for us, including a number of field and corporate leadership positions. In fact, in his current role, he has been involved in all of our significant strategy and operating initiatives over the last 13 years. Throughout his career, he has demonstrated a strong understanding of the homebuilding business and has developed deep relationships with our Board, our senior leadership team and our field operating teams. He has also exhibited a great ability to work with our service providers. Based on the depth and breadth of his experiences and relationships, I am eminently confident in Jim's ability to seamlessly step into the CFO role. And finally, before I close, I would like to take a moment to express my continuing gratitude and thanks to each of our employees for their tireless efforts in supporting the delivering of superior homes and experiences to our homebuyers, while providing outstanding financial returns to our investors. We are now prepared to open the call for questions in order that we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We would ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. Thank you. And I now ask the operator to again explain the process and to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of John Lovallo with UBS. John Lovallo : Bob, best of luck to you. The first question is maybe just help us with the sequential walk from the fourth quarter into the first quarter and then through the remainder of the year for gross margin. I think you're talking about 27% in the first quarter and then 26.5% to 27% in 2Q to 4Q? I mean, how would you sort of bucket the headwinds in terms of maybe working down some of the spec inventory, higher incentives, product mix and then stick and bricks and land cost inflation. Ryan Marshall : Yes, John. The fourth quarter, we feel really good about what our order results were in the fourth quarter, despite it being a more difficult selling environment. The walk from October through December matched what we would consider to be a more seasonal pattern as you progress through the fourth quarter. October being the best, November, a little less and December, the lowest total month. As we turned the corner into '25, we saw the continuation of what we would expect to be a normal seasonal selling pattern including as we move toward the really important spring selling season. We're starting to see some green shoots. There's been some positive order activity. We note that it's still early in that kind of spring selling season and we typically look to first part of February, Super Bowl timing to be the official start but we're encouraged and optimistic by what we're seeing. In terms of the margin guide, we're -- we think we've done a really nice job in a tough environment, balancing the pace price mix and continuing to deliver what are industry-leading gross margins. We noted that 27% will be our Q1 margin guide with the range of 26.5% to 27% for the balance of the year. We believe, based on what we know now today, we've factored in not only what's in our backlog but also what we would expect to sell the standing inventory for inclusive of anticipated discounts which the big assumption that we've made, John, is that those incentives are going to remain consistent with what we've experienced in the fourth quarter. If things turn out differently than that, then we'd certainly have to have a different conversation. But we feel pretty confident about where we sit now that we've positioned ourselves well to continue to have success in Q1 and beyond. John Lovallo : And then, you're talking about... Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Sorry, if I could just add 1 thing. In terms of the structural kind of 26.5% to 27% it does include a flat incentive from the exit from Q4. Just for your perspective, it's assuming relatively flat pricing, you can hear that in the guide we gave on ASPs but I would note that land costs are up about 10% year-over-year. So that's the primary driver of our cost increases. John Lovallo : And then you guys mentioned sort of normal seasonality and then you talked about some green shoots. I mean when we think about the first quarter absorption, I think historically, it's been like 40% positive sequentially into the first quarter. I mean is that a reasonable guide as we look into the spring selling season here? Ryan Marshall : Yes, John, we haven't given a guide. So I think we'll leave the comments kind of as we've made them to this point. But we're encouraged by what we're seeing. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt of BTIG. Carl Reichardt : Congratulations, Bob and welcome, Jim. Bob sounds like you're going to be busier in retirement than you were even as a CFO based on all the stuff you're going to be doing. You talked about incentives, I think, 120 bps this quarter up a bit. Can you talk about the difference between move-up, active adult versus the first-time buyer? Is the spread between the incentives you're using on both really wide? Or is it relatively narrow? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Carl, it's interesting. The -- we haven't provided that level of granularity but I'll offer clearly, the first-time buyer who is focused on monthly payment more than, say, to move-up and active adult gets a richer look. And so especially if it's a government type loan, we've got programs that are for conventional [indiscernible]. So those are typically going to be a little bit more expensive. When you get to that move-up buyer, there might be other incentives that get mixed in with it. We're trying to, again, meet their desires as well as their financial needs. And then when you get to the active adult buyer, a lot of them are taking small or no mortgage at all. So the incentive package looks a little different there. And that's not inconsistent with history, right? I mean that's always been the case. So I don't know if that helps but just a little more color. Carl Reichardt : And then, Bob, in your remarks about leverage, you used the word I hadn't heard in a while which was transaction. And I haven't asked this in a while but Ryan we've talked in the past about the -- your potential interest in M&A or lack thereof. There have been a lot of movement there on the public to private side. I'm curious as to whether or not that it becomes potentially a more interesting opportunity for you given the value of the stock on a relative basis but really also the desire to want to grow the business long term, especially via the new vehicles you'll be using off balance sheet as you go forward. So I love your comments on that. Ryan Marshall : I would summarize it by saying our view is really unchanged. We've always been open to kind of M&A activity with the strong kind of caveat, we prefer to grow the business organically but we look at a lot of things. I was looking at a tally sheet that we use. I think we evaluated something north of 20 plus potential acquisition opportunities last year, most of them pretty small and you'll note that we didn't do any of them. So we look at a lot of things but we're really selective, we're really judicious. We've got a great operating platform. We've got really good relative market share in most of our markets. So we remain open and we'll evaluate a lot of things but we're going to be super thoughtful because of how disciplined we've been in underwriting our own land which has been the primary driver of our outperformance on ROE and we want to stay disciplined with that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Just first question, I guess, relates to the gross margin. Actually, before I say that, welcome, Jim and best of luck to you also, Bob and also our best wishes for Jim Zeumer as well. My first question on margins. Taking the gross margin first. If we look at your guidance that you've given, I'm curious whether that trajectory over the year assumes any benefit at all from having more active adult communities by the end of the year? Or is that margin benefit likely to be only seen in fiscal '26. And can you give us a sense for what you think the sort of the long-term sustainable gross or operating margin, you feel comfortable with this? Ryan Marshall : As it relates to gross margin in active adult specifically, the replacement communities will start to come online toward the middle part of this year, middle to end part of this year from an open -- grand opening and starting sales which means the majority of the margin benefit won't be felt until we get into 2026. And then we haven't given kind of that long-term kind of outlook, long-term view in terms of where margins can go. There's just, I think, too many factors to influence that. We have given a full year guide and for this year which we feel good about given kind of the assumptions that I think we've articulated but we haven't really gone much beyond that in terms of guide. Stephen Kim : It does feel that you've sort of -- maybe some contrary to some competitors have sort of said that you're going to not be beholden to a particular volume level you're going to modulate that with demand and so I would think that you would have a little bit more margin stability than your competitors may which is why I asked the question. But second question, actually, I'm going to shift gears and talk a little bit about the labor side of the equation. Obviously, one of I think the additional big wildcards this spring is going to be whether or not we see any particularly active ICE enforcements in the construction industry. And I'm curious if how or if you are preparing your divisions for any potential rates or maybe more likely just potential slowdowns you've made -- you've seen -- we've seen supply shocks before. We saw them during the pandemic. And I think what a lot of investors think is that in a supply shock and inflation environment, spec building offers a lot of advantages because you're not locking in the home price early and then bearing that cost and margin risk that could come later. So I'm curious, you've said that you're going to reduce your spec activity but would you agree, in general, that in a period of supply shocks that actually spec building can afford some advantages and would you be willing to pivot in some way, if you were to see slowdowns brought on by increased ICE activity? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Steve, it's a good question. Maybe let me first start with -- it's been a long-standing policy of our company trade partners and the labor that are on our job sites, we require verified residency status and/or work permits that allow them to work legally in the U.S. That's been our position for a long time it will continue to be our position. In terms of kind of impacts to the broader labor force, even beyond just construction labor to the extent that there are deportation activities there's no question there'll be less labor available and that will have an impact on all wage rates and we'll certainly have to deal with that as that becomes more clear. To your final question on spec and is spec inventory more beneficial in a supply shock environment. Yes, I think it can be and we certainly saw that in the kind of post-COVID era. What you've seen from our company is that we are capable of running a mostly built-to-order business. We're also capable of running a kind of medium -- kind of low medium to medium spec business as well which is where I think we're operating today. We've set that number of 40% to 45% is what we think is optimal for our consumer and our brand mix but allows us to get the benefits of both the built-to-order margins from the move-up and the active adult buyers that are personalizing their homes but still gives us an spec in the first-time to use the powerful forward commitment incentives and also to protect some of the margin, if there are supply shock -- supply chain shock type situation. So if we're at 53% today, we're going to work it down into the historical range, if we needed to turn up a little bit more, I think we've clearly got the ability to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner of Zelman. Alan Ratner : Congrats to Bob and Jim as well. Ryan, I guess, first question on the closing guide for roughly flat closings and you guys have done such a great job of balancing pace and price over the years. So I understand the interplay there and kind of the perhaps more competitive discounting environment today than maybe we thought we would be in 3 or 6 months ago. But I think you gave kind of a longer-term guide of 5% to 10% growth and I'm just curious as you look at where your margins are today. How much margin do you feel like you would need to give up in order to achieve that 5% to 10% growth that it seems like a lot of the industry is targeting kind of entering 2025. Ryan Marshall : And we still think the long-term growth guide of 5% to 10% is appropriate. And we've -- we really look at it, first and foremost, from the way that we're investing in land and new communities. You'll note that we grew community count in '24 by 4% and we grew our volume deliveries by 9%. As we move into '25 we're projecting for community count to still be in that 3% to 4% range. But we've seen a bit of a pullback on community absorptions given the discounting environment. So we're projecting for a flat volume growth. Certainly, in '24, we got the benefit of moving some home -- more homes out of the backlog as we reduce cycle time but I think we're definitely positioning the company from a land investment standpoint to deliver that long-term kind of multiyear growth target. We do believe, as I highlighted in some of my prepared remarks that from an overall return on invested capital basis, we're comfortable managing the pace price balance in a way that we think yields the best outcome on return. In this current environment, the amount of incremental discount that we'd have to apply in order to drive more volume, we don't believe that's a favorable return outcome. And so we'll continue to pressure test those assumptions. What we've laid out for 2025 is what we think yields the best outcome for how we've positioned the business. Alan Ratner : I appreciate the thought process there. Second question, if we could spend a second talking about Florida. I feel like that's probably a lot of the concerns surrounding your company that we hear from investors, just the exposure there, about 1/4 of your business is in Florida. But not only that, I mean, your margins historically in the state has been incredibly strong. And it feels like with the building resale inventory environment there, concerns over storms and homeowners insurance and just a general softening that if there was a bear point we hear, it's that you're going to have a hard time sustaining those types of margins in Florida. So kind of a big picture question on the state but what are your current thoughts on Florida? And where do you see that business going for you guys going forward? Ryan Marshall : Florida has been just a tremendous market for the company. We're in 5 -- we've got 5 divisions there in most of the major cities in Florida and our move-up and active adult, lifestyle-oriented communities have been really the driver of the outperformance in Florida. Margin and the margin that we generate out of Florida is certainly important. But once again, like you've heard from us a lot, return is the focus. So whether it's an investment in Florida or an investment in Cleveland, Ohio, we're looking at return on invested capital ultimately. Our -- we've got an insurance agency that has been very effective at continuing to be able to provide coverage to our homeowners in Florida. I'd also note and your point about storms concerns around storms are certainly valid. But I'd note that where our communities are located, the way they're built and designed, they're higher, they're further inland, they're less susceptible to some of the kind of tragic catastrophic things that you see of homes and communities that are right on the water. So Florida, there's a lot of sun there. There's a lot of jobs there. There's very -- there's a 0 state income tax. So there's a tremendous -- there's no snow for the northern folks. So there's still a lot of attractive things about Florida despite maybe having a few recent challenges. So we'll keep our head up and pay attention to what's happening in Florida. For the time being, though, we're still very encouraged by what the business can do there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl of RBC. Unidentified Analyst : This is Chris [ph] on for Mike. Just going back to the 26.5%, 27% gross margin range for this year. Is that where you guys are currently underwriting land to on a gross margin basis? Or should we still expect some downward pressure as newer land bids just come through? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Chris, we don't underwrite the margin. We underwrite the return. So the margin guide that we've given is for the closing business in 2025. Unidentified Analyst : Fair enough. I guess -- so what are you guys seeing this year in terms of -- or what are you expecting this year for lot cost inflation and stick and brick inflation? Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: On the sticks and bricks, as we exited '24, we were at about $82 a square foot, so really minimal. As we baked our -- or created our guide for 2025, we again expect very low single-digit increases. That's absent any potential impacts from tariffs that are being discussed but again, expect very low single-digit increases on the house side. Ryan Marshall : And then land, Jim? Jim Ossowski : And on the land side, as Bob stated earlier, we're expecting a 10% increase in land cost this year. Ryan Marshall : And that's inclusive of raw land and develop cost -- developed lot cost overall, inclusive of land and development to be close to 10%. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Michael Rehaut : Bob, best of luck great working with you and Jim, congrats on the promotion. First, I'd love to just review, if possible, just a little bit more around the regions how you feel trends have been, obviously, there's a lot of concern as talked about earlier with inventory levels in Florida as well as Texas but just love to get around your footprint which markets maybe you would characterize as better than average versus worse than average? And how things have trended so far in this year? Ryan Marshall : I'd start by giving some well-deserved acknowledgment to our Midwest and Northeast business. They've been incredibly resilient and have performed well. The discounts that we've had in those locations have been less than in other places. And I think it's reflective of the highs and those spots aren't typically as high and the lows aren't typically as low. So Midwest and Northeast has been a nice bright spot for the company. The other places, I would tell you, have been about as expected and kind of flat year-over-year. We did have a slight decline in our Texas orders on a year-over-year comparison basis. And that's really reflective of what we highlighted with our first-time buyer business being down in the quarter, mostly driven by affordability concerns and we've got a lot of our business in Texas oriented against that first-time buyer business. So -- and then Florida, I think, is the other 1 that folks are focused on. There's a lot of questions. Our sign-ups on a year-over-year basis in Florida were flat. So we're -- and we're -- as I talked about when we asked when I think John asked about Q4 to Q1, Texas and Florida included in this we're seeing some green shoots and some positive energy from the sales floor. So we'll continue to look toward the spring selling season. Michael Rehaut : And second question, I just wanted to circle back to some of Bob's comments earlier on leverage and kind of, I guess, moving off of that prior gross leverage target of 20% to 30%. And it sounds like kind of implying a more persistent even lower level of leverage compared to that. But just to push a little bit on how we should think about share repurchase. I mean, certainly, even with the current trends it looks like your leverage is only going to go further South. And just trying to understand why shouldn't we, as investors or sell-side, buy side expect some level of a solid step-up in share repurchase in 2025 that even with a solid step up, you'd still probably have, by our estimates, even more conservative leverage in '25 versus '24. Is there anything that we're missing? Obviously, I know you like to have some optionality for transactions or other things. But if a lot option is only going up. It looks like your balance sheet even with leverage getting more conservative, could still support a solid step-up in share repurchase in '25. So just trying to understand if we're missing anything or if that's kind of directionally the way we'd be thinking about it. Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Mike, it's a fair question. And I think we've demonstrated over the last, gosh, almost 15 years that we're going to be pretty disciplined about this and seek consistency. So we haven't seen us take a lot of big swings on equity, really, the only time we did was back in 2016 and '17, where we bought a lot of stock in a relatively short period of time. But if you go back over the last 5 years and what we've been doing is using the cash that we're generating in the business to buy back stock or pay down debt. And so have any these in the next 12 months. So I think unless we went out and did a tender which we've done in the past. But unless we did that, I wouldn't expect leverage to move from here. The rate environment tells us how to think about that and the way our bonds trade, obviously. So when we do. If we're buying back debt, it's because it's NPV accretive, right? We want to invest wisely. Could the company withstand more leverage? Absolutely. We were never uncomfortable with 20% to 30%. It's just that the decisions we were making were leading us to a lower number and we wanted to reflect that. We got asked a bunch of times hey, when are you going to borrow to get inside that 20% to 30%? And our answer is always like, if we have a reason to, we will and we'll tell you about it. So we've historically not wanted to guide on share repurchase activities, we've told you. We'll think about that and we have -- haven't yet come to the point of doing that. Maybe Jim will. But at the end of the day, again, I think our track record is pretty consistent and is demonstrating the desire to do more. We've just announced a $1.5 billion authorization increase. So we'll report the news. But again, a fair question. I don't know that we've got a complete answer for you but there you have it. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Trevor Allinson of Wolfe Research. Trevor Allinson : First question, just back on the finished inventory level. I think if I heard you correctly, your finished spec number implies about 1.9 [ph] finished spec per community. Clearly, above your historical 1% on target but then you've also moved your model to be more towards spec. You're talking about moving spec production lower going forward. But I think I also heard you suggest maybe it also depends on how demand plays out in the spring selling season. So I guess the question is, have you already started to pull back on your specs? Are you waiting to see how demand shakes out in the spring selling season and then maybe just some commentary on how you view completed inventory levels in the markets you play in for industry as a whole. Ryan Marshall : Yes, Trevor. So yes, we've already pulled back on start rate. We started doing that in the fourth quarter. And we'll continue to monitor that as we move through the first quarter of this year, the rate at which we start homes will appropriately match to the sales environment. In addition to that and part of the reason we're so comfortable with the inventory level that we have, despite being a little higher than we normally run at. We're optimistic about what the spring selling season to provide, we wanted to have some incremental inventory which we put into the ground. Given the softness of Q4, we probably have a little bit more than we thought we would. But were other than making some modest changes. I don't think that we have an emergency type issue. In terms of kind of inventory in the markets where we compete, certainly, inventory has increased in most regions, both on the new home and the resale level. But even though there's been an increase, we still think that the full numbers are below except for a couple of specific markets, most of the inventory is still way below what would be considered normal. We talked a lot about in the prepared script, we still think demand for housing is at high levels and we've got a healthy economy with a good job market. And affordability is probably the 1 headwind that's out there but I continue to think that the economy will figure out ways to solve for that. Trevor Allinson : I definitely encouraging regarding the spring. And then second question is just on cycle times. How did those trends sequentially -- you previously talked to being under 100 days here early in 2025. Is that the expectation still? And then do you expect to see further improvement beyond that point in 2025? Jim Ossowski : So in the fourth quarter, we were at 111 working days. I tell you, that most of our divisions are down to their pre-COVID cycle time levels. So as we exit the year, we think we've gotten down to our goal and still would expect to be down to 100 in the first half in '25. Ryan Marshall : And Trevor, the one thing I would highlight on that is what's driving the 111 days. We've got 4 or 5 divisions that build big multifamily buildings that take well in excess of the year to complete. So -- but as Jim highlighted, our markets that are kind of pure-play single-family and townhome type builds were below 100 days and we think our construction and procurement teams have done an unbelievable job getting back to that pre-COVID cycle-time level. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley of Barclays. Matthew Bouley : I guess just a couple around the margin. You mentioned kind of finding the right price to move that spec inventory if needed. So I guess just how does that balance with the assumption that you're assuming incentives would stay unchanged from Q4. Like to the extent that finished inventory has been rising. Would that signal that we have not found an equilibrium so the incentives would need to move higher to move those homes? Or is your view perhaps based on history that normal rising seasonality of housing demand into the spring, that would be enough that you wouldn't have to alter incentives. So just kind of any color on how you're approaching that. Ryan Marshall : Matt, it was a fairly -- it was a top sales environment in Q3, back half of Q3 and into Q4 and you can see the heavier incentive load. So I think the short answer is we believe that -- Bob mentioned it but we believe that the incentive load that we had in Q4 as an exit rate is sufficient to deliver the volume and the margin guide that we have in Q1, combined with the healthy economy, combined with spring selling season, when we factor all of those things in. We feel good about the guide that we've given. So I'm not sure that I can probably add any more color. Bob or Jim, I don't know if you guys have anything else you'd add to that to the question. Matthew Bouley : And then the second margin question is just, I guess, to have flat or nearly flat gross margins going forward, I guess everything else needs to be kind of flat or offsetting each other sequentially. So you mentioned land up 10% on a year-over-year basis in construction costs, I think I heard you say up low single digits. And I guess you're guiding to delivered ASP up around 3% in 2025. I'm not sure how much mix plays into that. But again, just given those moving pieces and you do have higher lot in construction costs, I mean what is it that would allow you to hold the margins flat sequentially beyond that first quarter? Ryan Marshall : So Matt, it's basically all of those pieces. You just mentioned, we've got about a 3% increase in ASP. That's enough to offset what we're anticipating in lot and house cost increases. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rafe Jadrosich of Bank of America. Rafe Jadrosich : Just starting first on the incentives. Just can you talk about from a regional perspective were there meaningful differences with the incentive level? Ryan Marshall : Yes, Rafe, we don't give that level of granularity. I think Bob talked a little bit about it on a question that Carl asked earlier by consumer group. The incentives than the types of incentives vary between entry level, move-up and first-time but we typically don't give a breakdown of incentives by region. Rafe Jadrosich : And then, just on the land cost inflation comments of burning up 10% right now. Can you just talk about how you would expect that to trend sort of through '25 or maybe even to '26, like the land that you're contracting today are you seeing any relief on land prices or even like the horizontal development side? And then just within that, can you remind us how much of your own development you're doing right now? And how you expect that to change going forward? Ryan Marshall : So I'll take the last part first. We do the majority of our own development, probably something north of 85%, we directly manage. So the rest of it we buy is finished lots. That's an expertise that we have and certainly something that we think adds value to the overall equation of our offerings. In terms of land, Rafe, we're literally buying land every day. We're not buying it in big chunks. So I think over the last 12 months, you've probably seen a little more stability in raw land prices but it varies market to market. And then there's been on the horizontal side, you've seen a little bit of wage pressure certainly from the heavy machinery operators and some of those things. And then you've got all the things like asphalt pipe, kind of dirt import. There's a lot of moving parts and pieces in there.
